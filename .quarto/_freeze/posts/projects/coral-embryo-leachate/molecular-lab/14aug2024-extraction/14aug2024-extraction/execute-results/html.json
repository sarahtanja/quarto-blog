I pooled 3 samples together and this yielded enough RNA!\n:::\n\n::: callout-note\nI also tested 3 different lysing protocols, and all worked more or less the same. I skipped the Proteinase K digestion as per the 'cells' sample prep instruction in the kit manual. I think I can add this back in if I'm finding protein impurities in the eluted RNA.\n:::\n\n# Extraction Notes\n\ndate: 13-AUG-2024\n\nkit: Zymo Quick-DNA/RNA Miniprep Plus Kit\n\n-   Thaw samples to room temp\n\n-   Vortex to mix\n\n-   Transfer to Qiagin Tissue Disruption Tube\n\n-   Homogenize for 1 minute\n\n-   Centrifuge at 16,000xg for 1 minute to get rid of bubbles\n\n    -   Checked for complete lysis... still saw entact cells so I homogenized again\n\n-   Honogenized for another 1 minute\n\n-   Split into two aliquots of 700uL & transfer to two new nuclease-free tubes\n\n-   Twizzled 123L14, 123 M4, and 123H14 for extra mechanical lysing\n\n-   Added 700uL of DNA/RNA Lysis Buffer to each tube ( a total of 1400uL volume in each tube )\n\n-   Vortex to mix for 5 seconds\n\n-   Check to see that embryos have dissolved and liquid is clear\n\n    -   123C4, clear\n\n    -   123L14, clear\n\n    -   123M4, cell debris\n\n    -   123H14, clear\n\n---\\> Proceed to purification\n\n-   Sequentially transfer 2800uL of each sample in aliquots of 700uL into yellow Spin-Away Filter in a Collection Tube and centrifuge for 30s at 16,000xg **SAVE THE FLOW THROUGH FOR RNA PURIFICATION by tipping flow through into falcon tube**\n\n-   Doubled volume of 100% (200 proof) ethanol to the RNA flow through in a falcon tube and vortexed to mix. End volume of flow through + ethanol = 5mL\n\n-   Sequentially transfer RNA flow-through + ethanol in volumes =\\>700uL into the green Zymo Spin IIICG Column in a Collection Tube\n\n-   Saved 1st 1400uL for protein\n\n    ::: callout-warning\n    This took 7 passes!\n    :::\n\n-   Performed DNase I Treatment on green RNA spin column\n\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    \n    ```{.r .cell-code}\n    DB = 75*4\n    print(DB)\n    ```\n    \n    ::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n    ```\n    [1] 300\n    ```\n    :::\n    \n    ```{.r .cell-code}\n    Dnase = 5*4 \n    print(Dnase)\n    ```\n    \n    ::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n    ```\n    [1] 20\n    ```\n    :::\n    :::\n\n\n    -   I didn't invert to mix... I always lose some volume 'beads' in the lid when I do this. Instead I flicked the tube to mix it and kept all the volume down in the cnical end of the tube. This worked well and I had a full 80uL of treatment per spin column to work with.\n\n-   Warmed Zymo DNase-RNase Free Water to 55C in heat block before elution, and slowly dripped water directly over filter.\n\neluted DNA volume: 30uL in `Zymo DNase-RNase Free Water`\n\neluted RNA volume: 30uL in `Zymo DNase-RNase Free Water`\n\n# Nanodrop\n\n### RNA\n\n| sample_id | ng/uL | A260  | A280  | 260/280 | 260/230 |\n|-----------|-------|-------|-------|---------|---------|\n| 123C4     | 43.3  | 1.083 | 0.611 | 1.77    | 1.27    |\n| 123H14    | 7.8   | 0.195 | 0.060 | 3.25    | -0.94   |\n| 123M4     | 90.8  | 2.271 | 1.125 | 2.02    | 1.86    |\n| 123L14    | 16.0  | 0.399 | 0.196 | 2.04    | 1.99    |\n\n![](nanodrop_13AUG2024.PNG)\n\n::: callout-warning\n123L9 is showing contamination...
