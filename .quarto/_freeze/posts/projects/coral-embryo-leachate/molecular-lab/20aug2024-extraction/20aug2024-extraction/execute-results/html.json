Big change here was homogenizing for 10 minutes, the average yield did seem to improve and I got clear supernatent after the homogenization step. Working with 8 samples at a time was manageable. Still seeing quantity on the lower workable end, but I think that's an artifact of working with small embryo sample starting material size.\n:::\n\n# Extraction Notes\n\nkit: Zymo Quick-DNA/RNA Miniprep Plus Kit\n\n-   Thaw samples to room temp\n\n-   Transfer and pool samples to one Zymo BashingBead Tube\n\n-   Homogenize for 10 minutes\n\n    -   10 min Zymo BashingBead Tube\n\n        -   The 4hpf samples are hardier and take a little longer to lyse than the other embryonic phases\n\n-   Centrifuge at 16,000xg for 1 min to get rid of bubbles\n\n    -   Check for complete lysis of embryos\n    -   Supernatent is clear!\n\n-   Transfer 2 550uL aliquots of cleared supernatent to one new nuclease-free tube\n\n-   Centrifuge at 16,000xg for 1 min to pellet any beads\n\n-   Split cleared supernatent into two aliquots of 530uL & transfer each aliquot to a new nuclease-free tube\n\n-   Add 530uL of DNA/RNA Lysis Buffer to each tube ( a total of 1060uL volume in each tube )\n\n-   Vortex to mix for 5 seconds\n\n    ---\\> Proceed to purification\n\n-   Sequentially transfer 1060uL of each sample in aliquots of 700uL into yellow Spin-Away Filter in a Collection Tube and centrifuge for 30s at 16,000xg **SAVE THE FLOW THROUGH FOR RNA PURIFICATION by tipping flow through into spare collection tube (15mL Falcon Tube)**\n\n-   Doubled volume of 100% (200 proof) ethanol to the RNA flow through in a falcon tube and vortexed to mix. End volume of flow through + ethanol = 4mL\n\n-   Sequentially transfer RNA flow-through + ethanol in volumes =\\>700uL into the green Zymo Spin IIICG Column in a Collection Tube. This should take 6 'spins'\n\n-   Saved 1st 2 spins (1400uL) for protein tube. Once collected place in -20 freezer.\n\n-   Performed DNase I Treatment on green RNA spin column\n\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    \n    ```{.r .cell-code}\n    DB = 75*8\n    print(DB)\n    ```\n    \n    ::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n    ```\n    [1] 600\n    ```\n    :::\n    \n    ```{.r .cell-code}\n    Dnase = 5*8 \n    print(Dnase)\n    ```\n    \n    ::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n    ```\n    [1] 40\n    ```\n    :::\n    :::\n\n\n::: callout-note\n```         \n    I didn't invert to mix... I always lose some volume 'beads' in the lid when I do this. Instead I flicked the tube to mix it and kept all the volume down in the conical end of the tube. This worked well and I had a full 80uL of treatment per spin column to work with!\n```\n:::\n\n-   400uL of Prep Buffer\n-   700uL of DNA/RNA Wash Buffer\n-   400uL of DNA/RNA Wash Buffer, 2min\n-   Centrifuge 2min dry run\n-   Warmed Zymo DNase-RNase Free Water to 55C in heat block before elution, and slowly dripped 50uL of water directly over filter.\n\n# End Products\n\neluted DNA volume: 50uL in `Zymo DNase-RNase Free Water`\n\neluted RNA volume: 50uL in warmed (55C) `Zymo DNase-RNase Free Water`\n\n::: callout-important\nI upped the elution volume from 30 to 50 for RNA because I wanted to make sure the nuclease-free water volume was enough to saturate the whole filter and get the RNA from it... The minimum volume in the kit instructions is 50uL... And I do have an RNA Clean & Concentrator kit that allows me to reduce that if needed. As long as total RNA is at least 100ng, we're good. That means that qubit value (ng/uL) times the elution volume.\n:::\n\n# Qubit QAQC\n\nUsing the Invitrogen Thermo Fischer RNA High Sensitivity Assay Kit.\n\nPrepared working solution for 6 samples and two standards (plus some extra) in a 5mL tube:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbuffer <- 199*10\nprint(buffer)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 1990\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nreagent <- 1*10\nprint(reagent)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 10\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### RNA\n\nstandard 1: 92.70\n\nstandard 2: 1770.25\n\nRunID: 2024-08-21_054905\n\n+---------------+-------------+-------------+\n| sample_id     | qubit_rna_1 | qubit_rna_2 |\n+===============+=============+=============+\n| -   123H9     | 6.66 ng/uL  | 6.68 ng/uL  |\n+---------------+-------------+-------------+\n| -   456M4     | 9.60 ng/uL  | 9.52 ng/uL  |\n+---------------+-------------+-------------+\n| -   789L4     | 8.18 ng/uL  | 8.18 ng/uL  |\n+---------------+-------------+-------------+\n| -   789M14    | 10.6 ng/uL  | 10.4 ng/uL  |\n+---------------+-------------+-------------+\n| -   101112C4  | 15.4 ng/uL  | 15.4 ng/uL  |\n+---------------+-------------+-------------+\n| -   101112H14 | 7.20 ng/uL  | 7.02 ng/uL  |\n+---------------+-------------+-------------+\n| -   131415C9  | 10.7 ng/uL  | 10.8 ng/uL  |\n+---------------+-------------+-------------+\n| -   131415C14 | 11.4 ng/uL  | 11.4 ng/uL  |\n+---------------+-------------+-------------+\n\n# Storage Location\n\nRNA samples are stored in -80C 'JPG Lab Thermo' freezer on shelf 1 in `coral-embryo-leachate RNA` wax freezer boxes with green label tape:\n\nDNA samples (not quantified) are stored in -20C in JPG Lab FSH 236 in shelf 2 in `coral-embryo-leachate DNA` wax freezer box with yellow label tape:\n\nProtein flow-through (not quantified) are stored in -20C in JPG Lab FSH 236 in shelf 2 in `coral-embryo-leachate PROTEIN` wax freezer box with blue label tape:\n",
