If `references.bib` is in your project’s root directory (e.g., inside your Quarto blog repository), use this in your YAML:\n\n```         \nyaml\n```\n\nCopyEdit\n\n`bibliography: {project}/references.bib`\n\n### **How It Works**\n\n-   `{project}` refers to the **root directory of your Quarto project**, which is usually where your `.qmd` or `_quarto.yml` file is located.\n\n    This ensures that no matter where the `.qmd` file is located within subdirectories, it will always find `references.bib` at the project root.\n\n### **Example Project Structure**\n\n```         \nlua\n```\n\nCopyEdit\n\n`C:\\Users\\Minerva\\Documents\\GitHub\\quarto-blog\\ │-- _quarto.yml │-- references.bib │-- index.qmd │-- posts\\ │   ├── post1\\ │   │   ├── analysis.qmd  <-- This can still find references.bib! │   ├── post2\\ │-- styles\\`\n\nEven if `analysis.qmd` is inside a nested folder (`posts/post1/`), using:\n\n```         \nyaml\n```\n\nCopyEdit\n\n`bibliography: {project}/references.bib`\n\nwill always point to `C:\\Users\\Minerva\\Documents\\GitHub\\quarto-blog\\references.bib`.\n\n### **Why This Is Better**\n\n✅ No need for absolute paths\\\n✅ Works across different systems (Windows, macOS, Linux)\\\n✅ More flexible than using `../../` for relative paths\\\n✅ Avoids symlink issues\n\n# September 2024\n\n#### 03-SEP-2024\n\n-   Received confirmation that RNA is in line for QAQC\n\n-   Read manual for Nikon compound scope, setup for making embryology preservation slides & taking photos\n\n#### 02-SEP-2024\n\n-   Submitted Sample Form to Azenta\n\n-   Writing & editing chapter 1 methods\n\n# August 2024\n\n#### 28-AUG-2024\n\n-   Received email confirmation of receipt of RNA at Azenta!\n\n#### 27-AUG-2024\n\n-   Shipped Total RNA to Azenta in 96 well plate on \\~16lbs of dry ice, FedEx Priority Overnight from SeaTac FedEx Office Ship Center\n\n-   Tracking #: 278809181237\n\n#### 15-AUG-2024\n\n-   Met with Jefferey Kim of Azenta GeneWiz\n\n    -   Got a quote for 60 TotalRNA-seq with PolyA selection, 20M reads per sample\n\n    -   For Total RNA in nuclease-free water on dry ice, need 100ng of Total RNA... so if I have 10ng/uL in 30 uL... that means there is 300 ng of Total RNA in that sample. Jeff said 10ng/uL is usually the cutoff. I can send Total eluted RNA in 30uL without normalizing or Nanodropping... they will run RIN scores when they receive the samples.

Measurements were made using Image J software (Rasband 19972018) with digital photographs of each anemone .... - Beck, 2022 WWU Dissertation\n\n-   How do we get scaled images of the oral disc?\n\n<!-- -->\n\n-   downloaded AmScope software for MU503B that is attached to the dissecting scope in PBB: <https://amscope.com/pages/software-downloads>\n\n-   downloaded AmScope manual: <https://storage.googleapis.com/software-download-d79bb.appspot.com/Manual%20Download%20Files/Manual%20Files/Cameras/MU_MD_Series_Camera_Software_Manual.pdf>\n\n#### 21-MAR-2024\n\n-   spent nearly all day drying an edge of each petri dish, and gluing bee-tags to them with superglue, then letting it dry by floating the petri dish on a floating rack in the seatable. Took all day..\n\n-   swapped anemones from upper seatable to lower, changed water in upper, and letting it come down to temp (when doing water changes, cannot do it directly, as header water is at room temp and seatables are at 10C.... How will I deal with this during the experiment when each anemone is in a 200mL jar and I'll be doing water changes every other day\n\n    ```{r}\n    # 72 anemones each in 200mL volume... how much volume I will need to change every other day\n    ml <- 72*200\n    print(ml)\n\n    # how much of each treatment (seawater vs. leachate)\n    ml/2\n    ```\n\n    The amount of microplastic may be our limiting factor for how long the exposure is.\n\nWe have 3 grams of each microplastic type\n\nTo make a batch of leachate according to the Saliu Lab protocol, we have 250 mg of microplastic.\n\n```{r}\n# 3 grams is 3000 mg, how many batches of leachate will each microplastic type make?\n3000/250\n```\n\n12 batches... that's a lot, and should be plenty since it is a highly concentrated amount that will be diluted.\n\nHow will it be diluted?\n\n#### 20-MAR-2024\n\n-   cleaned anemones by picking rocks and debris from them, and squirting with chilled seawater from a lab squeezie bottle. Two were 'escapees', one was fully out of the petri dish! I popped it back in. The ones that are nudging around the edge/lip of the petri dish I use my finger to just push their pedal disc back inside the dish... not sure what I can use to deter them from escape that won't expose them to more chemicals (i.e. tape ahdesive, etc.)\n\n# February 2024\n\n#### 22-FEB-2024\n\n-   Roberts Lab meeting, received feedback on anemone research proposal: suggested I do initial response curves to find at what temp A. elegantissima experience stress, at what microplastic leachate concentration do they experience stress? Measure response variables 'quickly' by respirometry and PAM. Can I make the single stress, multiple response variable, the first chapter of the Master's thesis? Then, two stressors together with \\`omics response variables (once we find the inflection points of stress) can be the second chapter.... Ariana pointed out that the paper reviewers are going to want to know why I chose certain concentrations of microplastic leachate. I have to justify that by doing a response curve first. Learned about Roberts Lab pubathon.\n\n-   Took FireSting O2 to IT to try and get correct drivers on `mariscos` ruggedized laptop to run the program...\n\n-   pyroscience FireStingO2 deemed 'dead' by IT specialist Michael Shriver... the unit won't connect. I sent the following to the Walz product support team Todd Kana (kana\\@bayinstruments.com) & Erich Keim (ekeim\\@walz.com):\n\n    > Good afternoon  Erich and Todd, \n    >\n    > I'm a graduate student researcher in the Padilla-Gamino Lab at the University of Washington, and I'm working with a Walz Mini PAM-II and FireStingO2 oxygen meter that our lab purchased from you as a set.

It was just with our IT specialist for the last few hours (he was attempting to get it to connect by downloading old drivers), and he shared that the laser-cut \\`FiresStingO2\\` light on the instrument would 'pulse' red and then remain off. He deemed the instrument 'dead'... \n    >\n    > This instrument has only been used a handful of times, and it has been kept in good condition (not dropped, or been exposed/submerged in water etc.). \n    >\n    > Have you had this issue before?

Sterile clippers were used to remove an approximately 1-cm diameter region from the coral tissue. The tissue clipping was placed in 500 μL of DNA/RNA shield (Zymo Cat #R1100-50) with 0.5 mm glass beads (Fisher Scientific Cat #15-340-152) and homogenized by vortexing for 1 minute. The supernatant (450 μl) was transferred to a new tube and centrifuged at 9000 rcf for 3 min to remove any debris. The supernatant (300 μl) was mixed with 30 μl of Proteinase K (Zymo Cat #D3001-2-20) digestion buffer and 15 μl of Proteinase K in a new tube using a brief vortex step. Equal volume of Zymo lysis buffer (Zymo Cat #D7001-1-200) was added (345 μl) and extraction was completed as outlined in the manufacturer's protocol. RNA concentration was quantified using the Qubit RNA Broad Range kit (Invitrogen Cat #Q10211) and integrity was assayed with an Agilent TapeStation 4200 system and the RNA Integrity Number (RIN) values ranged from 7.0--8.9. RNA libraries were prepared using the Zymo-Seq RiboFree Total RNA Library Kit (Zymo Cat #R3000) according to the manufacturer's instructions, starting with 125 ng of RNA as input. Prepared libraries were sent to Zymo Research Corporation for sequencing using the Illumina HiSeq for paired end sequencing (2 × 100 base pairs \\[bp\\]).\" - Wong & Putnam 2022 [@wong2022]\n\n#### 11-OCT-2023\n\n-   Attended [ISB](https://isbscience.org/) workshop day 1\n\n    -   Gibbons-Lab github repo: <https://github.com/Gibbons-Lab/isb_course_2023/tree/main>\n\n    -   Course presentation slides: <https://gibbons-lab.github.io/isb_course_2023/16S/>\n\n    -   Multinomial Naive Bayes `qiime feature-classifier classify-sklearn` trained on V4 region of the 16S marker gene\n\n    -   center log ratio transform abundance counts\n\n    -   recommended papers:\n\n        -   [**Microbiome differential abundance methods produce different results across 38 datasets**](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-28034-z)\n\n        -   [**Beta diversity (or Ordination) analysis**](https://www.futurelearn.com/info/courses/exploring-the-landscape-of-antibiotic-resistance-in-microbiomes/0/steps/272960#:~:text=PCoA%20and%20NMDS%20methods%20take,to%20fit%20a%20normal%20distribution)\"PCoA and NMDS methods take the distance matrix as an input and are sensitive to distance method used.

Bacteria distribution is not a normal distribution across populations.... This is a log ratio of (relative abundance/geometric mean). It's a common method for transforming compositional data. For sequencing data normalization does not mean making anything normally distributed but rather putting samples on the same scale...

I did 2 samples because I had a kit that had 2 preps left over. Most of the time spent is in lab bench sterilizing, prepping, labelling, getting ice! Which takes literally a 30 minute hike across campus... But I started at 930AM and finished with Qubit in the FTR Roberts Lab by 4PM. With 2 samples! Extractions take ALL DAY.\n\n#### 17-AUG-2023\n\n-   Are we sure we want to try TriZol for RNA? It isn't a phenol-free kit like the Quick DNA/RNA Miniprep, and we have RNA, we just need to purify it. Tomorrow lets run all eluted RNA through RNA Clean & Concentrator, and check it on Nanodrop! LFG.\n\n-   **THE BLANK HAD 'TOO LOW' DNA IN QUBIT!**\n\n-   Organized extraction notes (handwritten) for extractions 1-8\n\n-   Reserved 1 King Bed in Hotel Block for WSN\n\n-   Applied for WSN Student Travel Grant\n\n    > **How will attending the WSN meeting help you advance your career as a naturalist and/or scientist (75 words max)?**\n    >\n    > Attending WSN would be my first opportunity to share my Masters thesis with the scientific community. As an undergrad, I had a bad first conference experience where I was ridiculed for not having results in a methods poster. I hope to attend WSN because its reputation as a welcoming environment for early-career scientists is the kind of scientific community I wish to be a part of and perpetuate in my own career.\n    >\n    > **What are you working on to improve diversity, equity and inclusion in your community (75 words max)?

My mentee worked hard to complete research that she will present at the upcoming SACNAS conference, and I couldn't be more proud. The training gave me confidence to take on another mentee, this time a Capstone student. Mentorship is a key part of DEI efforts that I find extremely rewarding.\n\n#### 16-AUG-2023\n\n-   asked JPG to buy benchtop UV Sterilizer for me & Callum, got approval! Purchased by Kat same day :D\n\n-   NMDS (non-metric multidimensional scaling) ordination plots\n\n-   walked with Callum, plan to ask JPG to buy Qubit too!\n\n-   Made some taxonomy bar plots and heatmap dendrograms... still working to understand what they mean but they don't look like there is separation between treatments. Haven't gotten any pvalues yet from the composition analyses...\n\n-   Wondering if I should break up the Notebook into diversity & composition? It's getting really long and overwhelming with all the analyses moshed together\n\n-   Still can't `quarto render` in Jupyter Lab on raven server, need to figure out how to get those interactive jupyter plots in my notebook!\n\n#### 15-AUG-2023\n\n-   met with Dr. Amy VanCise about microbiome analysis:\n\n    -   Look into work by WHOI Amy Apprill, Laura Weber, Cynthia Becker\n\n    -   Focus analysis on **community composition** over **diversity** statistics\n\n        > different sampling depths across different samples ... subsample the counts without replacement so that each sample has the same number of features\n\n    -   Differential abundance analysis on microbial community is similar to differential gene expression analysis!\n\n    -   Sampling depth is normalizing between samples\n\n    -   Look into getting a UV Sterilizer\n\n    -   Do the analysis without blank, mock, & env samples included... get a clean look at only treatments\n\n    -   Look into R Vegan package\n\n    -   Phred score: spatial, 30 (or 25) is good to keep\n\n#### 03-AUG-2023\n\n-   Received RNA samples back from UT GSAF\n\n-   Used PCR Inhibitor Removal Kit on five of the samples (see RNA Woes post [here](https://sarahtanja.github.io/quarto-blog/posts/rna-woes/#:~:text=A260%20value.%E2%80%9D-,Zymo%20OneStep%20PCR%20Inhibitor%20Removal%20Kit,-I%20first%20tried)) :\n\n    -   1-CA2a\n\n    -   1-CH2a\n\n    -   1-Ea\n\n    -   1-PA2a\n\n    -   1-PH1a\n\n-   PCR Inhibitor Removal Kit said to add 50-200uL of RNA, but I only could add 30uL. I took the 5 samples from the 96-well plate and augmented them with all the leftover diluted normalized RNA.\n\n-   Nanodrop note: blank should result in a spectrum that varies no more than 0.050A in the 1mm path. For this batch I used the Roberts Lab Nanodrop and the blank was -0.009/-0.008 10mm path.\n\n## July 2023\n\n#### 20-JUL-2023\n\n-   [Integrating QIIME2 and R for data viz](https://forum.qiime2.org/t/tutorial-integrating-qiime2-and-r-for-data-visualization-and-analysis-using-qiime2r/4121)\n\n-   RStudio\\>Project Options\\> Python\\> Python interpreter\n\n-   [Using Python with the RStudio IDE](https://support.posit.co/hc/en-us/articles/1500007929061-Using-Python-with-the-RStudio-IDE)\n\n#### 19-JUL-2023\n\n-   Emailed Jackie about getting another P1000\n\n-   Helped Bob Oxborrow with pipettes for stable isotope sample prep\n\n-   Downloaded QIIME2 to Roberts Lab Raven server for coral-pae-temp repo\n\n-   Shadowed Miranda to learn how to acid wash glassware in 10% HCl:\n\n    -   Scrub and let soak 24hrs in Alconite bath\n\n    -   Rinse 3X in Ultrapure water & shift to 10% HCl bath, let soak for 24hrs\n\n    -   Remove & rinse 3X in Ultrapure water and let sit in Ultrapure water for 24hrs\n\n    -   Remove & let air dry, cover opening with foil\n\n## June 2023\n\n#### 07-JUN-2023\n\n-   Shipped DNA to Mr. DNA and RNA to UT GSAF!\n\n#### 06-JUN-2023\n\n-   Normalized all 20 RNA samples\n\n#### 05-JUN-2023\n\n-   Re-normalized 2-CA2a DNA and successfully got it to 19.5, 19.2 :D\n\n-   Worked all day to normalize RNA with mixed results. In the first batch, 7 out of 20 samples were 'off' of the target concentration of 25ng/uL by enough to make me want to redo them (one was way high at 230ng/uL, others were too low at \\~10ng/uL)\n\n-   I first re-ran the qubit (2nd qubit run) and got really poor results, with all the rerun samples too-low, (even the one that was previously 230ng/uL!?)\n\n-   I then re-normalized the samples and ran them on qubit again (3rd qubit run). In this run 4-PH1b hit the target, the rest were still too low\n\n-   I re-normalized the samples for a third time (with some increasing concentration modifications) and ran them on qubit for a 4th time. In this run 4-PA2a hit the target, the rest were still too low, and 2-PH2a even got worse despite increasing concentration.\n\n-   Ended the day unsatisfied with the following samples too low for normalization despite 4 attempts:\n\n    -   2-PH2a - too low\n\n    -   2-CA2a - 15.0, 15.4\n\n    -   1-PA2a - 10.2, 10.0\n\n    -   1-PH1a - 17.6, 17.6\n\n    -   3-CH2a - 15.0, 14.6\n\n    -   4-CA1a - 14.0, 13.0\n\n#### 02-JUN-2023\n\n-   Normalized DNA (still have RNA left to do)\n-   Tested normalized DNA on Qubit BR DNA assay, results overall were good but a smidge lower than my goal\n-   blank + microbial standard extraction\n\n#### 01-JUN-2023\n\n-   Presented Bioinformatics [final project for FISH 546](https://rpubs.com/sarah_tanja/1048844)\n-   Attended GSR Meeting\n-   Attended Seminar/TGIT\n\n## May 2023\n\n#### 31-MAY-2023\n\n-   wrote `dilute` function to normalize RNA & DNA in [coral-DNA-RNA-lab-extractions](https://github.com/sarahtanja/coral-DNA-RNA-lab-extractions/blob/main/code/03-normalizing.qmd) GitHub repo:\n\n```{r}\ndilute <- function(C1, C2) {\n  # Initialize variables\n  n <- length(C1)\n  C1 <- C1\n  V1 <- numeric(n)  # Initialize V1 vector\n  V2 <- numeric(n)  # Initialize V2 vector\n  \n  # Loop through rows\n  for (i in seq_along(C1)) {\n    # Check for missing data\n    if (C1[i] <= 0) {\n      cat(\"Skipping row \", i, \": Invalid data\\n\")\n      next\n    }\n    \n    # Initialize V1 and V2 for the current row\n    V1_row <- 1\n    V2_row <- (C1[i] * V1_row) / C2\n    \n    # Loop until conditions are satisfied\n    while (!is.na(V1_row) && !is.na(V2_row) && (V1_row < 1 || V2_row < 50)) {\n      V1_row <- V1_row + 1\n      V2_row <- (C1[i] * V1_row) / C2\n      \n      # Break the loop if V1 exceeds a threshold value\n      if(V1_row > 49) {\n        cat(\"Skipping row \", i, \": No valid solution found\\n\")\n        next\n      }\n    }\n    \n    # Store optimized V1 and V2 values in the corresponding vectors\n    V1[i] <- V1_row\n    V2[i] <- V2_row\n  }\n  \n# Create a data frame with C1 column\n  result <- data.frame(C1 = C1)\n\n# Add V1 and V2 columns to the result data frame\n  result$V1 <- V1\n  result$V2 <- V2\n  result$C2 <- C1*V1/V2\n\n  return(result)\n}\n```\n\n-   SAFS Spring Picnic!\n\n#### 29-MAY-2023\n\n-   Worked on Bioinformatics Final Project, RNA expression heat map with Gene Ontology Terms (Protein Functions)\n-   IBIS Celebration of [Nora's Blog](https://norahess.quarto.pub/uw-lab-note-book/)!\n\n#### 25-MAY-2023\n\n-   Hosted Dr. Nicola Smith as the GSIS\n\n#### 24-MAY-2023\n\n-   University of Texas at Austin [Genomic Sequencing and Analysis Facility (GSAF)](https://wikis.utexas.edu/display/GSAF/Home+Page):\n\n    -   [Sample Input Guidelines](https://wikis.utexas.edu/display/GSAF/Sample+Input+Guidelines)\n\n        > TagSeq: 25ng/ul concentration in greater than or equal to 25ul volume (submitting RNA as low as 10ng/ul or as high as 100ng/ul is acceptable BUT ALL samples MUST be submitted at the same or very similar concentrations) \n\n    -   [GSAF Requester Portal Login](https://lockbox-604.my.site.com/s/login/)\n\n    -   [Illumina BaseSpace Login](https://platform.login.illumina.com/platform-services-manager/?rURL=https://basespace.login.illumina.com/platform-home/&redirectMethod=GET&clientId=ps-home#/)\n\n#### 23-MAY-2023\n\n-   completed UW driver safety training\n-   met with Steven Roberts, confirmed that no blank/standard is used for RNA-seq\n-   emailed with Jesse Zaneveld, learned about Zymo mock [microbial community standard](https://www.zymoresearch.com/collections/zymobiomics-microbial-community-standards/products/zymobiomics-microbial-community-standard) and [microbial community DNA standards](https://www.zymoresearch.com/collections/zymobiomics-microbial-community-standards/products/zymobiomics-microbial-community-dna-standard) to be used as positive controls for the extraction (community standard cells) and the PCR library prep and sequencing (community standard DNA) to assess bias in each process.\n-   Put both Zymo standards on purcahsing log, emailed Kat and she said she would buy them tonight with the pcard\n-   Met with Nora, she has made an [awesome quarto blog](https://norahess.quarto.pub/uw-lab-note-book/) for the IBIS celebration to showcase what she has learned. We also talked a bit about stats and need to follow up with what to do when your data is not normally distributed (moving from paired T test to Wilcoxon paired-sample T test)\n-   Tried using `quarto publish gh-pages` command to publish blog\n\n#### 19-MAY-2023\n\n-   Ran Qubit on ex7 samples\n\n-   Extraction #7 (the redo) on samples:\n\n    -   3-Eb\n    -   3-PH1b\n    -   2-PA2b\n    -   2-CH1b\n    -   4-PH1b\n    -   3-CA1b\n\n-   found out how to use quarto to do [Margin References](https://quarto.org/docs/blog/posts/2022-02-17-advanced-layout/#:~:text=.-,Margin%20References,-Footnotes%20and%20the)!\n\n-   found cool article on [Verbatim code chunks](https://themockup.blog/posts/2021-08-27-displaying-verbatim-code-chunks-in-xaringan-presentations/) in R (want to render the code chunk options and show what engine is being used?)\n\n-   dry-ice at biochem stockroom is low, have to check that there will be a replenishment next week so I have enough dry ice to ship samples!\n\n#### 18-MAY-2023\n\n-   wrote script to normalize eluted RNA/DNA\n\n#### 04-MAY-2023\n\n-   received Qubit DNA Broad Range (BR) Assay Kit!\n-   Gotta get P2 DNA/RNA free tips!\n-   ran qubit on DNA & RNA, got great results!\n\n## April 2023\n\n#### 25-APR-2023\n\n-   sorted pipettes with Callum\n-   submitted Bioinformatics Assignment\n-   ordered Qubit DNA BR assay kit\n-   ordered film sealing plate roller\n\n#### 24-APR-2023\n\n-   sent draft letter for NAH experiential learning fund to JPG on Monday April 24th\n\n-   found [96-well PCR shipping guide](https://microbe.med.umich.edu/sites/default/files/downloads/2021_ConsolidatedShippingGuide_0.pdf)\n\n-   emailed Mr.DNA about 20 16S samples\n\n-   read up on NanoDrop vs. Qubit\n\n-   reached out to Sam White about Ubuntu/Windows dual-boot computer in lab 236, which is connected to the Thermo NanoDrop 2000c Sam shared:\n\n    > FYI, if you're solely using the NanoDrop for quantification (i.e. not worried about 260/280), then I'd highly recommend just relying on the Qubit, with both DNA and RNA. The reason for this is that the NanoDrop will almost always over-\"calculate\" your sample concentrations (both RNA and DNA). The reason for this is that the NanoDrop is a spectrophotometer and measures light absorbance. With almost all DNA/RNA isolations, there will be residual DNA or RNA in your sample. The NanoDrop cannot distinguish between the two molecules, because they're both made up of the same material; nucleotides. Nucleotides, regardless of their of their origin will absorb light at an average wavelength of 260nm.Since the Qubit assays use molecule-specific dyes, the dye will only bind to DNA or only to RNA. The dyes will not bind to any carryover of other types of molecules in the sample, so the accuracy (and sensitivity) is much, much higher than the NanoDrop.\n\n#### 21-APR-2023\n\n-   met with JPG April 1on1\n\n    -   talked about travel from Sept. 12 - Oct 9th, missing first 2 weeks of Autumn '23 quarter, focusing that quarter on writing & analysis\n    -   GOAL: have all sequences (16S & Transcriptomes) by September 1st 2023\n    -   Initial 20 samples extracted & sent for sequencing before FHL\n    -   2nd committee meeting to be held once initial 20 samples are run through 1st analysis for 16S & DGE, get advice on strategy for selecting remaining samples\n    -   Follow-up samples extracted & sent for sequencing in July/August\n    -   Send draft letter for NAH experiential learning fund to JPG on Monday April 24th\n\n-   Initial test round 2 samples extracted!!!\n\n    -   3-CA1a\n\n    -   3-Ea\n\n        -   Sampes selected from [extr1](https://github.com/sarahtanja/coral-DNA-RNA-lab-extractions/blob/main/rand-sample-processing.Rmd) using a random number generator\n        -   details can be found in the [coral-DNA-RNA-lab-extractions](https://github.com/sarahtanja/coral-DNA-RNA-lab-extractions) repository\n\n#### 20-APR-2023\n\n-   downloaded fastq files for 'fake data' to continue script for bioinformatics workflow\n-   Received Mortexer!

During the transition period, there will be some disruptions to normal operations, and the continuity of research and teaching and minimizing the impact on faculty, staff, and students is the priority. There will be Restrictive Periods during which no one will be able to process purchase orders or obtain reimbursements in ARIBA. Exceptions may be made for urgent or emergency purchases. Travel reimbursements and non-travel-related reimbursements should be submitted before June 9th, and processing will resume on July 5th.

In cnidarians, endocrine signaling can be used for a variety of functions, including the regulation of growth, development, and behavior.\n        >\n        > One example of endocrine signaling in cnidarians is the release of growth hormones, which stimulate the growth and development of cells and tissues. For example, in some species of cnidarians, the release of growth hormones is regulated by the action of a hormone called insulin-like growth factor (IGF).\n        >\n        > Another example of endocrine signaling in cnidarians is the regulation of reproductive function. In some species of cnidarians, hormones called gonadotropins are released by the endocrine cells of the gonads (sex organs) to stimulate the production and release of gametes (sex cells).\n        >\n        > Endocrine signaling is also involved in the regulation of behavior in cnidarians. For example, some species of cnidarians release hormones called neuropeptides that act on the nervous system to regulate behaviors such as feeding, movement, and response to stimuli.\n        >\n        > Overall, endocrine signaling plays a vital role in the regulation of various functions in cnidarians, including growth, development, and behavior.\n\n​\\*\\*Is this is all true!?

Took all day..\n\n-   swapped anemones from upper seatable to lower, changed water in upper, and letting it come down to temp (when doing water changes, cannot do it directly, as header water is at room temp and seatables are at 10C.... How will I deal with this during the experiment when each anemone is in a 200mL jar and I'll be doing water changes every other day\n\n    ```{r}\n    # 72 anemones each in 200mL volume... how much volume I will need to change every other day\n    ml <- 72*200\n    print(ml)\n\n    # how much of each treatment (seawater vs. leachate)\n    ml/2\n    ```\n\n    The amount of microplastic may be our limiting factor for how long the exposure is.\n\nWe have 3 grams of each microplastic type\n\nTo make a batch of leachate according to the Saliu Lab protocol, we have 250 mg of microplastic.\n\n```{r}\n# 3 grams is 3000 mg, how many batches of leachate will each microplastic type make?\n3000/250\n```\n\n12 batches... that's a lot, and should be plenty since it is a highly concentrated amount that will be diluted.\n\nHow will it be diluted?\n\n#### 20-MAR-2024\n\n-   cleaned anemones by picking rocks and debris from them, and squirting with chilled seawater from a lab squeezie bottle. Two were 'escapees', one was fully out of the petri dish! I popped it back in. The ones that are nudging around the edge/lip of the petri dish I use my finger to just push their pedal disc back inside the dish... not sure what I can use to deter them from escape that won't expose them to more chemicals (i.e. tape ahdesive, etc.)\n\n# February 2024\n\n#### 22-FEB-2024\n\n-   Roberts Lab meeting, received feedback on anemone research proposal: suggested I do initial response curves to find at what temp A. elegantissima experience stress, at what microplastic leachate concentration do they experience stress? Measure response variables 'quickly' by respirometry and PAM. Can I make the single stress, multiple response variable, the first chapter of the Master's thesis? Then, two stressors together with \\`omics response variables (once we find the inflection points of stress) can be the second chapter.... Ariana pointed out that the paper reviewers are going to want to know why I chose certain concentrations of microplastic leachate. I have to justify that by doing a response curve first. Learned about Roberts Lab pubathon.\n\n-   Took FireSting O2 to IT to try and get correct drivers on `mariscos` ruggedized laptop to run the program...\n\n-   pyroscience FireStingO2 deemed 'dead' by IT specialist Michael Shriver... the unit won't connect.

The tissue clipping was placed in 500 μL of DNA/RNA shield (Zymo Cat #R1100-50) with 0.5 mm glass beads (Fisher Scientific Cat #15-340-152) and homogenized by vortexing for 1 minute. The supernatant (450 μl) was transferred to a new tube and centrifuged at 9000 rcf for 3 min to remove any debris. The supernatant (300 μl) was mixed with 30 μl of Proteinase K (Zymo Cat #D3001-2-20) digestion buffer and 15 μl of Proteinase K in a new tube using a brief vortex step. Equal volume of Zymo lysis buffer (Zymo Cat #D7001-1-200) was added (345 μl) and extraction was completed as outlined in the manufacturer's protocol. RNA concentration was quantified using the Qubit RNA Broad Range kit (Invitrogen Cat #Q10211) and integrity was assayed with an Agilent TapeStation 4200 system and the RNA Integrity Number (RIN) values ranged from 7.0--8.9. RNA libraries were prepared using the Zymo-Seq RiboFree Total RNA Library Kit (Zymo Cat #R3000) according to the manufacturer's instructions, starting with 125 ng of RNA as input.

I did 2 samples because I had a kit that had 2 preps left over. Most of the time spent is in lab bench sterilizing, prepping, labelling, getting ice! Which takes literally a 30 minute hike across campus... But I started at 930AM and finished with Qubit in the FTR Roberts Lab by 4PM. With 2 samples! Extractions take ALL DAY.\n\n#### 17-AUG-2023\n\n-   Are we sure we want to try TriZol for RNA? It isn't a phenol-free kit like the Quick DNA/RNA Miniprep, and we have RNA, we just need to purify it. Tomorrow lets run all eluted RNA through RNA Clean & Concentrator, and check it on Nanodrop! LFG.\n\n-   **THE BLANK HAD 'TOO LOW' DNA IN QUBIT!**\n\n-   Organized extraction notes (handwritten) for extractions 1-8\n\n-   Reserved 1 King Bed in Hotel Block for WSN\n\n-   Applied for WSN Student Travel Grant\n\n    > **How will attending the WSN meeting help you advance your career as a naturalist and/or scientist (75 words max)?**\n    >\n    > Attending WSN would be my first opportunity to share my Masters thesis with the scientific community. As an undergrad, I had a bad first conference experience where I was ridiculed for not having results in a methods poster. I hope to attend WSN because its reputation as a welcoming environment for early-career scientists is the kind of scientific community I wish to be a part of and perpetuate in my own career.\n    >\n    > **What are you working on to improve diversity, equity and inclusion in your community (75 words max)? (Examples may relate to personal identify, interest, experience, etc.)**\n    >\n    > I recently took part of the Identity, Belonging, and Inquiry in Science Program, and received special training to mentor students from diverse backgrounds. My mentee worked hard to complete research that she will present at the upcoming SACNAS conference, and I couldn't be more proud. The training gave me confidence to take on another mentee, this time a Capstone student. Mentorship is a key part of DEI efforts that I find extremely rewarding.\n\n#### 16-AUG-2023\n\n-   asked JPG to buy benchtop UV Sterilizer for me & Callum, got approval! Purchased by Kat same day :D\n\n-   NMDS (non-metric multidimensional scaling) ordination plots\n\n-   walked with Callum, plan to ask JPG to buy Qubit too!\n\n-   Made some taxonomy bar plots and heatmap dendrograms... still working to understand what they mean but they don't look like there is separation between treatments. Haven't gotten any pvalues yet from the composition analyses...\n\n-   Wondering if I should break up the Notebook into diversity & composition? It's getting really long and overwhelming with all the analyses moshed together\n\n-   Still can't `quarto render` in Jupyter Lab on raven server, need to figure out how to get those interactive jupyter plots in my notebook!\n\n#### 15-AUG-2023\n\n-   met with Dr. Amy VanCise about microbiome analysis:\n\n    -   Look into work by WHOI Amy Apprill, Laura Weber, Cynthia Becker\n\n    -   Focus analysis on **community composition** over **diversity** statistics\n\n        > different sampling depths across different samples ... subsample the counts without replacement so that each sample has the same number of features\n\n    -   Differential abundance analysis on microbial community is similar to differential gene expression analysis!\n\n    -   Sampling depth is normalizing between samples\n\n    -   Look into getting a UV Sterilizer\n\n    -   Do the analysis without blank, mock, & env samples included... get a clean look at only treatments\n\n    -   Look into R Vegan package\n\n    -   Phred score: spatial, 30 (or 25) is good to keep\n\n#### 03-AUG-2023\n\n-   Received RNA samples back from UT GSAF\n\n-   Used PCR Inhibitor Removal Kit on five of the samples (see RNA Woes post [here](https://sarahtanja.github.io/quarto-blog/posts/rna-woes/#:~:text=A260%20value.%E2%80%9D-,Zymo%20OneStep%20PCR%20Inhibitor%20Removal%20Kit,-I%20first%20tried)) :\n\n    -   1-CA2a\n\n    -   1-CH2a\n\n    -   1-Ea\n\n    -   1-PA2a\n\n    -   1-PH1a\n\n-   PCR Inhibitor Removal Kit said to add 50-200uL of RNA, but I only could add 30uL. I took the 5 samples from the 96-well plate and augmented them with all the leftover diluted normalized RNA.\n\n-   Nanodrop note: blank should result in a spectrum that varies no more than 0.050A in the 1mm path. For this batch I used the Roberts Lab Nanodrop and the blank was -0.009/-0.008 10mm path.\n\n## July 2023\n\n#### 20-JUL-2023\n\n-   [Integrating QIIME2 and R for data viz](https://forum.qiime2.org/t/tutorial-integrating-qiime2-and-r-for-data-visualization-and-analysis-using-qiime2r/4121)\n\n-   RStudio\\>Project Options\\> Python\\> Python interpreter\n\n-   [Using Python with the RStudio IDE](https://support.posit.co/hc/en-us/articles/1500007929061-Using-Python-with-the-RStudio-IDE)\n\n#### 19-JUL-2023\n\n-   Emailed Jackie about getting another P1000\n\n-   Helped Bob Oxborrow with pipettes for stable isotope sample prep\n\n-   Downloaded QIIME2 to Roberts Lab Raven server for coral-pae-temp repo\n\n-   Shadowed Miranda to learn how to acid wash glassware in 10% HCl:\n\n    -   Scrub and let soak 24hrs in Alconite bath\n\n    -   Rinse 3X in Ultrapure water & shift to 10% HCl bath, let soak for 24hrs\n\n    -   Remove & rinse 3X in Ultrapure water and let sit in Ultrapure water for 24hrs\n\n    -   Remove & let air dry, cover opening with foil\n\n## June 2023\n\n#### 07-JUN-2023\n\n-   Shipped DNA to Mr. DNA and RNA to UT GSAF!\n\n#### 06-JUN-2023\n\n-   Normalized all 20 RNA samples\n\n#### 05-JUN-2023\n\n-   Re-normalized 2-CA2a DNA and successfully got it to 19.5, 19.2 :D\n\n-   Worked all day to normalize RNA with mixed results. In the first batch, 7 out of 20 samples were 'off' of the target concentration of 25ng/uL by enough to make me want to redo them (one was way high at 230ng/uL, others were too low at \\~10ng/uL)\n\n-   I first re-ran the qubit (2nd qubit run) and got really poor results, with all the rerun samples too-low, (even the one that was previously 230ng/uL!?)\n\n-   I then re-normalized the samples and ran them on qubit again (3rd qubit run). In this run 4-PH1b hit the target, the rest were still too low\n\n-   I re-normalized the samples for a third time (with some increasing concentration modifications) and ran them on qubit for a 4th time. In this run 4-PA2a hit the target, the rest were still too low, and 2-PH2a even got worse despite increasing concentration.\n\n-   Ended the day unsatisfied with the following samples too low for normalization despite 4 attempts:\n\n    -   2-PH2a - too low\n\n    -   2-CA2a - 15.0, 15.4\n\n    -   1-PA2a - 10.2, 10.0\n\n    -   1-PH1a - 17.6, 17.6\n\n    -   3-CH2a - 15.0, 14.6\n\n    -   4-CA1a - 14.0, 13.0\n\n#### 02-JUN-2023\n\n-   Normalized DNA (still have RNA left to do)\n-   Tested normalized DNA on Qubit BR DNA assay, results overall were good but a smidge lower than my goal\n-   blank + microbial standard extraction\n\n#### 01-JUN-2023\n\n-   Presented Bioinformatics [final project for FISH 546](https://rpubs.com/sarah_tanja/1048844)\n-   Attended GSR Meeting\n-   Attended Seminar/TGIT\n\n## May 2023\n\n#### 31-MAY-2023\n\n-   wrote `dilute` function to normalize RNA & DNA in [coral-DNA-RNA-lab-extractions](https://github.com/sarahtanja/coral-DNA-RNA-lab-extractions/blob/main/code/03-normalizing.qmd) GitHub repo:\n\n```{r}\ndilute <- function(C1, C2) {\n  # Initialize variables\n  n <- length(C1)\n  C1 <- C1\n  V1 <- numeric(n)  # Initialize V1 vector\n  V2 <- numeric(n)  # Initialize V2 vector\n  \n  # Loop through rows\n  for (i in seq_along(C1)) {\n    # Check for missing data\n    if (C1[i] <= 0) {\n      cat(\"Skipping row \", i, \": Invalid data\\n\")\n      next\n    }\n    \n    # Initialize V1 and V2 for the current row\n    V1_row <- 1\n    V2_row <- (C1[i] * V1_row) / C2\n    \n    # Loop until conditions are satisfied\n    while (!is.na(V1_row) && !is.na(V2_row) && (V1_row < 1 || V2_row < 50)) {\n      V1_row <- V1_row + 1\n      V2_row <- (C1[i] * V1_row) / C2\n      \n      # Break the loop if V1 exceeds a threshold value\n      if(V1_row > 49) {\n        cat(\"Skipping row \", i, \": No valid solution found\\n\")\n        next\n      }\n    }\n    \n    # Store optimized V1 and V2 values in the corresponding vectors\n    V1[i] <- V1_row\n    V2[i] <- V2_row\n  }\n  \n# Create a data frame with C1 column\n  result <- data.frame(C1 = C1)\n\n# Add V1 and V2 columns to the result data frame\n  result$V1 <- V1\n  result$V2 <- V2\n  result$C2 <- C1*V1/V2\n\n  return(result)\n}\n```\n\n-   SAFS Spring Picnic!\n\n#### 29-MAY-2023\n\n-   Worked on Bioinformatics Final Project, RNA expression heat map with Gene Ontology Terms (Protein Functions)\n-   IBIS Celebration of [Nora's Blog](https://norahess.quarto.pub/uw-lab-note-book/)!\n\n#### 25-MAY-2023\n\n-   Hosted Dr. Nicola Smith as the GSIS\n\n#### 24-MAY-2023\n\n-   University of Texas at Austin [Genomic Sequencing and Analysis Facility (GSAF)](https://wikis.utexas.edu/display/GSAF/Home+Page):\n\n    -   [Sample Input Guidelines](https://wikis.utexas.edu/display/GSAF/Sample+Input+Guidelines)\n\n        > TagSeq: 25ng/ul concentration in greater than or equal to 25ul volume (submitting RNA as low as 10ng/ul or as high as 100ng/ul is acceptable BUT ALL samples MUST be submitted at the same or very similar concentrations) \n\n    -   [GSAF Requester Portal Login](https://lockbox-604.my.site.com/s/login/)\n\n    -   [Illumina BaseSpace Login](https://platform.login.illumina.com/platform-services-manager/?rURL=https://basespace.login.illumina.com/platform-home/&redirectMethod=GET&clientId=ps-home#/)\n\n#### 23-MAY-2023\n\n-   completed UW driver safety training\n-   met with Steven Roberts, confirmed that no blank/standard is used for RNA-seq\n-   emailed with Jesse Zaneveld, learned about Zymo mock [microbial community standard](https://www.zymoresearch.com/collections/zymobiomics-microbial-community-standards/products/zymobiomics-microbial-community-standard) and [microbial community DNA standards](https://www.zymoresearch.com/collections/zymobiomics-microbial-community-standards/products/zymobiomics-microbial-community-dna-standard) to be used as positive controls for the extraction (community standard cells) and the PCR library prep and sequencing (community standard DNA) to assess bias in each process.\n-   Put both Zymo standards on purcahsing log, emailed Kat and she said she would buy them tonight with the pcard\n-   Met with Nora, she has made an [awesome quarto blog](https://norahess.quarto.pub/uw-lab-note-book/) for the IBIS celebration to showcase what she has learned. We also talked a bit about stats and need to follow up with what to do when your data is not normally distributed (moving from paired T test to Wilcoxon paired-sample T test)\n-   Tried using `quarto publish gh-pages` command to publish blog\n\n#### 19-MAY-2023\n\n-   Ran Qubit on ex7 samples\n\n-   Extraction #7 (the redo) on samples:\n\n    -   3-Eb\n    -   3-PH1b\n    -   2-PA2b\n    -   2-CH1b\n    -   4-PH1b\n    -   3-CA1b\n\n-   found out how to use quarto to do [Margin References](https://quarto.org/docs/blog/posts/2022-02-17-advanced-layout/#:~:text=.-,Margin%20References,-Footnotes%20and%20the)!\n\n-   found cool article on [Verbatim code chunks](https://themockup.blog/posts/2021-08-27-displaying-verbatim-code-chunks-in-xaringan-presentations/) in R (want to render the code chunk options and show what engine is being used?)\n\n-   dry-ice at biochem stockroom is low, have to check that there will be a replenishment next week so I have enough dry ice to ship samples!\n\n#### 18-MAY-2023\n\n-   wrote script to normalize eluted RNA/DNA\n\n#### 04-MAY-2023\n\n-   received Qubit DNA Broad Range (BR) Assay Kit!\n-   Gotta get P2 DNA/RNA free tips!\n-   ran qubit on DNA & RNA, got great results!\n\n## April 2023\n\n#### 25-APR-2023\n\n-   sorted pipettes with Callum\n-   submitted Bioinformatics Assignment\n-   ordered Qubit DNA BR assay kit\n-   ordered film sealing plate roller\n\n#### 24-APR-2023\n\n-   sent draft letter for NAH experiential learning fund to JPG on Monday April 24th\n\n-   found [96-well PCR shipping guide](https://microbe.med.umich.edu/sites/default/files/downloads/2021_ConsolidatedShippingGuide_0.pdf)\n\n-   emailed Mr.DNA about 20 16S samples\n\n-   read up on NanoDrop vs. Qubit\n\n-   reached out to Sam White about Ubuntu/Windows dual-boot computer in lab 236, which is connected to the Thermo NanoDrop 2000c Sam shared:\n\n    > FYI, if you're solely using the NanoDrop for quantification (i.e. not worried about 260/280), then I'd highly recommend just relying on the Qubit, with both DNA and RNA. The reason for this is that the NanoDrop will almost always over-\"calculate\" your sample concentrations (both RNA and DNA). The reason for this is that the NanoDrop is a spectrophotometer and measures light absorbance. With almost all DNA/RNA isolations, there will be residual DNA or RNA in your sample. The NanoDrop cannot distinguish between the two molecules, because they're both made up of the same material; nucleotides. Nucleotides, regardless of their of their origin will absorb light at an average wavelength of 260nm.Since the Qubit assays use molecule-specific dyes, the dye will only bind to DNA or only to RNA. The dyes will not bind to any carryover of other types of molecules in the sample, so the accuracy (and sensitivity) is much, much higher than the NanoDrop.\n\n#### 21-APR-2023\n\n-   met with JPG April 1on1\n\n    -   talked about travel from Sept. 12 - Oct 9th, missing first 2 weeks of Autumn '23 quarter, focusing that quarter on writing & analysis\n    -   GOAL: have all sequences (16S & Transcriptomes) by September 1st 2023\n    -   Initial 20 samples extracted & sent for sequencing before FHL\n    -   2nd committee meeting to be held once initial 20 samples are run through 1st analysis for 16S & DGE, get advice on strategy for selecting remaining samples\n    -   Follow-up samples extracted & sent for sequencing in July/August\n    -   Send draft letter for NAH experiential learning fund to JPG on Monday April 24th\n\n-   Initial test round 2 samples extracted!!!\n\n    -   3-CA1a\n\n    -   3-Ea\n\n        -   Sampes selected from [extr1](https://github.com/sarahtanja/coral-DNA-RNA-lab-extractions/blob/main/rand-sample-processing.Rmd) using a random number generator\n        -   details can be found in the [coral-DNA-RNA-lab-extractions](https://github.com/sarahtanja/coral-DNA-RNA-lab-extractions) repository\n\n#### 20-APR-2023\n\n-   downloaded fastq files for 'fake data' to continue script for bioinformatics workflow\n-   Received Mortexer!

During the transition period, there will be some disruptions to normal operations, and the continuity of research and teaching and minimizing the impact on faculty, staff, and students is the priority. There will be Restrictive Periods during which no one will be able to process purchase orders or obtain reimbursements in ARIBA. Exceptions may be made for urgent or emergency purchases. Travel reimbursements and non-travel-related reimbursements should be submitted before June 9th, and processing will resume on July 5th. Blanket Purchase Orders that are expected to be active past June 30th, 2023, will not be automatically transferred to Workday, and all continuing BPOs must be manually reentered by the College of the Environment.

I searched \"What is the role of endocrine signaling in cnidarian development\" and found an exciting paper titled [**\"Sea Anemones Responding to Sex Hormones, Oxybenzone, and Benzyl Butyl Phthalate: Transcriptional Profiling and *in Silico* Modelling Provide Clues to Decipher Endocrine Disruption in Cnidarians\"**](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fgene.2021.793306/full) authored by Morgan et al. in 2022\n\n-   I explored another AI, [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/), and gave it the prompt \"write me a poem about corals and oysters and mothers\" and it returned:\n\n    -   \n\n        > Coral reefs, a vibrant sea of life, A home for countless creatures, rife. Oysters, clams, and mussels too, All nestled safe, their shells in view.\n        >\n        > But danger lurks, the waters warm, The coral bleaches, it's colors torn. Mother Nature's wrath, a sight to see, But we can help, if only we believe.\n        >\n        > For mothers, fierce and loving beasts, Will do what it takes, to protect at least. Their young and home, with all their might, They'll fight and strive, through day and night.\n        >\n        > So let us join, in their noble quest, To save the reefs, and all the rest. For oysters, corals, and mothers too, Deserve a chance, to make it through.\n\n-   I followed up with a ChatGPT prompt \"what are examples of endocrine signaling in cnidarians?\" and it returned:\n\n    -   \n\n        > Endocrine signaling is the process of communicating information from one cell to another by releasing hormones into the circulatory system or through direct contact. In cnidarians, endocrine signaling can be used for a variety of functions, including the regulation of growth, development, and behavior.\n        >\n        > One example of endocrine signaling in cnidarians is the release of growth hormones, which stimulate the growth and development of cells and tissues. For example, in some species of cnidarians, the release of growth hormones is regulated by the action of a hormone called insulin-like growth factor (IGF).\n        >\n        > Another example of endocrine signaling in cnidarians is the regulation of reproductive function. In some species of cnidarians, hormones called gonadotropins are released by the endocrine cells of the gonads (sex organs) to stimulate the production and release of gametes (sex cells).\n        >\n        > Endocrine signaling is also involved in the regulation of behavior in cnidarians. For example, some species of cnidarians release hormones called neuropeptides that act on the nervous system to regulate behaviors such as feeding, movement, and response to stimuli.\n        >\n        > Overall, endocrine signaling plays a vital role in the regulation of various functions in cnidarians, including growth, development, and behavior.\n\n​\\*\\*Is this is all true!? I'll have to follow-up with my own dive into primary literature...\n\n-   Another ChatGPT AI response, when asked the same questions, but prompted to provide references:\n\n    -   \n\n        > Examples of endocrine signaling in cnidarians include the release of hormones in response to stimuli such as touch, temperature changes, and changes in light intensity.\n        >\n        > For example, the hormone adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (ACAP) is released from cnidocytes in response to a variety of stimuli and activates adenylate cyclase, leading to the production of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and the regulation of various physiological processes.\n        >\n        > Other signaling molecules that have been identified in cnidarians include cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), inositol triphosphate (IP3), and Ca2+-dependent signaling pathways.\n        >\n        > References:\n        >\n        > Levitan, D.
