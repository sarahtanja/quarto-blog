It also facilitates paired sample analysis, where each data point in one dataset is uniquely paired to a data point in the second dataset because we are making duplicate measurements on the *same sample*.\n\nThe challenge is lysing the sample enough to get the bacterial DNA (busting open all those layers of cell membranes!) and retaining host (coral) RNA integrity.\n\nThis protocol follows the Zymo Research [*Quick*-DNA/RNA Mininprep Plus Kit Instruction Manual](https://files.zymoresearch.com/protocols/_d7003t_d7003_quick-dna-rna_miniprep_plus_kit.pdf) with help and optimization from URI Putnam Lab Members Open Lab Notebook posts; such as Emma Strand's notebook post on [Zymo-Duet-RNA-DNA-Extraction-Protocol](https://emmastrand.github.io/EmmaStrand_Notebook/Zymo-Duet-RNA-DNA-Extraction-Protocol/), Kevin Wong's post on [Porites Extractions](https://kevinhwong1.github.io/KevinHWong_Notebook/20201027-DNA-RNA-Extractions-Porites-July-Bleaching-Experiment) and M.E. Schedl's post on [Porites Extractions](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/porites-zymo-rna/), as well as suggestions from a Zymo tech on [March 28th 2023](https://sarahtanja.github.io/lab-book/blog/daily-log/#28-mar-2023-t) regarding [optimized lysis protocols](https://files.zymoresearch.com/documents/bead_beating_short_protocol_tables.pdf) and suggestions from a Zymo tech on May 15th 2023 regarding optimized Proteinase K digestion temperature. This protocol was updated again in August 2023 after initial RNA samples failed library prep[^1] and DNA sample analysis showed high contamination present in the blank.\n\n[^1]: See my post [The RNA Inhibitors](https://sarahtanja.github.io/quarto-blog/posts/rna-woes/) to learn more on this misadventure...\n\n::: {.callout-tip appearance=\"simple\"}\n📞 Zymo is very responsive to phone calls!

Bring working samples on dry-ice back to the lab bench.\n\n    ::: {.callout-important appearance=\"simple\"}\n    Place the ❄️scoopulas❄️ and ❄️mini funnels❄️ in the dry ice 🧊 bucket!\n    :::\n\n-   Don cryo-gloves over nitrile gloves and ⚠️carefully⚠️ dispense a small amount of liquid nitrogen (LN2) into the transfer thermos. **Everyone working with LN2 should have taken the Liquid Nitrogen Online Safety Course found [HERE](https://www.ehs.washington.edu/training/liquid-nitrogen-safety)**\n\n-   Grind each sample with mortar & pestle on LN2 -\n\n    -   ⚠️carefully⚠️ pour a small amount of LN2 into a [sterilized](#sterilize) mortar\n    -   Using [sterilized](#sterilize) forceps, pluck out coral fragments from the cryo vial and place in the mortar until you have about as much material as a lima bean. Material amount does not have to be precise.\n    -   Pestle the coral fragment until it is ground to a powder[^5]. Work quickly to ensure the sample remains frozen. Add more LN2 when it evaporates from the mortar. This step is challenging! LN2 evaporates very quickly and must be replenished multiple times.\n\n[^5]: The coral fragments are prone to 'squirting out' from under the pestle. Don't lose sample material! Rather than use your arms to 'stir' the fragments in a circular motion, crush the fragments by firmly placing the pestle square atop a fragment and press your whole torso body-weight onto the pestle. Think like a hydraulic press!\n\n### Lyse: Bead-Bash Samples\n\n-   Add 500uL of `DNA/RNA Shield` to each 2mL (0.1 - 0.5mm) bead-bashing tube\n\n::: column-margin\nIn initial extractions I only used 500uL of DNA/RNA Sheild and was advised to increase it to at least 800uL by a Zymo rep:\n\n> \"A minimum of 800 µl of liquid volume is what we typically recommend when working with the BashingBead Tubes. This is because anything lower may lead to inefficient bead movement during shaking, oversaturation of content, and difficulties when transferring sample from the tube without disturbing the debris. All of these can lead to impurity by precipitation/clogging in the columns, therefore we highly recommend increasing the amount of DNA/RNA Shield for processing.\"\n:::\n\n-   Use chilled, [sterilized](#sterilize) scoopula and a sterilized chilled mini-funnel to transfer the sample powder to its correspondingly labelled [bead bashing tube](https://www.zymoresearch.com/collections/lysis-tubes/products/zr-bashingbead-lysis-tubes-0-1-0-5-mm)\n\n-   Aim to transfer 500uL of powdered volume (take up about 1/4th of the 2mL tube, or an equal volume as the beads)\n\n-   Cap the bead-bashing tube and shake it like a Polaroid picture\n\n-   Open the tube, and 'top-off' the sample with another 1000uL of `DNA/RNA Shield`, bringing the total volume to 1500uL\n\n-   Vortex to ensure powder is fully submersed in `DNA/RNA Shield`\n\n-   Set bead-bashing tubes in Mortexer and homogenize at high speed for **40 minutes**\n\n### Proteinase-K Digestion\n\n-   Get the Proteinase K out of the -20 freezer & set the heat-block to warm up to 55C for 30mins\n\n-   After bead bashing, tubes are ['intensely bubbly'](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/Larvae-Ex-Protocol/#:~:text=Tubes%20after%20vortexing%20are%20intensely%20bubbly), to tamp down bubbles, centrifuge in the mini-centrifuge for 1min\n\n-   Transfer 600uL of supernatent to a new nuclease-free tube, making sure not to disturb beads and debris at the bottom of the bead-bashing tube[^6]\n\n-   Add Proteinase K & Buffer\n\n    -   Add the appropriate volume of Pro K buffer and Proteinase K (Proteinase K is stored in the -20 after being reconstituted)\n\n    -   (10:1 ratio of sample:digestion buffer) & (2:1 ratio of digestion buffer:Proteinase K)\n\n    -   For tubes with approximately 500uL of sample add:\n\n        -   50ul pro K buffer\n        -   25ul proteinase K\n\n-   Vortex to mix\n\n-   Incubate in the heat-block for 30mins at 55C\n\n-   Vortex to mix & centrifuge on max for 2mins to pellet any debris\n\n-   Transfer 350uL of the cleared supernatent to a new 1.5mL nuclease-free tube, making sure not to disturb any debris at the bottom of the tube\n\n-   Add 350uL of **DNA/RNA Lysis Buffer** to the supernatent(1:1) and vortex to mix\n\n[^6]: Why do we transfer from the bead-bashing tube to two different nuclease-free tubes in this step? Jerry Yu from Zymo says:\n\n    > \"We are worried about the sample debris remaining in the tube, which should still contain protein. One of the reasons for Proteinase K treatment at this step is to break down protein in the solution to make it less viscous/sticky, so the column can process it without issue. By transferring the mixture out, the treatment could be more efficient.\"\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Purify DNA & RNA\n\nTransfer the buffered supernatent (should be a total of 700uL, which can be passed through the filter in one go) to yellow **`Spin-Away Filter`** in a **`Collection Tube`** and centrifuge at 16,000xg for 30 sec\n\n::: {.callout-warning appearance=\"simple\"}\nSave The flow-through in the collection tube for RNA purification! At this step the DNA is in the yellow spin column filter and the RNA is in the flow through.\n:::\n\nTransfer the yellow **`Spin-Away Filter`** to a new **`Collection Tube`**\n\n-   To the RNA flow-through, add 700uL (1:1) of 200-proof ethanol to the flow-through and mix by pipetting up and down 12 times\n\n-   The RNA+ethanol volume is now 1,400uL. In aliquots up to 700uL, transfer the RNA sample to the green **`Zymo-Spin IIICG Column`** in a **`Collection Tube`**, centrifuge, and discard the flow-through. Dab the rim of the collection tube with a Kim Wipe to clean off any residual flow-through. This step binds the RNA to the green column filter. Repeat until all RNA Sample has passed through the filter.\n\n> #### DNase 1 Treatment for RNA\n>\n> -   Add 400uL **`DNA/RNA Wash Buffer`** to the `green Zymo-Spin IIICG Column`, centrifuge and discard the flow-through\n>\n> -   For each sample to be treated, prepare **`DNase 1 Reaction Mix`**: $$\n>     DNase\\, 1\\, volume = 5 \\mu L * (no.\\, of\\, sample\\, preps)\n>     $$ $$\n>     DNA\\, Digestion\\, Buffer\\, volume  = 75 \\mu L * (no.\\, of\\, sample\\, preps)\n>     $$\n>\n> -   Add 75uL of **`DNA Digestion Buffer`** per prep to a new nuclease-free tube\n>\n> -   Add 5uL of reconstituted **`DNase 1`** (thawed if previously frozen at -20C) per sample prep to the nuclease-free tube\n>\n> -   Mix by gentle inversion\n>\n> -   Carefully drip 80uL of **`DNase 1 Reaction Mix`** directly onto the `green Zymo-Spin IIICG Column` filter and let incubate at room temperature for **15mins**\n\n### Wash & Elute\n\n-   Add 400uL **`DNA/RNA Prep Buffer`** to each column and centrifuge at 16,000xg for 30s, then discard the flow-through\n\n-   Add 700uL of **`DNA/RNA Wash Buffer`** [^7]to each column and centrifuge at 16,000xg for 30s, then discard the flow-through\n\n-   Add 400uL of **`DNA/RNA Wash Buffer`** to each column and centrifuge at 16,000xg for 2mins to ensure complete removal of the wash buffer, then discard the flow-through\n\n-   Conduct a dry spin and centrifuge at 16,000xg for 2mins to ensure complete removal of the wash buffer prior to elution[^8]\n\n-   Carefully transfer the column into the nuclease-free tube labelled for containing the eluted DNA/RNA end products\n\n-   Add 70uL **`DNase/RNase-Free Water`** directly to the column matrix and centrifuge at 16,000xg for 30s\n\n-   Place eluted DNA/RNA tubes on ice to continue work, or store in the -80C freezer for later\n\n[^7]: Slowly dispense wash buffer along the sides of the filter like pouring a heady beer down the side of a pint glass. Jerry Yu from Zymo says:\n\n    > \"You are correct with the beer analogy. By slowly dispensing wash buffer along the inner radius of the column, you can rinse off salts/residuals from previous spins, so future spins will be cleaner.\"\n\n[^8]: Another tip from Zymo:\n\n    > The goal of rinsing and reducing the volume of wash buffer is to avoid residual buffer from previous washes to end up in the elution, which will reduce purity. If volume of the wash buffer is increased in the final wash step, make sure to also increase the centrifugation time (e.g., 2 minutes) or include a second spin without buffer (dry spin) to ensure complete removal of the buffer prior to elution.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## RNA Clean-up\n\n### RNA Clean & Concentrator-5\n\n-   Open the **`RNA Clean & Concentrator-5`** kit\n\n-   Add 140uL of **`RNA Binding Buffer`** to each 70uL of eluted RNA sample (2:1, **`RNA Binding Buffer`**:eluted RNA sample)\n\n-   Add 210uL (140+70) of 99.5% (200 proof) molecular-grade ethanol (1:1, **`RNA Binding Buffer`**+eluted RNA sample: ethanol) to each tube\n\n-   Transfer the sample to the `Zymo-Spin IC Column` in a `Collection Tube` and centrifuge at 16,000xg for 30sec\n\n-   Discard the flow through, pat the collection tube dry with a clean kim wipe\n\n-   Add 400uL **`RNA Prep Buffer`** to each column and centrifuge at 16,000xg for 30s, then discard the flow-through\n\n-   Add 700uL of **`RNA Wash Buffer`** to each column and centrifuge at 16,000xg for 30s, then discard the flow-through\n\n-   Add 400uL of **`RNA Wash Buffer`** to each column and centrifuge at 16,000xg for 2mins to ensure complete removal of the wash buffer, then discard the flow-through\n\n-   Conduct a dry spin and centrifuge at 16,000xg for 2mins to ensure complete removal of the wash buffer prior to elution\n\n## Qubit Prep\n\n-   Transfer 1uL of each eluted & purified DNA/RNA sample to their respectively labelled Qubit assay tube, and keep on ice to continue work, or freeze int he -80C for later\n\n## End Products\n\nThe end products are:\n\n-   70ul of DNA in nuclease-free water\n\n-   1uL of DNA in nuclease-free water for Qubit\n\n-   60ul of RNA in nuclease-free water\n\n-   1uL of RNA in nuclease-free water for Qubit\n\nPlace these vials on ice and proceed with Nanodrop & Qubit quantification: - [Nanodrop Protocol]() - [Qubit RNA Broad Range Protocol]()\n\nOR, to continue lab-work later,\n\nPlace them in a wax freezer box, label the box, and freeze them in the -80C.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\nThe aim of this protocol is to take coral fragments that have been snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and extract both DNA for downstream archaea & bacteria microbiome 16S Microbiome Sequencing and RNA for downstream coral-host tissue Tag-seq or RNA-seq analysis.\n\n> In plain, I want to answer 'who is there?' regarding the bacterial community, and 'what is the coral doing?' regarding gene expression.\n\nThe benefits of doing DNA and RNA extraction together are that it saves time, money, & sample material.

Material amount does not have to be precise.\n    -   Pestle the coral fragment until it is ground to a powder[^5]. Work quickly to ensure the sample remains frozen. Add more LN2 when it evaporates from the mortar. This step is challenging! LN2 evaporates very quickly and must be replenished multiple times.\n\n[^5]: The coral fragments are prone to 'squirting out' from under the pestle. Don't lose sample material! Rather than use your arms to 'stir' the fragments in a circular motion, crush the fragments by firmly placing the pestle square atop a fragment and press your whole torso body-weight onto the pestle. Think like a hydraulic press!\n\n### Lyse: Bead-Bash Samples\n\n-   Add 500uL of `DNA/RNA Shield` to each 2mL (0.1 - 0.5mm) bead-bashing tube\n\n::: column-margin\nIn initial extractions I only used 500uL of DNA/RNA Sheild and was advised to increase it to at least 800uL by a Zymo rep:\n\n> \"A minimum of 800 µl of liquid volume is what we typically recommend when working with the BashingBead Tubes. This is because anything lower may lead to inefficient bead movement during shaking, oversaturation of content, and difficulties when transferring sample from the tube without disturbing the debris. All of these can lead to impurity by precipitation/clogging in the columns, therefore we highly recommend increasing the amount of DNA/RNA Shield for processing.\"\n:::\n\n-   Use chilled, [sterilized](#sterilize) scoopula and a sterilized chilled mini-funnel to transfer the sample powder to its correspondingly labelled [bead bashing tube](https://www.zymoresearch.com/collections/lysis-tubes/products/zr-bashingbead-lysis-tubes-0-1-0-5-mm)\n\n-   Aim to transfer 500uL of powdered volume (take up about 1/4th of the 2mL tube, or an equal volume as the beads)\n\n-   Cap the bead-bashing tube and shake it like a Polaroid picture\n\n-   Open the tube, and 'top-off' the sample with another 1000uL of `DNA/RNA Shield`, bringing the total volume to 1500uL\n\n-   Vortex to ensure powder is fully submersed in `DNA/RNA Shield`\n\n-   Set bead-bashing tubes in Mortexer and homogenize at high speed for **40 minutes**\n\n### Proteinase-K Digestion\n\n-   Get the Proteinase K out of the -20 freezer & set the heat-block to warm up to 55C for 30mins\n\n-   After bead bashing, tubes are ['intensely bubbly'](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/Larvae-Ex-Protocol/#:~:text=Tubes%20after%20vortexing%20are%20intensely%20bubbly), to tamp down bubbles, centrifuge in the mini-centrifuge for 1min\n\n-   Transfer 600uL of supernatent to a new nuclease-free tube, making sure not to disturb beads and debris at the bottom of the bead-bashing tube[^6]\n\n-   Add Proteinase K & Buffer\n\n    -   Add the appropriate volume of Pro K buffer and Proteinase K (Proteinase K is stored in the -20 after being reconstituted)\n\n    -   (10:1 ratio of sample:digestion buffer) & (2:1 ratio of digestion buffer:Proteinase K)\n\n    -   For tubes with approximately 500uL of sample add:\n\n        -   50ul pro K buffer\n        -   25ul proteinase K\n\n-   Vortex to mix\n\n-   Incubate in the heat-block for 30mins at 55C\n\n-   Vortex to mix & centrifuge on max for 2mins to pellet any debris\n\n-   Transfer 350uL of the cleared supernatent to a new 1.5mL nuclease-free tube, making sure not to disturb any debris at the bottom of the tube\n\n-   Add 350uL of **DNA/RNA Lysis Buffer** to the supernatent(1:1) and vortex to mix\n\n[^6]: Why do we transfer from the bead-bashing tube to two different nuclease-free tubes in this step? Jerry Yu from Zymo says:\n\n    > \"We are worried about the sample debris remaining in the tube, which should still contain protein. One of the reasons for Proteinase K treatment at this step is to break down protein in the solution to make it less viscous/sticky, so the column can process it without issue.

Jerry Yu from Zymo says:\n\n    > \"You are correct with the beer analogy. By slowly dispensing wash buffer along the inner radius of the column, you can rinse off salts/residuals from previous spins, so future spins will be cleaner.\"\n\n[^8]: Another tip from Zymo:\n\n    > The goal of rinsing and reducing the volume of wash buffer is to avoid residual buffer from previous washes to end up in the elution, which will reduce purity. If volume of the wash buffer is increased in the final wash step, make sure to also increase the centrifugation time (e.g., 2 minutes) or include a second spin without buffer (dry spin) to ensure complete removal of the buffer prior to elution.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## RNA Clean-up\n\n### RNA Clean & Concentrator-5\n\n-   Open the **`RNA
