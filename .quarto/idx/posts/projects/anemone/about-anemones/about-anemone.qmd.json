Over 3 d of field study, with different levels of sunlight and wind, body temperatures of A. elegantissima in our treatments often exceeded 24°C, and reached 32°C in the most extreme cases.

Since ZX also displayed photoinhibition at 1,400 lmolÆm--2Æs--1, yet did not show a reduction in MI, the onset of the deleterious effects of damage repair would seem to occur at intensities above 1,400 lmolÆm--2Æ s--1. In contrast, anemone metabolic rates were elevated at 2,000 lmolÆm--2Æs--1; it may simply be that the host requires more energy and organic resources to meet its elevated respiratory demands, and the ZX symbiont provides both at the expense of its own growth @e.2002.\n>\n> -   Not light saturated up to $550 mu/ mol m^{-2} s^{-1}$ (Verde & McCloskey 1996)\n>\n> -   *B. muscatinei* peaked at \\$800 mu/ mol m\\^{-2} s\\^{-1}\\$ @e.2002 .\n\n## Symbiosis\n\n***A. elegantissima*** **gains symbionts through horizontal transmission** [@lajeunesse2000a]**.

The anemones 'cull' or 'weed' the symbionts to maintain an optimal symbiont population density.\n\nThe optimized symbiont density is reported in the literature as 10^6^ cells·mg^-1^ of host protein and 1-5·10^6^ cells·cm^-2^ [@mccloskey1996].\n\n> Sea anemones of the genus Anthopleura along northeast Pacific intertidal shores engage in a particularly unique symbiosis with two especially phylogenetically and physiologically different symbionts: the chlorophyte *Elliptochloris marina* (Letsch et al., 2009) and the dinoflagellate *Symbiodinium muscatinei* (LaJeunesse and Trench, 2000). - @dimond2017\n\nThe *Symbiodinium muscatinei*[@lajeunesse2000a]were reclassified as *Breviolum muscatinei*\n\nMost anemones only host one symbiont, or the other.

Transplantation of *A. elegantissima* anemones with chlorophyte *E. marina* symbionts to warmer, higher-light environments results in shifts in the symbiont population from *E. marina* to *B. muscatinei* [@dimond2017].\n\nAnemones hosting *B. muscatinei* have a golden-brown color, while those that host *E. marina* are mossy green. Symbiont type can be verified by viewing excised tentacles under light microscopy, and commonly, no mixed-symbiont populations are observed [@dimond2017].\n\n![Figure 1 from the dissertation by Beck,
