Replicate numbers were chosen based on previous work in stony and octocorals and anemones (Brown et al., 1995; Hueerkamp et al., 2001; Hill and Scott, 2012; Hill et al., 2014; Pupier et al., 2018; Gierz et al., 2020).” (Steinberg et al., 2021, p. 3)\n>\n> “The number of Symbiodiniaceae cells was standardized to the total protein concentration of the supernatant. The dilution factor (DF) of the supernatant compared to the resuspended Symbiodiniaceae pellet must be considered when calculating Symbiodiniaceae concentrations. In this study, the supernatant had a volume of 40 ml and the resuspended Symbiodiniaceae had a volume of 5 ml, and as such the DF was 8. Symbiodiniaceae per ml was calculated using the following formula: count ×dilution 6.25 ×10−6 , where 6.25 × 10−6 is the volume of one haemocytometer grid square. Symbiodiniaceae per μg protein was calculated using the following formula: Symbiodiniceae ml DF ×protein( μg ml ) or count ×dilution 6.25 ×10−6 DF ×protein ( μg ml ).” (Steinberg et al., 2021, p. 3)\n\n## Chlorophyll extraction\n\n-   vortex the remaining contents of the Chlorophyll tube to re-suspend the symbionts\n-   centrifuge for 10 minutes at 800 xg\n-   remove supernatent & discard\n-   add 5mL of 100% acetone\n-   vortex to re-suspend symbiont pellet\n-   incubate tubes in the dark at $4^{\\circ}C$ for 48 hours[^7]\n\n[^7]: In the paper Steinberg et al., 2021, they compared a 24hr and a 48hr Chlorophyll extraction incubation period... they found that 24hrs was perfectly fine for Chl-a extraction, but that 48hrs was better for Chl-c2 extraction.

Each haemocytometer fill was considered a technical replicate, while the squares counted within the grid were considered a sub-replicate. Six technical replicates and 5 sub-replicates per technical replicate were performed, for a total of 30 replicates. Replicate numbers were chosen based on previous work in stony and octocorals and anemones (Brown et al., 1995; Hueerkamp et al., 2001; Hill and Scott, 2012; Hill et al., 2014; Pupier et al., 2018; Gierz et al., 2020).” (Steinberg et al., 2021, p. 3)\n>\n> “The number of Symbiodiniaceae cells was standardized to the total protein concentration of the supernatant. The dilution factor (DF) of the supernatant compared to the resuspended Symbiodiniaceae pellet must be considered when calculating Symbiodiniaceae concentrations. In this study, the supernatant had a volume of 40 ml and the resuspended Symbiodiniaceae had a volume of 5 ml, and as such the DF was 8. Symbiodiniaceae per ml was calculated using the following formula: count ×dilution 6.25 ×10−6 , where 6.25 × 10−6 is the volume of one haemocytometer grid square. Symbiodiniaceae per μg protein was calculated using the following formula: Symbiodiniceae ml DF ×protein( μg ml ) or count ×dilution 6.25 ×10−6 DF ×protein ( μg ml ).” (Steinberg et al., 2021, p. 3)\n\n## Chlorophyll extraction\n\n-   vortex the remaining contents of the Chlorophyll tube to re-suspend the symbionts\n-   centrifuge for 10 minutes at 800 xg\n-   remove supernatent & discard\n-   add 5mL of 100% acetone\n-   vortex to re-suspend symbiont pellet\n-   incubate tubes in the dark at $4^{\\circ}C$ for 48 hours[^7]\n\n[^7]: In the paper Steinberg et al., 2021, they compared a 24hr and a 48hr Chlorophyll extraction incubation period... they found that 24hrs was perfectly fine for Chl-a extraction, but that 48hrs was better for Chl-c2 extraction.

Open the NanoDrop 2000c desktop application\n2.  Click on the \"Method Editor\" button\n\n![](01_method-editor.PNG)\n\n2.  Name and describe the custom measurement method. Here, select `Manually enetered factor / extinction coefficient` for the `Method type`. Click `Next`.![](02_name-type.PNG)\n\n3.  In this window type in the analysis wavelength in nanometers (nm) that you want to measure. Here we want to measure 630, 663, and 750. We want the extinction coefficient to be from @jeffrey1975 table 2:\n\n![](jeffery_table2.png)\n\nHowever, the extinction coefficients for 100% acetone are different for each type of chlorophyll... If I want to measure both chlorophyll a and c2, does this mean I need a different method for each one?\n\n![](03_measurement.PNG)\n\n4.  Correction for analysis wavelength should be 750 nm *and* a baseline correction of 750 nm. Click `Next`.\n\n![](04_correction.PNG)\n\n5.  Optionally enter a formula table. Here I just want to absorbance at each of the following wavelengths: 630, 663, and 750. Click `Next`.\n\n![](05_formula-table.PNG)\n\n6.  In instrument settings select the wavelength measurement range to Visible range (350nm- 840nm). Also check the box next to `Auto pathlength` indicating that it should be 'On'. Click `Finish`.\n\n    ![](06_settings.PNG)\n\n7.  Load your blank cuvette...\n\n    ![](08_cuvette.PNG)\n\n### Measure cuvette blanks and samples\n\n6.  after the 48hr incubation, pull tubes out of the 4C fridge and centrifuge for 10 minutes at 805 RCF\n7.  transfer 2 2mL aliquots of extracted chlorophyll in acetone from each symbiont tube into two optical glass cuvettes\n8.  measure absorbance at 630, 663, and 750nm using the NanoDrop cuvettes\n\n# Calculate concentrations\n\n-   calculate concentrations of chlorophyll $a$ and $c_2$ in $\\mu g/mL$ using the following equations from [@jeffrey1975] Jeffery and Humphrey (1975) for dinoflagellates:\n\n    $$ Chlorophyll a = 11.43E_{663} − 0.64E_{630} $$ $$ Chlorophyll c2 = 27.09E_{630} − 3.63E_{663} $$\n\n> \" As 1 ml of resuspended Symbiodiniaceae pellet was extracted in 5 ml of acetone, chlorophyll concentrations were multiplied by five. To calculate chlorophyll per μg protein, the following equation was used: 5 × chlorophyll ( μg ml ) 8 ×protein ( μg ml ).\" (Steinberg et al., 2021, p.
