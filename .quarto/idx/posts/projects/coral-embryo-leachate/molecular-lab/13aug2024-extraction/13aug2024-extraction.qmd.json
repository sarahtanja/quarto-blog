I called Zymo and they suggested I try:\n\n        -   Adding more DNA/RNA Lysis Buffer & Mixing until supernatent is clear\n\n        -   Using BeadBashing Tubes to ensure Lysis\n\n        -   Trying PK Digestion without BeadBashing\n\nI ended up trying 3 different things:\n\nWith 123C9 I transferred the 500uL of sample in DNA/RNA Shield and DNA/RNA Lysis Buffer to the Qiagin Tissue Disrupter Tube & set it in the mortexer for 2 minutes. This created a clear supernatent, and didn't involve adding any DNA/RNA Lysis Buffer volume. The Qiagin Tissue Disrupteer is also a solid single bead, so I didn't need to worry about sucking up any tiny glass beads into the pipette when I did transfer the supernatent to the spin column.\n\nWith 123L9 I transferred the 500uL of sample in Shield and Lysis Buffer to the Zymo 0.1-0.5mm BeadBashing Lysis Tubes, & set in mortexer for 2 minutes, then centrifuged at 16,000xg for 1 minute. I then added 600uL more of DNA/RNA Lysis Buffer and centrifuged again at 16,000xg for 1 minute. I transferred 600uL of the cleared supernatent from each tube sequentially through the filter (being careful to leave \\~500uL of volume in the tube so as not to disrupt/suck up the tiny glass beads\n\nFor 123M9, I tried just increasing the DNA/RNA Lysis Buffer by 600uL and vortexing to see if that would clear up any debris. It didn't.. SO I split 1 bead bashing tube into each of the three microcentrifuge tubes and set it in the mortexer for 1 minute.\n\n---\\> Proceed to purification\n\n-   At this point, we have three cryovials for each spin column... each with varying volumes of sample. Sequentially transfer sample into yellow Spin-Away Filter in a Collection Tube and centrifuge for 30s at 16,000xg **SAVE THE FLOW THROUGH FOR RNA PURIFICATION**\n\n-   Doubled volume of 100% (200 proof) ethanol to the RNA flow through in a falcon tube and vortexed to mix\n\n-   Sequentially transfer RNA flow-through + ethanol in volumes =\\>700uL into the green Zymo Spin IIICG Column in a Collection Tube\n\n    ::: callout-warning\n    This was most difficult with the 123L9 and 123M9 samples because they had larger volumes to work with, meaning you have to pass it through the spin filter more, and there's more flow-through you have to save. The volume of the saved flow-through exceeded that of the collection tube, so I had to start saving the flow through in a 15mL falcon tube. After doubling with 200-proof ethanol, I ended up with \\~3mL for 123C9, \\~4mL for 123L9, and \\~5mL for 123M9 that all had to get passed through the RNA green spin column. This took awhile and was a bottle neck in the process...
