discard the flow-through\n\n-   Add 700uL of **`RNA Wash Buffer`** to each column and centrifuge at 16,000xg for 30s, then discard the flow-through\n\n-   Add 400uL of **`RNA Wash Buffer`** to each column and centrifuge at 16,000xg for 2mins to ensure complete removal of the wash buffer, then discard the flow-through\n\n-   Conduct a dry spin and centrifuge at 16,000xg for 2mins to ensure complete removal of the wash buffer prior to elution\n\n# Qubit Prep\n\n-   Transfer 1uL of each eluted & purified DNA/RNA sample to their respectively labelled Qubit assay tube, and keep on ice to continue work, or freeze in the -80C for later\n\n## End Products\n\nThe end products are:\n\n-   70ul of DNA in nuclease-free water\n\n-   1uL of DNA in nuclease-free water for Qubit\n\n-   60ul of RNA in nuclease-free water\n\n-   1uL of RNA in nuclease-free water for Qubit\n\nPlace these vials on ice and proceed with Nanodrop & Qubit quantification: - [Nanodrop Protocol]() - [Qubit RNA Broad Range Protocol]()\n\nOR, to continue lab-work later,\n\nPlace them in a wax freezer box, label the box, and freeze them in the -80C.\n"},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"kable","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":{"source":true,"toggle":true},"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":true,"link-external-newwindow":true,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","highlight-style":{"light":"github","dark":"github-dark"},"toc":true,"toc-depth":2,"reference-location":"margin","output-file":"embryo-extractions.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
