This experiment allowed embryos to develop from a bundle-bundle cross (meaning one egg-sperm bundle from one parent colony was placed in a 20mL scintillation vial with another egg-sperm bundle from a different parent colony). Colonies are not known to be able to self-fertilize... meaning it's important that each bundle came from a different parent colony. Each *Montipora capitata* egg sperm bundle contains a 'bundle' of eggs that are bound together around a 'packet' of sperm.\n\nEach egg-sperm bundle contains 15 +/- 5.1 oocytes (mean +/- SD, n = 214, from 26 colonies) [@padilla-gamino2011]\n\n::: callout-note\nThis means that each bundle-bundle cross, if there was 100% fertilization success, should result in anywhere from \\~18 to \\~42 maturing embryos.\n\nQuestion \\# 1: Do we use 100% fertilization success as our 'baseline' to compare all treatment groups (including the control?). This could provide insight into fertilization success ratios for bundle-bundle cross experiments, but may not be applicable to oceanic conditions, where there is sperm competition, mixing, and greater potential for dilution\n\nAnswer: We will only assess fertilization success at the point of cleavage, where presumably, we will still see the unfertilized oocytes (any eggs that have not cleaved). In the prawn chip and early gastrula phases, the unfertilized eggs have already dissolved. In these phases, we will assess embryo mortality based on the fertilization rates we find from the cleavage data.\n:::\n\n\n# Prawn chip\n\n![2x Nikon scope image of sample 8M9 \\| cross 8, Mid PVC treatment 0.1mg/L, 9 hours post fertilization (prawn chip phase)](8M9_stitch_001_crop_r90.png)\n\n# Early gastrula\n\n![4x Nikon scope image of sample 6L14 (cross 6, Low PVC treatment 0.01mg/L, 14 hours post fertilization (early gastrula phase))](6L14_stitch_001.png)\n\n::: callout-note\nQuestion #2: How should we treat fragmented embryos?
