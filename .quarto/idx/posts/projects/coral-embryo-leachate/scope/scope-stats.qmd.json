This experiment allowed embryos to develop from a bundle-bundle cross (meaning one egg-sperm bundle from one parent colony was placed in a 20mL scintillation vial with another egg-sperm bundle from a different parent colony). Colonies are not known to be able to self-fertilize... meaning it's important that each bundle came from a different parent colony. Each *Montipora capitata* egg sperm bundle contains a 'bundle' of eggs that are bound together around a 'packet' of sperm.\n\n::: callout-note\nEach egg-sperm bundle contains 15 +/- 5.1 oocytes (mean +/- SD, n = 214, from 26 colonies) [@padilla-gamino2011]\n:::\n\nThis means that each bundle-bundle cross, if there was 100% fertilization success, could result in 18 - 42 maturing embryos.\n\nQuestion \\# 1: Do we use 100% fertilization success as our 'baseline' to compare all treatment groups (including the control?).

In the prawn chip and early gastrula phases, the unfertilized eggs have already dissolved. In these phases, we will assess embryo mortality based on the fertilization rates we find from the cleavage data.\n\nQuestion #2: How should we treat fragmented embryos? I can tell by the cell structure that they made it to a certain phase... but I can't tell how many fragments make up one whole embryo (count data). Should we count the fragmented embryos?

A beta regression model (formula=proportion∼cleavage stage+treatment+cleavage stage:treatment) was used to analyze differences in the proportion of cells at each cleavage stage and treatment using the betareg R package (v3.1-4; Cribari-Neto and Zeileis, 2010). Differences between cleavage stages and treatments were then computed using the joint_tests function from the emmeans R package (v1.4.4; <https://cran-r-project-org.offcampus.lib.washington.edu/package=emmeans>), which effectively runs the beta regression model as a type III ANOVA. Additionally, a one-way nested ANOVA analysis tested the effect of tank on embryo and planula size wherein tank ID was nested within treatment. After determining that tank effects were non-significant (*P*\\>0.05), one-way ANOVA analysis was used to test for the effect of treatment on fertilized embryo, gastrula and planula volume. *Post hoc* Tukey HSD tests were conducted when the effect of treatment was significant (*P*\\<0.05). Data were visually examined for normal distribution and equal variance. The dependent variable was square-root transformed for the gastrulation and planula life stages in order to meet statistical assumptions prior to ANOVA analysis. Data points for these life stages were back-transformed for visualization in Fig. 2.\"\n>\n\n\n\n# Counts or Proportions?\n\n-   Use **count data** for absolute occurrences when total possible events are not known or not relevant.\n\n-   Use **proportional data** for relative comparisons or when expressing rates or probabilities against a known total\n\n**Count data** is appropriate when measuring the actual number of occurrences (e.g., number of embryos observed, number of defects, visitors, or events). **Proportional data** should be used when expressing data as a ratio or fraction of a whole, typically representing the probability or relative frequency of an event (e.g., survival rate, percent of embryos surviving out of total).\n\n## When to Use Count Data\n\n-   When you are interested in the absolute frequency of events, such as the number of embryos at each timepoint or the number of samples with a certain outcome.\n\n-   When the key variable is inherently discrete, non-negative, and possibly skewed (e.g., counts often have a lot of zeros and/or high maximum values).\n\n-   Appropriate statistical tests/models: Poisson regression, negative binomial regression, or zero-inflated models if there are many zeros.\n\n## When to Use Proportional Data\n\n-   When you want to standardize results or compare groups differing in total size (e.g., expressing embryo survival as a proportion of initial embryos).\n\n-   Useful for outcomes where each observation represents a part of a whole, and comparisons across different sample sizes are essential.\n\n-   Appropriate statistical tests/models: Logistic regression, binomial models, or Z-tests for proportions.\n\n# Timing\n# Abnormalities\n# Survival \n\nIf you only have the **number of embryos observed at each timepoint** without knowing the initial total, you should analyze the apparent decline over time to estimate survival, using methods that compare counts between timepoints. In this case, the data represent **cross-sectional snapshots** of different samples at 4, 9, and 14 hours post-fertilization, each independent from one another. The appropriate analysis approach is to treat the observations at each timepoint as separate groups and compare them accordingly using methods for independent samples rather than longitudinal repeated measures.\n\n## Key Points for Independent Samples at Different Timepoints\n\n-   Each timepoint group is treated as an independent sample.\n\n-   Compare counts (or proportions if normalized) between groups using tests for independent samples like ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis for continuous/ratio data or Chi-square for count/frequency data.\n\n-   Avoid methods that explicitly model within-subject correlation since observations are independent across time points.\n\nThis means your analysis focuses on **comparing independent groups' counts or proportions over time**, rather than modeling within-sample trajectories.Since your samples at each timepoint are independent (not repeated measures of the same samples), your data are better treated as **independent cross-sectional groups** rather than longitudinal repeated measures.\n\nThis means that instead of modeling within-sample changes over time, you compare the observed embryo counts or survival proportions between independent groups at 4, 9, and 14 hours using statistical tests appropriate for independent samples, such as ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis for continuous data or Chi-square tests for counts/frequencies.\n\nThus, your analysis approach focuses on comparing independent groups rather than modeling longitudinal trajectories within subjects or samples. This aligns with the \"pre-post no control group\" design where different subjects are sampled at each timepoint.\n\n## Approach Overview\n\n## Structure Your Data\n\n-   For each sample, you have:\n\n    -   Time point (4, 9, or 14 hours post-fertilization)\n\n    -   Observed viable embryo count at that time\n\n-   **You can summarize the data by calculating the mean and variance of embryo counts at each timepoint.**\n\n## Comparing Embryo Counts Over Time\n\n-   Analyze how the **average count of viable embryos per sample** changes across timepoints.\n\n-   Calculate the proportionate change from one time point to the next:\n\n## Statistical Analysis\n\n-   If samples are independent at each timepoint, use one-way ANOVA or nonparametric tests like Kruskal-Wallis.\n\n-   To estimate \"survival,\" take the percentage decrease in embryo count between each timepoint as a proxy for mortality.\n\n## Visualization\n\n-   Create a plot showing the **mean embryo count per sample at each timepoint**.\n\n-   This will visualize survival (or mortality) dynamics for the groups over time.\n\n## Example Calculation\n\nLet's say you have the following average embryo counts per sample:\n\n-   4 hours: mean = 18 embryos\n\n-   9 hours: mean = 12 embryos\n\n-   14 hours: mean = 7 embryos\n\n**Survival proportion to 9 hours:** $12/18=0.67$(67%) \n**Survival proportion to 14 hours:** $7/18=0.39$(39%).\n\n## Important Notes\n\n-   Without initial counts, you can only describe relative survival between timepoints, not absolute survival from fertilization.\n\n-   Ensure consistency in sample handling to minimize bias.\n\n-   Interpret results as changes in observed counts, acknowledging the limitation of not measuring initial embryo numbers.\n\nThis method will allow for assessment of **relative survival dynamics** and how embryo counts decline over time.\n\n<https://www.perplexity.ai/search/i-have-a-dataset-of-120-sample-ixpZ9EBOSPS8XkQYWp8FDQ#1>\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n# Background\n\nWhat information can we get from looking at the *Montipora capitata* embryos that were exposed to varying levels of PVC leachate (High: 1mg/L, Mid: 0.1mg/L, Low: 0.01mg/L)?
