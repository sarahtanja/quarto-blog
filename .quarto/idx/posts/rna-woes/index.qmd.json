I started researching reverse transcriptase[^1] inhibitors and reaching out to the [Roberts](https://robertslab.github.io/resources/) and [Putnam](http://putnamlab.com/) Labs to ask for advice (recorded in this Roberts Lab [github issue](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/issues/1670)).\n\n[^1]: Reverse transcriptase is an enzyme that transcribes single-stranded RNA into complementary DNA (cDNA) during library prep for RNA sequencing.

And the RNA quality, measured by UT GSAF Bioanalyzer, is also good. The issue is that there is *something else* in the sample that is preventing the reverse transcriptase from generating the cDNA.\n\n## Assessing Purity\n\nNanodrop purity targets[^2]:\n\n[^2]: Check out [Assessing RNA quantity and purity with Nanodrop](https://toptipbio.com/the-nanodrop-results-explained/) by TopTipBio\n\n-   [^3]260/280 (protein purity) **1.80 - 2.00**\n\n-   260/230 (salts purity) **2.00 - 2.20**\n\n[^3]: 5 nucleotides have different 260:280 ratios:\n\n    -   Guanine: 1.15\n\n    -   Adenine: 4.50\n\n    -   Cytosine: 1.51\n\n    -   Uracil: 4.0\n\n    -   Thymine: 1.47\n\n    So RNA typically has a higher 260/280 ratio than DNA due to the higher 260/280 ratio of Uracil compared to Thymine\n\n#### ⚠️ Phenol Contamination may manifest in a 260/280 ratio greater than 2.00 !\n\n> \"**A 260/280 ratio greater than 2.0 does NOT indicate the presence of especially high quality DNA, it most often reflects residual contaminants, such as phenol.**\" -[@zotero-2042]\n>\n> \" ... samples with purity ratios that range from 1.8 to 2.0 are typically considered pure. **Although purity ratios are very useful and informative, they do not always provide a complete picture of sample purity.**\"\n>\n> \"Residual chemicals from nucleic acid extraction processes (such as **guanidine salts or phenol**) or cell components that co-extract with the nucleic acids (such as protein) **can** **artificially inflate the A260 value**.\"\n\n## Zymo OneStep PCR Inhibitor Removal Kit\n\nI first tried purifying sample RNA using the [Zymo OneStep PCR Inhibitor Removal Kit](https://www.zymoresearch.com/collections/onestep-pcr-inhibitor-removal-kits) on a subset of the samples.\n\n```{r load in data}\nnanodrop18AUG <- read_csv(\"nanodrop_18AUG23.csv\")\n```\n\nI followed the kit instructions, and assessed the samples for purity using a Nanodrop.\n\n![Nanodrop plot results](nanodrop_plot_03AUG23.jpg)\n\n:   *RNA Nanodrop absorbance plot after passing Zymo DNA/RNA Quick Miniprep Plus extracted RNA samples through the Zymo OneStep PCR Inhibitor Kit.

So... be suspicious when you see at 260/280 ratio higher than 2.0!\n:::\n\nThe Zymo rep responded with the following advice:\n\n> \"The guanidine salts in our DNA/RNA Shield and DNA/RNA Lysis Buffer could be the reason of increased A230. We see this happening most often when small impurities (e.g., cell debris, protein aggregation) were transferred from sample processing and got stuck on the column. They would absorb buffers and release them during elution. Ways to avoid this include increasing the amount of DNA/RNA Shield used during processing, reducing sample input, and transferring only a fraction of sample (e.g.,500 µl from 800 µl) from the BashingBead tube to avoid debris. You can also further purify your existing eluted samples with either the RNA Clean & Concentrator that is on the way to you, or by following the\"Liquids/Reaction Clean-up\" procedure included in the Appendices section Quick-DNA/RNA Miniprep Plus's protocol.\"\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Zymo RNA Clean & Concentrator Kit\n\nI next tried to purify the RNA with the Zymo RNA Clean & Concentrator Kit:\n\n![Nanodrop plot results](18aug23_drop_plot.jpg)\n\n:   *RNA Nanodrop absorbance plot after passing Zymo DNA/RNA Quick Miniprep Plus extracted RNA samples through the Zymo RNA Clean & Concentrator Kit.

It was discovered in the 1970's by David Baltimore and Howard Temin when studying retroviruses (checkout this [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=v9EL8V-6la4) for a brief history on reverse transcriptase, and this [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POEDYHKyYDk) for a brief explanation of how it is used to turn mRNA to cDNA).\n\nSo what did I find, and what does this mean for my samples?\n\nThe RNA quantity, measured by Qubit Fluorometer, is good. And the RNA quality, measured by UT GSAF Bioanalyzer, is also good. The issue is that there is *something else* in the sample that is preventing the reverse transcriptase from generating the cDNA.\n\n## Assessing Purity\n\nNanodrop purity targets[^2]:\n\n[^2]: Check out [Assessing RNA quantity and purity with Nanodrop](https://toptipbio.com/the-nanodrop-results-explained/) by TopTipBio\n\n-   [^3]260/280 (protein purity) **1.80 - 2.00**\n\n-   260/230 (salts purity) **2.00 - 2.20**\n\n[^3]: 5 nucleotides have different 260:280 ratios:\n\n    -   Guanine: 1.15\n\n    -   Adenine: 4.50\n\n    -   Cytosine: 1.51\n\n    -   Uracil: 4.0\n\n    -   Thymine: 1.47\n\n    So RNA typically has a higher 260/280 ratio than DNA due to the higher 260/280 ratio of Uracil compared to Thymine\n\n#### ⚠️ Phenol Contamination may manifest in a 260/280 ratio greater than 2.00 !\n\n> \"**A 260/280 ratio greater than 2.0 does NOT indicate the presence of especially high quality DNA, it most often reflects residual contaminants, such as phenol.**\" -[@zotero-2042]\n>\n> \" ... samples with purity ratios that range from 1.8 to 2.0 are typically considered pure. **Although purity ratios are very useful and informative, they do not always provide a complete picture of sample purity.**\"\n>\n> \"Residual chemicals from nucleic acid extraction processes (such as **guanidine salts or phenol**) or cell components that co-extract with the nucleic acids (such as protein) **can** **artificially inflate the A260 value**.\"\n\n## Zymo OneStep PCR Inhibitor Removal Kit\n\nI first tried purifying sample RNA using the [Zymo OneStep PCR Inhibitor Removal Kit](https://www.zymoresearch.com/collections/onestep-pcr-inhibitor-removal-kits) on a subset of the samples.\n\n```{r load in data}\nnanodrop18AUG <- read_csv(\"nanodrop_18AUG23.csv\")\n```\n\nI followed the kit instructions, and assessed the samples for purity using a Nanodrop.\n\n![Nanodrop plot results](nanodrop_plot_03AUG23.jpg)\n\n:   *RNA Nanodrop absorbance plot after passing Zymo DNA/RNA Quick Miniprep Plus extracted RNA samples through the Zymo OneStep PCR Inhibitor Kit.

Any 260/280 protein ratios OVER 2.0 may indicate contamination by phenols, which absorb between 280-300nm wavelengths. So... be suspicious when you see at 260/280 ratio higher than 2.0!\n:::\n\nThe Zymo rep responded with the following advice:\n\n> \"The guanidine salts in our DNA/RNA Shield and DNA/RNA Lysis Buffer could be the reason of increased A230. We see this happening most often when small impurities (e.g., cell debris, protein aggregation) were transferred from sample processing and got stuck on the column. They would absorb buffers and release them during elution. Ways to avoid this include increasing the amount of DNA/RNA Shield used during processing, reducing sample input, and transferring only a fraction of sample (e.g.,500 µl from 800 µl) from the BashingBead tube to avoid debris. You can also further purify your existing eluted samples with either the RNA Clean & Concentrator that is on the way to you, or by following the\"Liquids/Reaction Clean-up\" procedure included in the Appendices section Quick-DNA/RNA Miniprep Plus's protocol.\"\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Zymo RNA Clean & Concentrator Kit\n\nI next tried to purify the RNA with the Zymo RNA Clean & Concentrator Kit:\n\n![Nanodrop plot results](18aug23_drop_plot.jpg)\n\n:   *RNA Nanodrop absorbance plot after passing Zymo DNA/RNA Quick Miniprep Plus extracted RNA samples through the Zymo RNA Clean & Concentrator Kit.
