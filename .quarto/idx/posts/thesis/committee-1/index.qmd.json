This is embodied by the '[one health](https://www.cdc.gov/onehealth/index.html)' approach, which recognizes the connections between the health of people, animals, and the environment.\n\n![one-health](https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/980705/fmars-09-980705-HTML/image_m/fmars-09-980705-g001.jpg)*infographic sourced from [Morrison et al. 2022](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2022.980705/full)*\n\n::: {.callout-info appearance=\"minimal\" icon=\"false\"}\nMore about Sarah's background, research interests & motivations can be found in the [About](https://sarahtanja.github.io/quarto-blog/about.html) page.\n:::\n\n### Research Topic Background\n\n**The goal of my Master's thesis research is to gain insight into multiple-stressor interactions of warming oceans and plastic pollution on reef-building corals.**\n\nUnder a CMIP6 climate scenario, it is forecasted that more than 75% of coral reefs will experience *yearly severe bleaching* before 2070 due to thermal stress. However, hope for resilient corals exists. In a prolonged marine heatwave event on Kiritimati Atoll, the largest coral atoll in the world, 100% of the corals near chronic anthropogenic disturbances died, but in areas that were not already stressed, 90% of corals died. The 10% that survived after bleaching are hypothesized to have recovered due to lower baseline levels of stress and better water quality compared to corals near chronic anthropogenic stressors like pollution and overfishing (Claar et al. 2020).\n\n**Corals are threatened by global stressors, strategies for reducing local stressors may give corals an edge on survival**\n\nWhile coral coverage has declined since the 50s, petroleum-derived plastic production and subsequent environmental plastic pollution have rapidly increased. An estimated 8 million tons of plastic and their associated additives end up in the oceans every year, with unknown impacts to important coastal coral reef ecosystems. Plastics are emerging environmental pollutants of growing concern for coral reefs, and are the source of a suite of environmental contaminants and persistent organic pollutants posing unknown risks to human and ecosystem health (Rochman et al. 2019). Plastics are non-biodegradable, persisting in the environment for centuries. UV radiation and mechanical weathering cause them to become brittle and fragment into microplastics \\<5mm, and nanoplastics \\<1mm. As plastics weather mechanically, they also weather chemically by leaching additives not covalently bonded to the plastic polymer resins (Hahladakis et al. 2018).\n\n[![Figure 2. 'Weathering processes of poorly reversible plastic pollution in the environment.Weathering proceeds along two co-occurring and synergistic pathways offragmentation and release of chemicals, and biofouling and oxidation.' from Macleod et al. 2021](micro-wx.png)](https://www.science.org/doi/epdf/10.1126/science.abg5433)*Figure from [Macleod et al. 2021](https://www.science.org/doi/epdf/10.1126/science.abg5433)*\n\nThe most common plastic additives are a group of chemicals called plasticizers, also known as phthalates or phthalate acid esters (PAE). They are commonly added to PVC to increase flexibility and durability. Phthalates are known to mimic or interfere with hormones that control developmental, reproductive, and immune response in both humans and animals (Maqbool et al. 2016). Despite the presence of phthalates in 95% of tested coral samples (Montano et al. 2020), little is known about how phthalates interfere with coral physiology and reproduction. Previous research shows that plastic leachates experimentally added to plants, bacteria, and algae impair growth, reduce photosynthesis, and shift microbial communities in lab studies (Capolupo et al. 2020; O'Brien et al. 2022; Tetu et al. 2019).\n\n\\*\\* Plastic pollution, and associated PAE pollution,\n\nMarine heatwaves, plastic manufacturing, and coastal ocean plastic pollution are all predicted to increase (MacLeod et al. 2021; Oliver et al. 2021).\n\nAs discussed in Claar et al. (2020), the success of coral recovery after bleaching will depend on levels of chronic anthropogenic stressors like pollution.\n\nI propose to conduct a series of studies that expose coral gametes and coral colonies to the multiple stressors of phthalate pollution and ocean warming, and subsequently measure the physiological responses, holobiont community structure, and gene expression between treatments. {: .notice--info}\n\nThis proposed research aligns with the mission of the School of Aquatic and Fisheries Sciences at the University of Washington, which is to conduct multidisciplinary research and education in order to understand, conserve, and manage marine ecosystems.\n\n> *REFERENCES*\n>\n> Capolupo, Marco, Lisbet Sørensen, Kongalage Don Ranil Jayasena, Andy M.

This is embodied by the '[one health](https://www.cdc.gov/onehealth/index.html)' approach, which recognizes the connections between the health of people, animals, and the environment.\n\n![one-health](https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/980705/fmars-09-980705-HTML/image_m/fmars-09-980705-g001.jpg)*infographic sourced from [Morrison et al. 2022](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2022.980705/full)*\n\n::: {.callout-info appearance=\"minimal\" icon=\"false\"}\nMore about Sarah's background, research interests & motivations can be found in the [About](https://sarahtanja.github.io/quarto-blog/about.html) page.\n:::\n\n### Research Topic Background\n\n**The goal of my Master's thesis research is to gain insight into multiple-stressor interactions of warming oceans and plastic pollution on reef-building corals.**\n\nUnder a CMIP6 climate scenario, it is forecasted that more than 75% of coral reefs will experience *yearly severe bleaching* before 2070 due to thermal stress. However, hope for resilient corals exists. In a prolonged marine heatwave event on Kiritimati Atoll, the largest coral atoll in the world, 100% of the corals near chronic anthropogenic disturbances died, but in areas that were not already stressed, 90% of corals died. The 10% that survived after bleaching are hypothesized to have recovered due to lower baseline levels of stress and better water quality compared to corals near chronic anthropogenic stressors like pollution and overfishing (Claar et al. 2020).\n\n**Corals are threatened by global stressors, strategies for reducing local stressors may give corals an edge on survival**\n\nWhile coral coverage has declined since the 50s, petroleum-derived plastic production and subsequent environmental plastic pollution have rapidly increased. An estimated 8 million tons of plastic and their associated additives end up in the oceans every year, with unknown impacts to important coastal coral reef ecosystems. Plastics are emerging environmental pollutants of growing concern for coral reefs, and are the source of a suite of environmental contaminants and persistent organic pollutants posing unknown risks to human and ecosystem health (Rochman et al. 2019). Plastics are non-biodegradable, persisting in the environment for centuries. UV radiation and mechanical weathering cause them to become brittle and fragment into microplastics \\<5mm, and nanoplastics \\<1mm. As plastics weather mechanically, they also weather chemically by leaching additives not covalently bonded to the plastic polymer resins (Hahladakis et al. 2018).\n\n[![Figure 2. 'Weathering processes of poorly reversible plastic pollution in the environment.Weathering proceeds along two co-occurring and synergistic pathways offragmentation and release of chemicals, and biofouling and oxidation.' from Macleod et al. 2021](micro-wx.png)](https://www.science.org/doi/epdf/10.1126/science.abg5433)*Figure from [Macleod et al. 2021](https://www.science.org/doi/epdf/10.1126/science.abg5433)*\n\nThe most common plastic additives are a group of chemicals called plasticizers, also known as phthalates or phthalate acid esters (PAE). They are commonly added to PVC to increase flexibility and durability. Phthalates are known to mimic or interfere with hormones that control developmental, reproductive, and immune response in both humans and animals (Maqbool et al. 2016). Despite the presence of phthalates in 95% of tested coral samples (Montano et al. 2020), little is known about how phthalates interfere with coral physiology and reproduction. Previous research shows that plastic leachates experimentally added to plants, bacteria, and algae impair growth, reduce photosynthesis, and shift microbial communities in lab studies (Capolupo et al. 2020; O'Brien et al. 2022; Tetu et al. 2019).\n\n\\*\\* Plastic pollution, and associated PAE pollution,\n\nMarine heatwaves, plastic manufacturing, and coastal ocean plastic pollution are all predicted to increase (MacLeod et al. 2021; Oliver et al. 2021).\n\nAs discussed in Claar et al. (2020), the success of coral recovery after bleaching will depend on levels of chronic anthropogenic stressors like pollution.\n\nI propose to conduct a series of studies that expose coral gametes and coral colonies to the multiple stressors of phthalate pollution and ocean warming, and subsequently measure the physiological responses, holobiont community structure, and gene expression between treatments. {: .notice--info}\n\nThis proposed research aligns with the mission of the School of Aquatic and Fisheries Sciences at the University of Washington, which is to conduct multidisciplinary research and education in order to understand, conserve, and manage marine ecosystems.\n\n> *REFERENCES*\n>\n> Capolupo, Marco, Lisbet Sørensen, Kongalage Don Ranil Jayasena, Andy M.

Of interest is the non-monotonic response (very low PAE concentrations significantly reduced proportion of eggs making it to initial cleavage, and were not significantly different compared to very high concentrations of PAE)*\n\n**In Summary:** the PAE-DEVO experiment resulted in a total of 15 samples, with an n=3, and showed significant differences between the control and all treatment groups. This pilot study may be a candidate for publication as a note in a low-impact factor journal like {: .notice--success}\n\n**Limitations:** Sample size is low and study replication is difficult because it relies on access to intact *M. capitata* egg-sperm bundles, and the use of [EPA 506 phthalate esters mix 1](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/product/supelco/48223?gclid=CjwKCAjw-8qVBhANEiwAfjXLrp8fD-G8yiB_NyrA3OLy3r2jdylgBmHVPUfGFnMp4CMfuVwePGi1dxoCBQIQAvD_BwE), which may pose harm to researcher health. If I were to repeat this experiment I would want to make my own leachate out of a common plastic consumer product, similar to the methods used by Tetu et al. 2019. Though this would be safer, it would not provide insight into the actual concentration of PAEs in the treatment. {: .notice--warning}\n\n***Note:** I presented this pilot study in a 5-min lighting talk during the AU'22 SAFS Graduate Student Symposium* {: .notice--info}\n\n#### PAE-TEMP \\| *M. capitata* Acute Phthalate & Thermal Stress Exposure\n\n![pae-temp-graphical-methods](graphical-methods.png)*graphical methods, JPG suggested simplifying diagram*\n\n**In Summary:** the PAE-TEMP experiment resulted in a total of 130 samples, with an n=10, that were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and can be used for DNA/RNA studies. {: .notice--success}\n\n**Limitations:** In order to ensure the phthalate concentration was controlled in each treatment, the 20mL scintillation vials were a closed, 'mesocosm', and the corals did not receive water changes during the short 48hr exposure. Because of this, I expect we will see degradation between the environmental and experimental control samples. This study can't account for the fact that corals in Kaneohe Bay may already be exposed to chronic low-levels of PAE pollution, so we can't say our control baseline is 'zero PAE exposure'. Replication may be difficult because it relies on the use of [EPA 506 phthalate esters mix 1](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/product/supelco/48223?gclid=CjwKCAjw-8qVBhANEiwAfjXLrp8fD-G8yiB_NyrA3OLy3r2jdylgBmHVPUfGFnMp4CMfuVwePGi1dxoCBQIQAvD_BwE), which may pose harm to researcher health. {: .notice--warning}\n\n## 3. Thesis Direction\n\nOf the two pilot experiments, the *M. capitata* Acute Phthalate & Thermal Stress Exposure (PAE-TEMP) provides the most samples and potential to move toward publishable manuscripts.\n\n### Chapter 1 - Microbiome\n\n::: {.notice--info markdown=\"1\"}\n**Acute phthalate and thermal stress exposure effects on *M. capitata* coral microbiome**\\\n- submit as a manuscript to [Environmental Pollution](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/environmental-pollution) (IF 9.988) - author list (Tanja, SS; Roberts, SB; Zaneveld, JR; Padilla-Gamiño, JL)\n:::\n\n::: {.notice--warning markdown=\"1\"}\n**Hypothesis:** Are there any microbes that may be more sensible to temp, PAE or the combination of both? - \"elevated temperatures make corals more vulnerable to opportunistic bacteria\"-[Zaneveld et al. 2016](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms11833) - \"Overall, coral microbiome diversity and composition varied with host species, local disturbance and heat stress, but not always as predicted.\"-[McDevitt-Irwin et al 2019](https://link-springer-com.offcampus.lib.washington.edu/article/10.1007/s00338-019-01779-8#Sec7) - \"Both heat stress exposures induced the significant structural reorganization of coral-associated bacteria, with bacterial diversity and community heterogeneity significantly increasing with the temperature treatment.\"- [Zhu et al. 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0141113623000284)\n:::\n\n**Methods:**\n\n-   [Quick DNA/RNA Miniprep Plus Kit](https://www.zymoresearch.com/products/quick-dna-rna-miniprep-plus-kit)\n    -   50 preps \\$438.90 , 10 preps \\$106.70\n-   16S rRNA amplicon sequencing *send subsample of control vs. overdose to look for initial differences*\n    -   UW Northwest Genomics Center \\$\\_\\_/sample\n    -   Azenta\n    -   Univ. of Texas\n    -   [Mr. DNA Lab](https://www.mrdnalab.com/16s-ribosomal-sequencing.html) \\$90/sample for 5k sequences per assay\n-   QIIME pipeline\n\n### Chapter 2 - Transcriptome\n\n::: {.notice--info markdown=\"1\"}\n**Acute phthalate and thermal stress exposure effects on *M. capitata* coral transcriptome** - submit as a manuscript to [Environmental Pollution](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/environmental-pollution) (IF 9.988) - author list (Tanja, SS; Roberts, SB; Zaneveld, JR; Padilla-Gamiño, JL)\n:::\n\n::: {.notice--warning markdown=\"1\"}\n**Hypothesis:** \"What genes do you expect to be upregulated or downregulated by temp, PAE, and temp and PAE? and why?\" - [\"Endocrine-like signaling in corals\"](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118828502.ch9) , book chapter by Ann Tarrant - \"components of the transcriptome were significantly upregulated within 90 min and after a temperature increase of +2 degrees C.

Feedback\n\nQ. Is the PAE + Temp multiple stressor study rigorous enough to be turned into two manuscripts? A. potentially, it will depend on what we see in the data. It will be enough for two thesis chapters.\n\nQ. Which sequencing strategy would be best suited to this project? - Where have you sent samples for sequencing services in the past? - What are reasonable sequencing costs per sample?\n\nQ. I need support/resources to learn about: - requesting quotes for sequencing (sequencing platform, \\# of sequences, \\# of bp, read-length/assay-length) - [library preparation](https://www.idtdna.com/pages/technology/next-generation-sequencing/library-preparation#:~:text=Library%20preparation%20is%20the%20first,and%20tagmentation%2Dbased%20library%20prep.)\n\n```         \n  > “sequencing libraries are pools of DNA fragments containing adapter sequences compatible with a specific sequencing platform and indexing barcodes for individual sample identification. The main library preparation methods are [ligation-based library preparation](https://www.idtdna.com/pages/technology/next-generation-sequencing/library-preparation/ligation-based-library-prep) tagmentation-based library preparation, and [amplicon library preparation](https://www.idtdna.com/pages/technology/next-generation-sequencing/dna-sequencing/targeted-sequencing/amplicon-sequencing). The specific protocol you choose depends on your sequencing platform and downstream analysis.”\n\n- large file storage (Hyak super computer at SAFS?) *got stuck at this step when working with
