They are commonly added to consumer products. Lower molecular weight phthalates are primarily used as solvents in cosmetics while higher molecular weight phthalates are added to plastics like polyvinyl chloride (PVC) to increase flexibility.\n\n> \"Plasticizers work by reducing the chemical affinity between molecules when embedded between chains of plastic raw materials (or act as monomers in polycarbonate plastic), but as plasticizers are not especially stable in these products, they can leach out and thus end up in the environment.

Francesco Saliu suggested we focus on water soluble phthalates in our experimental design so that we don't have to mess with a carrier solvent control, but can still control the treatments to be within a range of environmental relevance. However, I just learned that \"Low molecular weight PAEs such as dimethyl phthalate (DMP), diethyl phthalate (DEP), and DnBP are components of industrial solvents, solvents in perfumes, adhesives, waxes, inks, pharmaceutical products, insecticide materials, and cosmetics [@net2015]\" and that PAEs with longer alkyl chains are used as plasticizers. Since I want to tie my work into marine plastic pollution, I should really focus on common phthalates added to plastics. Unfortunately, it looks like using a water soluble PAE may not be an option.\n\nIn the table from @net2015, water solubility (S~w^25^~ ) indicates solubility in mg/L at 25$^\\circ$C.
