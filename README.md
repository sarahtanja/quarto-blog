# Sarah Tanja's Open Lab Notebook

This is a Quarto-based website serving as an open lab notebook for research on marine biology, plastic pollution, and climate impacts on coastal primary producers.

## Overview

This repository contains the source code for [Sarah Tanja's Open Lab Notebook](https://sarahtanja.github.io/quarto-blog/), built with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/).

## Research Focus

The research documented in this lab notebook explores:

- 🌊 Multiple stressor impacts of microplastic-associated pollution and heat stress on coastal primary producers
- 🪸 Effects on scleractinian corals, sea anemones, kelps, and seaweeds
- 🧬 Microbiome alterations and gene expression changes
- 🔬 Photosynthetic efficiency in marine organisms

**Central Question:** *"Does pollution undermine climate resilience?"*
