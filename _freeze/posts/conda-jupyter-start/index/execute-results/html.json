As I start working on analyzing my microbiome data, I need to have a workspace that has conda and can run QIIME2 in a jupyter notebook.\n\nI started by following the [QIIME2 Install Instructions](https://docs.qiime2.org/2023.5/install/native/) for a native install on a Windows Subsystem for Linux.\n\nSSH into the Roberts Lab raven server by:\n\n```{r. engine='bash'}\nssh stanja@172.25.149.12\n```\n...and then enter the user password and press enter.\n\nThe following is the command to start the conda shell on the Roberts Lab raven server:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\neval \"$(/opt/anaconda/anaconda3/bin/conda shell.bash hook)\"\n```\n\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n/bin/bash: /opt/anaconda/anaconda3/bin/conda: No such file or directory\n```\n:::\n:::\n",
