We also talked a bit about stats and need to follow up with what to do when your data is not normally distributed (moving from paired T test to Wilcoxon paired-sample T test)\n-   Tried using `quarto publish gh-pages` command to publish blog\n\n##### 19-MAY-2023. F\n\n-   Ran Qubit on ex7 samples\n-   Extraction #7 (the redo) on samples:\n    -   3-Eb\n    -   3-PH1b\n    -   2-PA2b\n    -   2-CH1b\n    -   4-PH1b\n    -   3-CA1b\n-   found out how to use quarto to do [Margin References](https://quarto.org/docs/blog/posts/2022-02-17-advanced-layout/#:~:text=.-,Margin%20References,-Footnotes%20and%20the)!\n-   found cool article on [Verbatim code chunks](https://themockup.blog/posts/2021-08-27-displaying-verbatim-code-chunks-in-xaringan-presentations/) in R (want to render the code chunk options and show what engine is being used?)\n-   dry-ice at biochem stockroom is low, have to check that there will be a replenishment next week so I have enough dry ice to ship samples!\n\n##### 18-MAY-2023. W\n\n-   wrote script to normalize eluted RNA/DNA\n\n##### 04-MAY-2023. W\n\n-   received Qubit DNA Broad Range (BR) Assay Kit!\n-   Gotta get P2 DNA/RNA free tips!\n-   ran qubit on DNA & RNA, got great results!\n\n## April 2023\n\n##### 25-APR-2023. T\n\n-   sorted pipettes with Callum\n-   submitted Bioinformatics Assignment\n-   ordered Qubit DNA BR assay kit\n-   ordered film sealing plate roller\n\n##### 24-APR-2023. M\n\n-   sent draft letter for NAH experiential learning fund to JPG on Monday April 24th\n\n-   found [96-well PCR shipping guide](https://microbe.med.umich.edu/sites/default/files/downloads/2021_ConsolidatedShippingGuide_0.pdf)\n\n-   emailed Mr.DNA about 20 16S samples\n\n-   read up on NanoDrop vs. Qubit\n\n-   reached out to Sam White about Ubuntu/Windows dual-boot computer in lab 236, which is connected to the Thermo NanoDrop 2000c Sam shared:\n\n    > FYI, if you're solely using the NanoDrop for quantification (i.e. not worried about 260/280), then I'd highly recommend just relying on the Qubit, with both DNA and RNA. The reason for this is that the NanoDrop will almost always over-\"calculate\" your sample concentrations (both RNA and DNA). The reason for this is that the NanoDrop is a spectrophotometer and measures light absorbance. With almost all DNA/RNA isolations, there will be residual DNA or RNA in your sample. The NanoDrop cannot distinguish between the two molecules, because they're both made up of the same material; nucleotides. Nucleotides, regardless of their of their origin will absorb light at an average wavelength of 260nm.Since the Qubit assays use molecule-specific dyes, the dye will only bind to DNA or only to RNA. The dyes will not bind to any carryover of other types of molecules in the sample, so the accuracy (and sensitivity) is much, much higher than the NanoDrop.\n\n##### 21-APR-2023. F\n\n-   met with JPG April 1on1\n    -   talked about travel from Sept. 12 - Oct 9th, missing first 2 weeks of Autumn '23 quarter, focusing that quarter on writing & analysis\n    -   GOAL: have all sequences (16S & Transcriptomes) by September 1st 2023\n    -   Initial 20 samples extracted & sent for sequencing before FHL\n    -   2nd committee meeting to be held once initial 20 samples are run through 1st analysis for 16S & DGE, get advice on strategy for selecting remaining samples\n    -   Follow-up samples extracted & sent for sequencing in July/August\n    -   Send draft letter for NAH experiential learning fund to JPG on Monday April 24th\n-   Initial test round 2 samples extracted!!!\n    -   3-CA1a\n    -   3-Ea\n        -   Sampes selected from [extr1](https://github.com/sarahtanja/coral-DNA-RNA-lab-extractions/blob/main/rand-sample-processing.Rmd) using a random number generator\n        -   details can be found in the [coral-DNA-RNA-lab-extractions](https://github.com/sarahtanja/coral-DNA-RNA-lab-extractions) repository\n\n##### 20-APR-2023.

Instead of downloading the full data set you could just pick like three lifestages for a test comparison - AH\n\n##### 10-APR-2023. M\n\n-   created script to randomize sample processing in [coral-DNA-RNA-lab-extractions](https://github.com/sarahtanja/coral-DNA-RNA-lab-extractions) repo\n-   called Zymo and learned that 'mix' in protocol step can either mean pipette up and down 10-12 times, or briefly touch to vortex mixer for a pulse\n-   Zymo tech also shared that it's best to follow protocol and add Lysis buffer to the sample supernatent in a separate rnase-free tube. If you do it in the filter tube some sample may start to percolate thru the filter before being fully buffered.\n-   [Horizontal Microtube Holder](https://www.zymoresearch.com/products/horizontal-microtube-holder)\n\n## March 2023\n\n##### 29-MAR-2023.

During the transition period, there will be some disruptions to normal operations, and the continuity of research and teaching and minimizing the impact on faculty, staff, and students is the priority. There will be Restrictive Periods during which no one will be able to process purchase orders or obtain reimbursements in ARIBA. Exceptions may be made for urgent or emergency purchases. Travel reimbursements and non-travel-related reimbursements should be submitted before June 9th, and processing will resume on July 5th. Blanket Purchase Orders that are expected to be active past June 30th, 2023, will not be automatically transferred to Workday, and all continuing BPOs must be manually reentered by the College of the Environment. Navigating the transition will require patience and close partnerships between research and administrative groups\n\n        -   space survey\n\n            -   \\% of time spent in spaces from July '22 - March '23\n            -   2% 242\n            -   8% 236\n            -   30% HIMB\n            -   60% 264, 264B\n            -   undergrad Nora Hessen 2hrs per week in 264, 264B since January '23\n\n##### 28-MAR-2023.

This is the beginning of my exploration of using GitHub to jot down thoughts, record 'daily bits', and organize the procedures and methods I'll use in my thesis research\n\n-   [zbengt](https://github.com/zbengt) introduced me to '[elicit](https://elicit.org/)', a lit review search AI. I searched \"What is the role of endocrine signaling in cnidarian development\" and found an exciting paper titled [**\"Sea Anemones Responding to Sex Hormones, Oxybenzone, and Benzyl Butyl Phthalate: Transcriptional Profiling and *in Silico* Modelling Provide Clues to Decipher Endocrine Disruption in Cnidarians\"**](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fgene.2021.793306/full) authored by Morgan et al. in 2022\n\n-   I explored another AI, [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/), and gave it the prompt \"write me a poem about corals and oysters and mothers\" and it returned:\n\n    -   \n\n        > Coral reefs, a vibrant sea of life, A home for countless creatures, rife. Oysters, clams, and mussels too, All nestled safe, their shells in view.\n        >\n        > But danger lurks, the waters warm, The coral bleaches, it's colors torn. Mother Nature's wrath, a sight to see, But we can help, if only we believe.\n        >\n        > For mothers, fierce and loving beasts, Will do what it takes, to protect at least. Their young and home, with all their might, They'll fight and strive, through day and night.\n        >\n        > So let us join, in their noble quest, To save the reefs, and all the rest. For oysters, corals, and mothers too, Deserve a chance, to make it through.\n\n-   I followed up with a ChatGPT prompt \"what are examples of endocrine signaling in cnidarians?\" and it returned:\n\n    -   \n\n        > Endocrine signaling is the process of communicating information from one cell to another by releasing hormones into the circulatory system or through direct contact. In cnidarians, endocrine signaling can be used for a variety of functions, including the regulation of growth, development, and behavior.\n        >\n        > One example of endocrine signaling in cnidarians is the release of growth hormones, which stimulate the growth and development of cells and tissues. For example, in some species of cnidarians, the release of growth hormones is regulated by the action of a hormone called insulin-like growth factor (IGF).\n        >\n        > Another example of endocrine signaling in cnidarians is the regulation of reproductive function. In some species of cnidarians, hormones called gonadotropins are released by the endocrine cells of the gonads (sex organs) to stimulate the production and release of gametes (sex cells).\n        >\n        > Endocrine signaling is also involved in the regulation of behavior in cnidarians. For example, some species of cnidarians release hormones called neuropeptides that act on the nervous system to regulate behaviors such as feeding, movement, and response to stimuli.\n        >\n        > Overall, endocrine signaling plays a vital role in the regulation of various functions in cnidarians, including growth, development, and behavior.\n\nâ\\*\\*Is this is all true!? I'll have to follow-up with my own dive into primary literature...\n\n-   Another ChatGPT AI response, when asked the same questions, but prompted to provide references:\n\n    -   \n\n        > Examples of endocrine signaling in cnidarians include the release of hormones in response to stimuli such as touch, temperature changes, and changes in light intensity.\n        >\n        > For example, the hormone adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (ACAP) is released from cnidocytes in response to a variety of stimuli and activates adenylate cyclase, leading to the production of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and the regulation of various physiological processes.\n        >\n        > Other signaling molecules that have been identified in cnidarians include cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), inositol triphosphate (IP3), and Ca2+-dependent signaling pathways.\n        >\n        > References:\n        >\n        > Levitan, D.
