The main difference was I re-introduced Proteinase K digestion (hoping to maintain RNA quality & integrity... But RNA quantity suffered A LOT (And I'm not measuring RIN... just crossing my fingers and sending it to Azenta)\n:::\n\n# Extraction Notes\n\ndate: 15-AUG-2024\n\nkit: Zymo Quick-DNA/RNA Miniprep Plus Kit\n\n-   Thaw samples to room temp\n\n-   Vortex to mix\n\n-   Transfer to Qiagin Tissue Disruption Tube\n\n-   Homogenize for 2 minutes\n\n-   Centrifuge 1 minute to get rid of bubbles\n\n    -   Checked for complete lysis... still saw entact cells so I homogenized again for 1 minute with 1/3 of Zymo 0.1 & 0.5 mm glass beads poured in each tube. This resulted in complete lysis. Centrifuged again for 1 minute\n\n-   Split into two aliquots of 500uL & transfered to two new nuclease-free tubes\n\n-   Proteinase K Digestion for 40 minutes at 55C\n\n-   Added 700uL of DNA/RNA Lysis Buffer to each tube ( a total of 1400uL volume in each tube )\n\n-   Vortex to mix for 5 seconds\n\n-   Check to see that embryos have dissolved and liquid is clear\n\n---\\> Proceed to purification\n\n-   Sequentially transfer 2800uL of each sample in aliquots of 700uL into yellow Spin-Away Filter in a Collection Tube and centrifuge for 30s. **SAVE THE FLOW THROUGH FOR RNA PURIFICATION by tipping flow through into falcon tube**\n\n-   Doubled volume of 100% (200 proof) ethanol to the RNA flow through in a falcon tube and vortexed to mix. End volume of flow through + ethanol = 5mL\n\n-   Sequentially transfer RNA flow-through + ethanol in volumes =\\>700uL into the green Zymo Spin IIICG Column in a Collection Tube\n\n-   Saved 1st 1400uL for protein\n\n    ::: callout-warning\n    This took 7 passes!\n    :::\n\n-   Performed DNase I Treatment on green RNA spin column\n\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    \n    ```{.r .cell-code}\n    DB = 75*4\n    print(DB)\n    ```\n    \n    ::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n    ```\n    [1] 300\n    ```\n    :::\n    \n    ```{.r .cell-code}\n    Dnase = 5*4 \n    print(Dnase)\n    ```\n    \n    ::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n    ```\n    [1] 20\n    ```\n    :::\n    :::\n\n\n    -   I didn't invert to mix... I always lose some volume 'beads' in the lid when I do this. Instead I flicked the tube to mix it and kept all the volume down in the cnical end of the tube. This worked well and I had a full 80uL of treatment per spin column to work with.\n\n-   Warmed Zymo DNase-RNase Free Water to 55C in heat block before elution, and slowly dripped water directly over filter.\n\neluted DNA volume: 30uL in `Zymo DNase-RNase Free Water`\n\neluted RNA volume: 30uL in `Zymo DNase-RNase Free Water`\n\n::: callout-important\nI spoke with Azenta rep on morning of 15-Aug-2024 and learned that they don't require a Nanodrop quality check, just a Qubit double-stranded quantity measurement by flourescence. The target is 100ng of total RNA, in a minimum of 20uL of buffer. So from here on out I'm just checking quantity using the Qubit and the Invitrogen High Sensitivity (HS) RNA assay.\n:::\n\n# Qubit\n\nUsing the Invitrogen Thermo Fischer RNA High Sensitivity Assay Kit.\n\nPrepared working solution for 3 samples and two standards:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n199*6\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 1194\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nQubit RNA HS reagent in DMSO = 1uL \\* 5 = 6uL\n\nQubit RNA HS Buffer = 199uL \\* 5 = 1194uL\n\n### RNA\n\nstandard 1: 94.63\n\nstandard 2: 1803.97\n\nRunID: 2024-08-16_074027\n\n| sample_id | qubit_rna_1 | qubit_rna_2 |\n|-----------|-------------|-------------|\n| 45C14     | 8.70 ng/uL  | 8.88 ng/uL  |\n| 456L4     | too low     | too low     |\n| 456M9     | too low     | too low     |\n| 456H4     | too low     | too low     |\n| 45C9      | too low     | too low     |\n| 456L9     | 8.34 ng/uL  | 8.22 ng/uL  |\n\n# Storage Location\n\nRNA samples are stored in -80C 'JPG Lab' Thermo freezer on shelf 1 in `coral-embryo-leachate RNA` wax freezer boxes with green label tape:\n\nDNA samples (not quantified) are stored in -20C in JPG Lab FSH 236 in shelf 2 in `coral-embryo-leachate DNA` wax freezer box with yellow label tape:\n\nProtein flow-through (not quantified) are stored in -20C in JPG Lab FSH 236 in shelf 2 in `coral-embryo-leachate PROTEIN` wax freezer box with blue label tape:\n",
