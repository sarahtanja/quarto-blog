End volume of flow through + ethanol = 4mL\n\n-   Sequentially transfer RNA flow-through + ethanol in volumes =\\>700uL into the green Zymo Spin IIICG Column in a Collection Tube. This should take 6 'spins'\n\n-   Saved 1st 2 spins (1400uL) for protein tube. Once collected place in -20 freezer.\n\n-   Performed DNase I Treatment on green RNA spin column\n\n    ::: callout-caution\n    Forgot to run DNA/RNA Wash prior to DNase I treatment!!!\n    :::\n\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    \n    ```{.r .cell-code}\n    DB = 75*6\n    print(DB)\n    ```\n    \n    ::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n    ```\n    [1] 450\n    ```\n    :::\n    \n    ```{.r .cell-code}\n    Dnase = 5*6 \n    print(Dnase)\n    ```\n    \n    ::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n    ```\n    [1] 30\n    ```\n    :::\n    :::\n\n\n    -   I didn't invert to mix... I always lose some volume 'beads' in the lid when I do this. Instead I flicked the tube to mix it and kept all the volume down in the cnical end of the tube. This worked well and I had a full 80uL of treatment per spin column to work with.\n\n-   Warmed Zymo DNase-RNase Free Water to 55C in heat block before elution, and slowly dripped water directly over filter.\n\neluted DNA volume: 30uL in `Zymo DNase-RNase Free Water`\n\neluted RNA volume: 50uL in warmed (55C) `Zymo DNase-RNase Free Water`\n\n::: callout-important\nI upped the elution volume from 30 to 50 for RNA because I wanted to make sure the nuclease-free water volume was enough to saturate the whole filter and get the RNA from it... The minimum volume in the kit instructions is 50uL... And I do have an RNA Clean & Concentrator kit that allows me to reduce that if needed. As long as total RNA is at least 100ng, we're good. That means that qubit value (ng/uL) times the elution volume.\n:::\n\n# Qubit\n\nUsing the Invitrogen Thermo Fischer RNA High Sensitivity Assay Kit.\n\nPrepared working solution for 6 samples and two standards (plus some extra) in a 5mL tube:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbuffer <- 199*10\nprint(buffer)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 1990\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nreagent <- 1*10\nprint(reagent)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 10\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### RNA\n\nstandard 1: 96.43\n\nstandard 2: Error... re-run cal standards?
