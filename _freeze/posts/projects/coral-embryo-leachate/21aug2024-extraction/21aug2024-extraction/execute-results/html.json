End volume of flow through + ethanol = 4.2mL\n\n    -   Except 89M9, end volume of flow through + ethanol = 2.8mL\n\n-   Sequentially transfer RNA flow-through + ethanol in volumes =\\>700uL into the green Zymo Spin IIICG Column in a Collection Tube. This should take 6 'spins'\n\n-   Saved 1st 2 spins (1400uL) for protein tube. Once collected place in -20 freezer.\n\n-   Performed DNase I Treatment on green RNA spin column\n\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    \n    ```{.r .cell-code}\n    DB = 75*8\n    print(DB)\n    ```\n    \n    ::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n    ```\n    [1] 600\n    ```\n    :::\n    \n    ```{.r .cell-code}\n    Dnase = 5*8 \n    print(Dnase)\n    ```\n    \n    ::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n    ```\n    [1] 40\n    ```\n    :::\n    :::\n\n\n::: callout-note\n```         \n    I didn't invert to mix... I always lose some volume 'beads' in the lid when I do this. Instead I flicked the tube to mix it and kept all the volume down in the conical end of the tube. This worked well and I had a full 80uL of treatment per spin column to work with!\n```\n:::\n\n-   400uL of Prep Buffer\n-   700uL of DNA/RNA Wash Buffer\n-   400uL of DNA/RNA Wash Buffer, 2min\n-   Centrifuge 2min dry run\n-   Warmed Zymo DNase-RNase Free Water to 55C in heat block before elution, and slowly dripped 50uL of water directly over filter.\n\n# End Products\n\neluted DNA volume: 50uL in `Zymo DNase-RNase Free Water`\n\neluted RNA volume: 50uL in warmed (55C) `Zymo DNase-RNase Free Water`\n\n::: callout-important\nI upped the elution volume from 30 to 50 for RNA because I wanted to make sure the nuclease-free water volume was enough to saturate the whole filter and get the RNA from it... The minimum volume in the kit instructions is 50uL... And I do have an RNA Clean & Concentrator kit that allows me to reduce that if needed. As long as total RNA is at least 100ng, we're good. That means that qubit value (ng/uL) times the elution volume.\n:::\n\n# Qubit QAQC\n\nUsing the Invitrogen Thermo Fischer RNA High Sensitivity Assay Kit.\n\nPrepared working solution for 6 samples and two standards (plus some extra) in a 5mL tube:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbuffer <- 199*10\nprint(buffer)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 1990\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nreagent <- 1*10\nprint(reagent)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 10\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### RNA\n\nstandard 1: 94.53\n\nstandard 2: 1590.87\n\nRunID: 2024-08-22_062101[^2]\n\n[^2]: The Qubit date is ahead by 1 day (and I haven't figured out how to set it straight yet)\n\n+---------------+-------------+-------------+\n| sample_id     | qubit_rna_1 | qubit_rna_2 |\n+===============+=============+=============+\n| -   123C14    | 6.64 ng/uL  | 6.64 ng/uL  |\n+---------------+-------------+-------------+\n| -   89M9      | 9.12 ng/uL  | 9.10 ng/uL  |\n+---------------+-------------+-------------+\n| -   789H4     | 11.0 ng/uL  | 11.0 ng/uL  |\n+---------------+-------------+-------------+\n| -   101112L14 | 7.22 ng/uL  | 7.08 ng/uL  |\n+---------------+-------------+-------------+\n| -   101112L4  | 12.5 ng/uL  | 12.5 ng/uL  |\n+---------------+-------------+-------------+\n| -   101112L9  | 11.4 ng/uL  | 11.4 ng/uL  |\n+---------------+-------------+-------------+\n| -   131415M4  | 13.6 ng/uL  | 13.8 ng/uL  |\n+---------------+-------------+-------------+\n| -   131415H9  | 10.6 ng/uL  | 10.5 ng/uL  |\n+---------------+-------------+-------------+\n\n# Storage Location\n\nRNA samples are stored in -80C 'JPG Lab Thermo' freezer on shelf 1 (top shelf) in `coral-embryo-leachate RNA` wax freezer boxes with green label tape.\n\nDNA samples (not quantified) are stored in -20C in JPG Lab FSH 236 in shelf 2 in `coral-embryo-leachate DNA` wax freezer box with yellow label tape.\n\nProtein flow-through (not quantified) are stored in -20C in JPG Lab FSH 236 in shelf 2 in `coral-embryo-leachate PROTEIN` wax freezer box with blue label tape.\n",
