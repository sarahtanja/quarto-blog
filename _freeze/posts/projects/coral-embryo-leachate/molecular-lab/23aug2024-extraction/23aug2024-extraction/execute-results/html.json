Even in 89C14, which pooled 2 crosses instead of 3. Here I added extra DNA/RNA Shield to 89C14 to make the volume in the Zymo BashingBead for all samples uniform. AND despite forgetting to first run DNA/RNA Wash Buffer through the RNA filter prior to DNase treatment.\n:::\n\n# Extraction Notes\n\nThis uses the Zymo Quick-DNA/RNA Miniprep Plus Kit and unless otherwise specified here, follows the [M. Capitata Embryo DNA/RNA Extractions Protocol](https://sarahtanja.github.io/quarto-blog/posts/projects/coral-embryo-leachate/embryo-extractions.html). All centrifugation ocurred at 14800rpm/16,162 xg.\n\n-   Thaw samples to room temp\n\n-   Transfer and pool samples to one Zymo BashingBead Tube\n\n    -   89C14 I 'topped up' with DNA/RNA Shield so that it had 1.5mL volume same as the other samples\n\n-   Homogenize for 10 minutes\n\n    -   10 min Zymo BashingBead Tube\n\n        -   The 4hpf samples are hardier and take a little longer to lyse than the other embryonic phases\n\n-   Centrifuge for 1 min to get rid of bubbles\n\n    -   Check for complete lysis of embryos\n    -   Supernatent is clear!\n\n-   Transfer 2 550uL aliquots of cleared supernatent to one new nuclease-free tube\n\n-   Centrifuge for 1 min to pellet any beads\n\n-   Split cleared supernatent into two aliquots of 530uL & transfer each aliquot to a new nuclease-free tube\n\n-   Add 530uL of DNA/RNA Lysis Buffer to each tube ( a total of 1060uL volume in each tube )\n\n-   Vortex to mix for 5 seconds\n\n    ---\\> Proceed to purification\n\n-   Sequentially transfer each sample in aliquots of 700uL into yellow Spin-Away Filter in a Collection Tube and centrifuge for 30s. **SAVE THE FLOW THROUGH FOR RNA PURIFICATION by tipping flow through into spare collection tube (15mL Falcon Tube). This will take 3 passes.**\n\n-   Doubled volume of 100% (200 proof) ethanol to the RNA flow through in a falcon tube and vortexed to mix. End volume of flow through 2.1mL + ethanol 2.1mL = 4.2mL\n\n-   Sequentially transfer RNA flow-through + ethanol in volumes =\\>700uL into the green Zymo Spin IIICG Column in a Collection Tube. This should take 6 'spins'\n\n-   Saved 1st 2 spins (1400uL) for protein tube. Once collected place in -20 freezer.\n\n-   Performed DNase I Treatment on green RNA spin column\n\n-   ::: callout-warning\n    Forgot to do DNA/RNA Wash 400uL prior to DNase Treatment :(\n    :::\n\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    \n    ```{.r .cell-code}\n    DB = 75*10\n    print(DB)\n    ```\n    \n    ::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n    ```\n    [1] 750\n    ```\n    :::\n    \n    ```{.r .cell-code}\n    Dnase = 5*10 \n    print(Dnase)\n    ```\n    \n    ::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n    ```\n    [1] 50\n    ```\n    :::\n    :::\n\n\n::: callout-note\n```         \n    I didn't invert to mix... I always lose some volume 'beads' in the lid when I do this. Instead I flicked the tube to mix it and kept all the volume down in the conical end of the tube. This worked well and I had a full 80uL of treatment per spin column to work with!\n```\n:::\n\n-   400uL of Prep Buffer\n-   700uL of DNA/RNA Wash Buffer\n-   400uL of DNA/RNA Wash Buffer, 2min\n-   Centrifuge 2min dry run\n-   Warmed Zymo DNase-RNase Free Water to 55C in heat block before elution, and slowly dripped 50uL of water directly over filter.\n\n# End Products\n\neluted DNA volume: 50uL in `Zymo DNase-RNase Free Water`\n\neluted RNA volume: 50uL in warmed (55C) `Zymo DNase-RNase Free Water`\n\n::: callout-important\nI upped the elution volume from 30 to 50 for RNA because I wanted to make sure the nuclease-free water volume was enough to saturate the whole filter and get the RNA from it... The minimum volume in the kit instructions is 50uL... And I do have an RNA Clean & Concentrator kit that allows me to reduce that if needed. As long as total RNA is at least 100ng, we're good. That means that qubit value (ng/uL) times the elution volume.\n:::\n\n# Qubit QAQC\n\nUsing the Invitrogen Thermo Fischer RNA High Sensitivity Assay Kit.\n\nPrepared working solution for 6 samples and two standards (plus some extra) in a 5mL tube:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbuffer <- 199*15\nprint(buffer)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 2985\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nreagent <- 1*15\nprint(reagent)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 15\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### RNA\n\nstandard 1: 96.18\n\nstandard 2: 1912.96\n\nRunID: 2024-08-24_xxxxxx[^2]\n\n[^2]: The Qubit date is ahead by 1 day (and I haven't figured out how to set it straight yet)\n\n+---------------+-------------+-------------+\n| sample_id     | qubit_rna_1 | qubit_rna_2 |\n+===============+=============+=============+\n| -   456L14    | 5.20 ng/uL  | 5.22 ng/uL  |\n+---------------+-------------+-------------+\n| -   456M14    | 5.00 ng/uL  | 5.00 ng/uL  |\n+---------------+-------------+-------------+\n| -   789C4     | 7.52 ng/uL  | 7.60 ng/uL  |\n+---------------+-------------+-------------+\n| -   789H9     | 7.70 ng/uL  | 7.76 ng/uL  |\n+---------------+-------------+-------------+\n| -   89C14     | 5.06 ng/uL  | 5.02 ng/uL  |\n+---------------+-------------+-------------+\n| -   101112M4  | 12.5 ng/uL  | 12.6 ng/uL  |\n+---------------+-------------+-------------+\n| -   101112H4  | 8.00 ng/uL  | 8.10 ng/uL  |\n+---------------+-------------+-------------+\n| -   101112M9  | 7.60 ng/uL  | 7.62 ng/uL  |\n+---------------+-------------+-------------+\n| -   131415H14 | 6.12 ng/uL  | 6.22 ng/uL  |\n+---------------+-------------+-------------+\n| -   131415L9  | 9.70 ng/uL  | 9.70 ng/uL  |\n+---------------+-------------+-------------+\n\n# Storage Location\n\nRNA samples are stored in -80C 'JPG Lab Thermo' freezer on shelf 1 (top shelf) in `coral-embryo-leachate RNA` wax freezer boxes with green label tape.\n\nDNA samples (not quantified) are stored in -20C in JPG Lab FSH 236 in shelf 2 in `coral-embryo-leachate DNA` wax freezer box with yellow label tape.\n\nProtein flow-through (not quantified) are stored in -20C in JPG Lab FSH 236 in shelf 2 in `coral-embryo-leachate PROTEIN` wax freezer box with blue label tape.\n",
