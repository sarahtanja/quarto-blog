It also facilitates paired sample analysis, where each data point in one dataset is uniquely paired to a data point in the second dataset because we are making duplicate measurements on the *same sample*.\n\nThe challenge is lysing the sample enough to get the bacterial DNA (busting open all those layers of cell membranes!) and retaining host (coral) RNA integrity.\n\nThis protocol follows the Zymo Research [*Quick*-DNA/RNA Mininprep Plus Kit Instruction Manual](https://files.zymoresearch.com/protocols/_d7003t_d7003_quick-dna-rna_miniprep_plus_kit.pdf) with help and optimization from URI Putnam Lab Members Open Lab Notebook posts; such as Emma Strand's notebook post on [Zymo-Duet-RNA-DNA-Extraction-Protocol](https://emmastrand.github.io/EmmaStrand_Notebook/Zymo-Duet-RNA-DNA-Extraction-Protocol/), Kevin Wong's post on [Porites Extractions](https://kevinhwong1.github.io/KevinHWong_Notebook/20201027-DNA-RNA-Extractions-Porites-July-Bleaching-Experiment) and M.E. Schedl's post on [Porites Extractions](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/porites-zymo-rna/), as well as suggestions from a Zymo tech on [March 28th 2023](https://sarahtanja.github.io/lab-book/blog/daily-log/#28-mar-2023-t) regarding [optimized lysis protocols](https://files.zymoresearch.com/documents/bead_beating_short_protocol_tables.pdf) and suggestions from a Zymo tech on May 15th 2023 regarding optimized Proteinase K digestion temperature.\n\n::: callout-tip\n📞 Zymo is very responsive to phone calls!

Use immediately or store frozen aliquots.\n\n    -   [ ] 50-prep, add 275 µl water\n    -   [ ] 10-prep, add 55 µl water\n\n-   [ ] Reconstitute `lyophilized Proteinase K` at 20 mg/ml with `Proteinase K Storage Buffer` and mix by vortexing. Use immediately or store frozen aliquots.\n\n    -   [ ] 50-prep, (60 mg), add 3.12 ml buffer\n    -   [ ] 10-prep, (5 mg), add 0.26 ml (260 ul) buffer\n\n-   [ ] To prepare a 1X solution of `DNA/RNA Shield™`, add an equal volume (5mL for the whole solution) of `nuclease-free water` (not provided) to the `DNA/RNA Shield™` (2X concentrate) (1:1) and mix with a quick pulse on the vortexer.\n\n## Extraction Steps\n\n### Grind/Homogenize: Mortar & Pestle Samples\n\n1.  Take [dry-ice](#dry-ice) cooler to -80 freezer, pull out frozen samples and place them in the dry-ice cooler. Work quickly and carefully to sort through the vials and select the ones that you are working with. Nest the selected sample vials in the dry ice, and return the rest back to the -80 freezer. Bring working samples on dry-ice back to the lab bench.\n\n2.  Don cryo-gloves over nitrile gloves and ⚠️carefully⚠️ dispense a small amount (no more than 1L) of liquid nitrogen (LN2) into the transfer thermos. **Everyone working with LN2 should have taken the Liquid Nitrogen Online Safety Course found [HERE](https://www.ehs.washington.edu/training/liquid-nitrogen-safety)**\n\n3.  Grind each sample with mortar & pestle on LN2 -\n\n    1.  ⚠️carefully⚠️ pour a small amount of LN2 into a [sterilized](#sterilize) mortar\n    2.  Using [sterilized](#sterilize) forceps, pluck out coral fragments from the cryo vial and place in the mortar until you have as much material as about the size of an M&M (roughly a 16mm diameter sphere). Material amount does not have to be precise.\n    3.  Pestle the coral fragment until it is ground to a powder. Work quickly to ensure the sample remains frozen. Add more LN2 when it evaporates from the mortar. This step is challenging! LN2 evaporates very quickly and must be replenished multiple times.\n\nThe coral is also very hard and prone to 'squirting out' from under the pestle\n\n### Lyse: Bead-Bash Samples\n\n1.  Use [sterilized](#sterilize) scoopula to transfer the sample powder to its correspondingly labelled [bead bashing tube](https://www.zymoresearch.com/collections/lysis-tubes/products/zr-bashingbead-lysis-tubes-0-1-0-5-mm)\n\n2.  Aim to transfer 500uL of volume to each tube\n\n3.  Add 500uL of `DNA/RNA Shield` to each 2mL (0.1 - 0.5mm) bead-bashing tube with powdered sample and vortex to ensure powder is submersed in `DNA/RNA Shield`\n\n4.  Set bead-bashing tubes in Mortexer and vortex at high speed for 40 minutes\n\n### Proteinase-K Digestion\n\n1.  After bead bashing tubes are ['intensely bubbly'](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/Larvae-Ex-Protocol/#:~:text=Tubes%20after%20vortexing%20are%20intensely%20bubbly)\n\n2.  To tamp down bubbles, centrifuge in the mini-centrifuge for 1-2 minutes\n\n3.  Add Proteinase K & Buffer\n\n    -   Add the appropriate volume of Pro K buffer and Proteinase K (Proteinase K is stored in the -20 after being reconstituted)\n\n    -   (10:1 ratio of sample:digestion buffer) & (2:1 ratio of digestion buffer:Proteinase K)\n\n    -   For tubes with 500uL of DNA/RNA Shield add:\n\n        -   50ul pro k buffer\n        -   25ul proteinase K\n\n    -   If you have tubes with a larger volume you can scale up the volumes (ex for 700ul, you would use 70ul buffer and 35ul pro k)\n\n4.  Incubate in heat-block for 30mins at 55C\n\n5.  Vortex to mix\n\n6.  Centrifuge on max for 30s\n\n7.  Transfer $400 \\mu L$ of the cleared supernatent to a nuclease-free tube\n\n8.  Add $400 \\mu L$ of **DNA/RNA Lysis Buffer** to the supernatent(1:1) and vortex to mix\n\n### Purify DNA & RNA\n\n1.  Transfer the buffered supernatent (should be a total of 800uL, which can be passed through the filter in one go) to yellow **Spin-Away Filter** in a **Collection Tube** and centrifuge\n\n::: callout-danger\nSave The flow-through in the collection tube for RNA purification! At this step the DNA is in the yellow spin column filter and the RNA is in the flow through.\n:::\n\n2.  Tranfser the yellow **Spin-Away Filter** to a new **Collection Tube**\n\n3.  To the RNA flow-through, add 800uL (1:1) of 200-proof ethanol to the flow-through and mix by pipetting up and down 12 times\n\n4.  In aliquots up to 700uL, transfer the RNA in ethanol to the green **Zymo-Spin IIICG Column** in a **Collection Tube**, centrifuge, and discard the flow-through. This step binds the RNA to the green column filter.\n\n##### DNase 1 Treatment\n\n5.  Add 400uL **DNA/RNA Wash Buffer** to the green **Zymo-Spin IIICG Column**, centrifuge and discard the flow-through\n\n6.  To prepare **DNase 1 Reaction Mix**: $$\n    DNase\\, 1\\, volume = 5 \\mu L * (no.\\, of\\, sample\\, preps)\n    $$\n\n$$\nDNA\\, Digestion\\, Buffer\\, volume  = 75 \\mu L * (no.\\, of\\, sample\\, preps)\n$$\n\n-   Add 75uL of **DNA Digestion Buffer** per prep to a new nuclease-free tube\n-   Add 5uL of reconstituted **DNase 1** (thawed if previously frozen at $-20^{\\circ}C$) per sample prep to the nuclease-free tube\n-   Mix by gentle inversion\n\n7.  Carefully drip $80 \\mu L$ of **DNase 1 Reaction Mix** directly onto the green **Zymo-Spin IIICG Column** filter and let incubate at room temperature for 15mins\n\n8.  Add $400 \\mu L$ **DNA/RNA Prep Buffer** to each column and centrifuge at 16,000xg for 30s, then discard the flow-through\n\n9.  Add $700 \\mu L$ of **DNA/RNA Wash Buffer** to each column and centrifuge at 16,000xg for 30s, then discard the flow-through\n\n10. Add $400 \\mu L$ of **DNA/RNA Wash Buffer** to each column and centrifuge at 16,000xg for 2mins to ensure complete removal of the wash buffer, then discard the flow-through\n\n11. Carefully transfer the column into the FINAL nuclease-free tube labelled for containing the eluted DNA/RNA end products\n\n12. Add $50 \\mu L$ **DNase/RNase-Free Water** directly to the column matrix and centrifuge at 16,000xg for 30s\n\n13. Place FINAL eluted DNA/RNA tubes on ice\n\n14. Transfer $1 \\mu L$ of each eluted DNA/RNA sample to their respectively labelled Qubit assay tube, and place Qubit assay tubes with eluted DNA/RNA on ice\n\n15. Store FINAL eluted DNA/RNA tubes in wax boxes in the $-80^{\\circ}C$ freezer\n\n16. Take Qubit assay tubes to run Qubit quantification on eluted DNA and RNA\n\n    ## End Products\n\nThe end products are two 1.5mL vials per sample that contain:\n\n1.  50ul of DNA in nuclease-free water\n2.  50ul of RNA in nuclease-free water.\n\nPlace these vials on ice and for RNA proceed with [Qubit RNA Broad Range Protocol](https://sarahtanja.github.io/lab-book/protocols/protocol-qbit/)\n\nOR, to continue lab-work later,\n\nPlace them in a wax freezer box, label the box, and freeze them in the -80C.\n",
