::: {#hero-heading}
Hello! I'm currently a Masters student in the [Padilla-Gamiño Lab](https://padilla-gaminolab.weebly.com/) and part of the [School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences](https://fish.uw.edu/) at the University of Washington in Seattle. Please reach out if you have any questions or are interested in connecting!

# Research Interests

My research focuses on the multiple stressor impacts of microplastic-associated pollution and heat stress on coastal primary producers.

My overarching thesis explores the question "Does pollution undermine climate resilience?"
:::

I'm interested in exploring this question in the context of marine coastal habitat-forming organisms. These include scleractinian corals that form the structures of tropical coral reefs, soft-bodied anemones that cover the rocky intertidal habitats of the temperate coasts, and canopy-forming and understory kelps and seaweeds that provide habitat and organic carbon to various ecosystems.

Other questions I like to explore are "Do microplastic-associated pollutants alter the beneficial microbiome in marine organisms?", "Do microplastic pollutants alter gene expression in marine organisms?", and "Do microplastic pollutants decrease photosynthetic efficiency in the ocean?".

# Research Influences

I first began circling the issue of plastic pollution and marine debris in 2012 as an [intern](https://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=internexp.donohoe) with the Alaska Dept. of Fish & Game at a remote Steller sea lion rookery near Dixon Entrance. During population surveys, I photographed sea lions entangled in plastic trash, and later worked with the Pinniped Entanglement Group [(PEG)](https://pinnipedentanglementgroup.org/) to research biodegradable alternatives to plastic packing bands on fish boxes. I learned how difficult it is to amend a system reliant on plastic.

More recently, a seminar taught by my advisor [Dr. Padilla-Gamiño](https://fish.uw.edu/faculty/jacqueline-padilla-gamino/) raised my awareness of the [links](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iO3SA4YyEYU) between the fossil fuel industry, petrochemical-based plastics pollution, and the need for a plastics circular economy. Throughout the seminar, I was heavily influenced by a documentary titled, "[The Story of Plastic](https://www.youtube.com/show/SC2l9YPiNhgA1NwB2avpZwgw)" and a number of papers, including: "Rethinking Microplastics as a Diverse Contaminant Suite" [@rochman_rethinking_2019], and "Plastic leachates impair growth and oxygen production in Prochlorococcus, the ocean's most abundant photosynthetic bacteria" [@tetu2019].

The release of Rachel Carson's book Silent Spring in the early 1960s publicly unified two distinct branches of science, ecology and toxicology, into a new area called "ecotoxicology."

Phthalates are known endocrine-disrupting chemicals, which can have strong effects even at very low doses. This ecotoxicology concept is referred to as 'low-dose effects' and 'non-monotonic' response and was introduced to me by [Dr. Alison Gardell](https://directory.tacoma.uw.edu/employee/agardell) as a guest-lecturer to a course in Integrated Environmental Physiology taught by [Dr. Steven Roberts](https://fish.uw.edu/faculty/steven-roberts/) at the University of Washington in Seattle.

I became increasingly interested in studying these types of environmental pollutants because they challenge the concept of 'acceptable levels of pollution'. A book by [Dr. Max Liboiron](https://maxliboiron.com/), titled [*Pollution is Colonialism*](https://www.dukeupress.edu/pollution-is-colonialism), [@liboiron2021]taught me that 'acceptable levels of pollution' assumes settler and colonial access to Indigenous land and is not, in fact, acceptable.
