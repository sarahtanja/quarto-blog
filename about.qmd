::: {hero-heading}
I'm currently a Masters student in the [Padilla-Gamiño Lab](https://padilla-gaminolab.weebly.com/) and part of the [School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences](https://fish.uw.edu/) at the University of Washington in Seattle.

My research focuses on the multiple stressor impacts of plastic pollution and heat stress on coastal primary producers. More specifically, I am researching a suite of common chemicals added to plastic consumer-products called phthalate acid-esters, phthalates or plasticizers, and their potential impacts on gene expression and microbial community structure in corals.

### Research Influences

I first began circling the issue of plastic pollution and marine debris in 2012 as an [intern](https://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=internexp.donohoe) with the Alaska Dept. of Fish & Game at a remote Steller sea lion rookery near Dixon Entrance. During population surveys, I photographed sea lions entangled in plastic trash, and later worked with the Pinniped Entanglement Group [(PEG)](https://pinnipedentanglementgroup.org/) to research biodegradable alternatives to plastic packing bands on fish boxes. I learned how difficult it is to amend a system reliant on plastic.

More recently, a seminar taught by my advisor [Dr. Padilla-Gamiño](https://fish.uw.edu/faculty/jacqueline-padilla-gamino/) raised my awareness of the [links](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iO3SA4YyEYU) between the fossil fuel industry, petrochemical-based plastics pollution, and the need for a plastics circular economy. Throughout the seminar, I was heavily influenced by a documentary titled, "[The Story of Plastic](https://www.youtube.com/show/SC2l9YPiNhgA1NwB2avpZwgw)" and a number of papers, including: "Rethinking Microplastics as a Diverse Contaminant Suite" [@rochman_rethinking_2019], and "Plastic leachates impair growth and oxygen production in Prochlorococcus, the ocean's most abundant photosynthetic bacteria" [@tetu2019].

The release of Rachel Carson's book Silent Spring in the early 1960s publicly unified two distinct branches of science, ecology and toxicology, into a new area called "ecotoxicology."

> \"The definition and starting point of ecotoxicology as a formal and independent branch of science can be attributed to Professor Truhaut, who defined it in 1969 as \"the branch of Toxicology concerned with the study of toxic effects, caused by natural or synthetic pollutants, to the constituents of ecosystems, animal (including human), vegetable and microbial\"\" (Tincani et al., 2017, p. 2868) [@tincani2017]

Phthalates are known endocrine-disrupting chemicals, which can have strong effects even at very low doses. This ecotoxicology concept is referred to as 'low-dose effects' and 'non-monotonic' response and was introduced to me by [Dr. Alison Gardell](https://directory.tacoma.uw.edu/employee/agardell) as a guest-lecturer to a course in Integrated Environmental Physiology taught by [Dr. Steven Roberts](https://fish.uw.edu/faculty/steven-roberts/) at the University of Washington in Seattle.

I became increasingly interested in studying these types of environmental pollutants because they challenge the concept of 'acceptable levels of pollution'. A book by [Dr. Max Liboiron](https://maxliboiron.com/), titled [*Pollution is Colonialism*](https://www.dukeupress.edu/pollution-is-colonialism), [@liboiron2021]taught me that 'acceptable levels of pollution' assumes settler and colonial access to Indigenous land and is not, in fact, acceptable.

> "There is suffering in the world, in the work each of us is doing, we have chosen not to look away, but to do what is in our power to heal and repair, and I see that in every single one of you. My hope from what we've created here together, and in the affirmation that teaching and learning in communion with each other can be regenerative and transforming, so thank you." - Dr. Anne Beaudreau, SMEA 500 Autumn 2023
