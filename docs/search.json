    "text": "I’m currently a Masters student in the Padilla-Gamiño Lab and part of the School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences at the University of Washington in Seattle.\nMy research focuses on the multiple stressor impacts of microplastic-associated pollution and heat stress on coastal primary producers.\nMy main question is “Does pollution undermine climate resilience?”\nI’m interested in exploring this question in the context of marine coastal habitat-forming organisms. These include scleractinian corals that form the structures of tropical coral reefs, soft-bodied anemones that cover the rocky intertidal habitats of the temperate coasts, and canopy-forming and understory kelps and seaweeds that provide habitat and organic carbon to various ecosystems.\nOther questions I like to explore are “Do microplastic-associated pollutants alter the beneficial microbiome in marine organisms?”, “Do microplastic pollutants alter gene expression in marine organisms?”, and “Do microplastic pollutants decrease photosynthetic efficiency in the ocean?”.\n\n\n\nResearch Influences\nI first began circling the issue of plastic pollution and marine debris in 2012 as an intern with the Alaska Dept. of Fish & Game at a remote Steller sea lion rookery near Dixon Entrance. During population surveys, I photographed sea lions entangled in plastic trash, and later worked with the Pinniped Entanglement Group (PEG) to research biodegradable alternatives to plastic packing bands on fish boxes. I learned how difficult it is to amend a system reliant on plastic.\nMore recently, a seminar taught by my advisor Dr. Padilla-Gamiño raised my awareness of the links between the fossil fuel industry, petrochemical-based plastics pollution, and the need for a plastics circular economy. Throughout the seminar, I was heavily influenced by a documentary titled, “The Story of Plastic” and a number of papers, including: “Rethinking Microplastics as a Diverse Contaminant Suite” (Rochman et al. 2019), and “Plastic leachates impair growth and oxygen production in Prochlorococcus, the ocean’s most abundant photosynthetic bacteria” (Tetu et al. 2019).\n\nRochman, Chelsea M., Cole Brookson, Jacqueline Bikker, Natasha Djuric, Arielle Earn, Kennedy Bucci, Samantha Athey, et al. 2019. “Rethinking Microplastics as a Diverse Contaminant Suite.” Environ Toxicol Chem 38 (4): 703–11. https://doi.org/10.1002/etc.4371.\n\nTetu, Sasha G., Indrani Sarker, Verena Schrameyer, Russell Pickford, Liam D. H. Elbourne, Lisa R. Moore, and Ian T. Paulsen. 2019. “Plastic Leachates Impair Growth and Oxygen Production in Prochlorococcus, the Ocean’s Most Abundant Photosynthetic Bacteria.” Commun Biol 2 (May): 184. https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-019-0410-x.\nThe release of Rachel Carson’s book Silent Spring in the early 1960s publicly unified two distinct branches of science, ecology and toxicology, into a new area called “ecotoxicology.”\n\n“The definition and starting point of ecotoxicology as a formal and independent branch of science can be attributed to Professor Truhaut, who defined it in 1969 as”the branch of Toxicology concerned with the study of toxic effects, caused by natural or synthetic pollutants, to the constituents of ecosystems, animal (including human), vegetable and microbial”” (Tincani et al., 2017, p. 2868) (Tincani et al. 2017)\n\nTincani, Flávio H., Gabrieli L. Galvan, Antonio E. M. L. Marques, Gustavo S. Santos, Letícia S. Pereira, Thiago A. da Silva, Helena C. Silva de Assis, Ronilson V. Barbosa, and Marta M. Cestari. 2017. “Pseudoreplication and the Usage of Biomarkers in Ecotoxicological Bioassays.” Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry 36 (10): 2868–74. https://doi.org/10.1002/etc.3823.\n\nPhthalates are known endocrine-disrupting chemicals, which can have strong effects even at very low doses. This ecotoxicology concept is referred to as ‘low-dose effects’ and ‘non-monotonic’ response and was introduced to me by Dr. Alison Gardell as a guest-lecturer to a course in Integrated Environmental Physiology taught by Dr. Steven Roberts at the University of Washington in Seattle.\nI became increasingly interested in studying these types of environmental pollutants because they challenge the concept of ‘acceptable levels of pollution’. A book by Dr. Max Liboiron, titled Pollution is Colonialism, (Liboiron 2021)taught me that ‘acceptable levels of pollution’ assumes settler and colonial access to Indigenous land and is not, in fact, acceptable.\n\nLiboiron, Max. 2021. Pollution Is Colonialism. Duke University Press. https://doi.org/10.2307/j.ctv1jhvnk1.\n\n\n\nThis is me measuring out some filtered seawater at the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology (HIMB) in preparation for my pilot study on phthalate impacts on coral embryo development\n\n\n\n“There is suffering in the world, in the work each of us is doing, we have chosen not to look away, but to do what is in our power to heal and repair, and I see that in every single one of you. My hope from what we’ve created here together, and in the affirmation that teaching and learning in communion with each other can be regenerative and transforming, so thank you.” - Dr. Anne Beaudreau, SMEA 500 Autumn 2023"

    "text": "” Indeed Cruaud et al. (2014) and Fouhy et al. (2016) show that primer choice has a far deeper influence on microbial community than extraction method, although they did compare two bead-beating methods so the differences would be minimized. Primer choice is also particularly important, as some bacterial 16S primers are known to amplify coral mitochondrial DNA (Galkiewicz and Kellogg, 2008; Weber et al., 2017; Pollock F. J. et al., 2018; Meyer et al., 2019). As shown in our study, using the 515/806 V4 primers, L. pertusa may be particularly prone to mitochondrial amplification compared to the other coral species, resulting in fewer samples making it through quality control. This has also been reported for other coral species such as Porites lobata and Pocillopora verrucosa (Weber et al., 2017; Sonett et al., 2021). Thus far, the coral microbiology community has employed a variety of solutions to combat this molecular hurdle: (1) deeper sequencing, to allow for discarding the mitochondrial bycatch (Rosales et al., 2019); (2) agarose gel size separation of the 16S rRNA band from the coral mitochondrial band (Apprill et al., 2016); (3) alternative primer sets (Galkiewicz and Kellogg, 2008; Bayer et al., 2013; Liang et al., 2017); and (4) PNA clamps (Reigel et al., 2020). Further, the magnitude of under-annotation of coral mitochondria by existing bioinformatic taxonomies has recently been quantified and in silico improvements offered (Sonett et al., 2021). ” - (Pratte and Kellogg 2021)\n\nPratte, Zoe A., and Christina A.

The sequence homology between the primers and coral DNA was low, with only 7 of 21 bp matching in 63F and 7 of 20 bp matching in 1542R (Fig. 1). With such low binding strength, limited coral DNA amplification was expected. In addition, any coral 18S rRNA gene that was amplified would result in an amplicon length of 0.6 kbp, whereas bacterial 16S rRNA genes would have an amplicon length of 1.5 kbp. Test results indicated that during PCR, coral rRNA genes were amplified and appeared as a distinct band on the gel (Fig. 2, lane 3). This clear separation between coral and bacterial DNA allowed the isolation of the bacterial rRNA genes for further analysis. ” - (Galkiewicz and Kellogg 2008)\n\nGalkiewicz, Julia P., and Christina A.

    "text": "Research Overview\n\nMotivation\nBroadly, my interest in research is motivated by a desire for a healthy world. This is embodied by the ‘one health’ approach, which recognizes the connections between the health of people, animals, and the environment.\ninfographic sourced from Morrison et al. 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore about Sarah’s background, research interests & motivations can be found in the About page.\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch Topic Background\nThe goal of my Master’s thesis research is to gain insight into multiple-stressor interactions of warming oceans and plastic pollution on reef-building corals.\nUnder a CMIP6 climate scenario, it is forecasted that more than 75% of coral reefs will experience yearly severe bleaching before 2070 due to thermal stress. However, hope for resilient corals exists. In a prolonged marine heatwave event on Kiritimati Atoll, the largest coral atoll in the world, 100% of the corals near chronic anthropogenic disturbances died, but in areas that were not already stressed, 90% of corals died. The 10% that survived after bleaching are hypothesized to have recovered due to lower baseline levels of stress and better water quality compared to corals near chronic anthropogenic stressors like pollution and overfishing (Claar et al. 2020).\nCorals are threatened by global stressors, strategies for reducing local stressors may give corals an edge on survival\nWhile coral coverage has declined since the 50s, petroleum-derived plastic production and subsequent environmental plastic pollution have rapidly increased. An estimated 8 million tons of plastic and their associated additives end up in the oceans every year, with unknown impacts to important coastal coral reef ecosystems. Plastics are emerging environmental pollutants of growing concern for coral reefs, and are the source of a suite of environmental contaminants and persistent organic pollutants posing unknown risks to human and ecosystem health (Rochman et al. 2019). Plastics are non-biodegradable, persisting in the environment for centuries. UV radiation and mechanical weathering cause them to become brittle and fragment into microplastics <5mm, and nanoplastics <1mm. As plastics weather mechanically, they also weather chemically by leaching additives not covalently bonded to the plastic polymer resins (Hahladakis et al. 2018).\nFigure from Macleod et al. 2021\nThe most common plastic additives are a group of chemicals called plasticizers, also known as phthalates or phthalate acid esters (PAE). They are commonly added to PVC to increase flexibility and durability. Phthalates are known to mimic or interfere with hormones that control developmental, reproductive, and immune response in both humans and animals (Maqbool et al. 2016). Despite the presence of phthalates in 95% of tested coral samples (Montano et al. 2020), little is known about how phthalates interfere with coral physiology and reproduction. Previous research shows that plastic leachates experimentally added to plants, bacteria, and algae impair growth, reduce photosynthesis, and shift microbial communities in lab studies (Capolupo et al. 2020; O’Brien et al. 2022; Tetu et al. 2019).\n** Plastic pollution, and associated PAE pollution,\nMarine heatwaves, plastic manufacturing, and coastal ocean plastic pollution are all predicted to increase (MacLeod et al. 2021; Oliver et al. 2021).\nAs discussed in Claar et al. (2020), the success of coral recovery after bleaching will depend on levels of chronic anthropogenic stressors like pollution.\nI propose to conduct a series of studies that expose coral gametes and coral colonies to the multiple stressors of phthalate pollution and ocean warming, and subsequently measure the physiological responses, holobiont community structure, and gene expression between treatments. {: .notice–info}\nThis proposed research aligns with the mission of the School of Aquatic and Fisheries Sciences at the University of Washington, which is to conduct multidisciplinary research and education in order to understand, conserve, and manage marine ecosystems.\n\nREFERENCES\nCapolupo, Marco, Lisbet Sørensen, Kongalage Don Ranil Jayasena, Andy M.

Because of this, I expect we will see degradation between the environmental and experimental control samples. This study can’t account for the fact that corals in Kaneohe Bay may already be exposed to chronic low-levels of PAE pollution, so we can’t say our control baseline is ‘zero PAE exposure’.

Sterile clippers were used to remove an approximately 1-cm diameter region from the coral tissue. The tissue clipping was placed in 500 μL of DNA/RNA shield (Zymo Cat #R1100-50) with 0.5 mm glass beads (Fisher Scientific Cat #15-340-152) and homogenized by vortexing for 1 minute. The supernatant (450 μl) was transferred to a new tube and centrifuged at 9000 rcf for 3 min to remove any debris. The supernatant (300 μl) was mixed with 30 μl of Proteinase K (Zymo Cat #D3001-2-20) digestion buffer and 15 μl of Proteinase K in a new tube using a brief vortex step. Equal volume of Zymo lysis buffer (Zymo Cat #D7001-1-200) was added (345 μl) and extraction was completed as outlined in the manufacturer’s protocol. RNA concentration was quantified using the Qubit RNA Broad Range kit (Invitrogen Cat #Q10211) and integrity was assayed with an Agilent TapeStation 4200 system and the RNA Integrity Number (RIN) values ranged from 7.0–8.9. RNA libraries were prepared using the Zymo-Seq RiboFree Total RNA Library Kit (Zymo Cat #R3000) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, starting with 125 ng of RNA as input. Prepared libraries were sent to Zymo Research Corporation for sequencing using the Illumina HiSeq for paired end sequencing (2 × 100 base pairs [bp]).” - Wong & Putnam 2022 (Wong and Putnam 2022)\n\nWong, Kevin H., and Hollie M.

Bacteria distribution is not a normal distribution across populations…. This is a log ratio of (relative abundance/geometric mean). It’s a common method for transforming compositional data.

(Examples may relate to personal identify, interest, experience, etc.)\nI recently took part of the Identity, Belonging, and Inquiry in Science Program, and received special training to mentor students from diverse backgrounds. My mentee worked hard to complete research that she will present at the upcoming SACNAS conference, and I couldn’t be more proud.

In the first batch, 7 out of 20 samples were ‘off’ of the target concentration of 25ng/uL by enough to make me want to redo them (one was way high at 230ng/uL, others were too low at ~10ng/uL)\nI first re-ran the qubit (2nd qubit run) and got really poor results, with all the rerun samples too-low, (even the one that was previously 230ng/uL!?)\nI then re-normalized the samples and ran them on qubit again (3rd qubit run). In this run 4-PH1b hit the target, the rest were still too low\nI re-normalized the samples for a third time (with some increasing concentration modifications) and ran them on qubit for a 4th time. In this run 4-PA2a hit the target, the rest were still too low, and 2-PH2a even got worse despite increasing concentration.\nEnded the day unsatisfied with the following samples too low for normalization despite 4 attempts:\n\n2-PH2a - too low\n2-CA2a - 15.0, 15.4\n1-PA2a - 10.2, 10.0\n1-PH1a - 17.6, 17.6\n3-CH2a - 15.0, 14.6\n4-CA1a - 14.0, 13.0\n\n\n\n\n02-JUN-2023\n\nNormalized DNA (still have RNA left to do)\nTested normalized DNA on Qubit BR DNA assay, results overall were good but a smidge lower than my goal\nblank + microbial standard extraction\n\n\n\n01-JUN-2023\n\nPresented Bioinformatics final project for FISH 546\nAttended GSR Meeting\nAttended Seminar/TGIT"

The reason for this is that the NanoDrop will almost always over-“calculate” your sample concentrations (both RNA and DNA). The reason for this is that the NanoDrop is a spectrophotometer and measures light absorbance. With almost all DNA/RNA isolations, there will be residual DNA or RNA in your sample. The NanoDrop cannot distinguish between the two molecules, because they’re both made up of the same material; nucleotides. Nucleotides, regardless of their of their origin will absorb light at an average wavelength of 260nm.Since the Qubit assays use molecule-specific dyes, the dye will only bind to DNA or only to RNA. The dyes will not bind to any carryover of other types of molecules in the sample, so the accuracy (and sensitivity) is much, much higher than the NanoDrop.\n\n\n\n\n21-APR-2023\n\nmet with JPG April 1on1\n\ntalked about travel from Sept. 12 - Oct 9th, missing first 2 weeks of Autumn ’23 quarter, focusing that quarter on writing & analysis\nGOAL: have all sequences (16S & Transcriptomes) by September 1st 2023\nInitial 20 samples extracted & sent for sequencing before FHL\n2nd committee meeting to be held once initial 20 samples are run through 1st analysis for 16S & DGE, get advice on strategy for selecting remaining samples\nFollow-up samples extracted & sent for sequencing in July/August\nSend draft letter for NAH experiential learning fund to JPG on Monday April 24th\n\nInitial test round 2 samples extracted!!!\n\n3-CA1a\n3-Ea\n\nSampes selected from extr1 using a random number generator\ndetails can be found in the coral-DNA-RNA-lab-extractions repository\n\n\n\n\n\n20-APR-2023\n\ndownloaded fastq files for ‘fake data’ to continue script for bioinformatics workflow\nReceived Mortexer!

This is the beginning of my exploration of using GitHub to jot down thoughts, record ‘daily bits’, and organize the procedures and methods I’ll use in my thesis research\nzbengt introduced me to ‘elicit’, a lit review search AI. I searched “What is the role of endocrine signaling in cnidarian development” and found an exciting paper titled “Sea Anemones Responding to Sex Hormones, Oxybenzone, and Benzyl Butyl Phthalate: Transcriptional Profiling and in Silico Modelling Provide Clues to Decipher Endocrine Disruption in Cnidarians” authored by Morgan et al. in 2022\nI explored another AI, ChatGPT, and gave it the prompt “write me a poem about corals and oysters and mothers” and it returned:\n\n\nCoral reefs, a vibrant sea of life, A home for countless creatures, rife. Oysters, clams, and mussels too, All nestled safe, their shells in view.\nBut danger lurks, the waters warm, The coral bleaches, it’s colors torn. Mother Nature’s wrath, a sight to see, But we can help, if only we believe.\nFor mothers, fierce and loving beasts, Will do what it takes, to protect at least. Their young and home, with all their might, They’ll fight and strive, through day and night.\nSo let us join, in their noble quest, To save the reefs, and all the rest. For oysters, corals, and mothers too, Deserve a chance, to make it through.\n\n\nI followed up with a ChatGPT prompt “what are examples of endocrine signaling in cnidarians?” and it returned:\n\n\nEndocrine signaling is the process of communicating information from one cell to another by releasing hormones into the circulatory system or through direct contact. In cnidarians, endocrine signaling can be used for a variety of functions, including the regulation of growth, development, and behavior.\nOne example of endocrine signaling in cnidarians is the release of growth hormones, which stimulate the growth and development of cells and tissues. For example, in some species of cnidarians, the release of growth hormones is regulated by the action of a hormone called insulin-like growth factor (IGF).\nAnother example of endocrine signaling in cnidarians is the regulation of reproductive function. In some species of cnidarians, hormones called gonadotropins are released by the endocrine cells of the gonads (sex organs) to stimulate the production and release of gametes (sex cells).\nEndocrine signaling is also involved in the regulation of behavior in cnidarians. For example, some species of cnidarians release hormones called neuropeptides that act on the nervous system to regulate behaviors such as feeding, movement, and response to stimuli.\nOverall, endocrine signaling plays a vital role in the regulation of various functions in cnidarians, including growth, development, and behavior.\n\n\n\n​**Is this is all true!? I’ll have to follow-up with my own dive into primary literature…\n\nAnother ChatGPT AI response, when asked the same questions, but prompted to provide references:\n\n\nExamples of endocrine signaling in cnidarians include the release of hormones in response to stimuli such as touch, temperature changes, and changes in light intensity.\nFor example, the hormone adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (ACAP) is released from cnidocytes in response to a variety of stimuli and activates adenylate cyclase, leading to the production of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and the regulation of various physiological processes.\nOther signaling molecules that have been identified in cnidarians include cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), inositol triphosphate (IP3), and Ca2+-dependent signaling pathways.\nReferences:\nLevitan, D. R., & Kohn, A. B. (2001). The Endocrine System of Cnidarians. Annual Review of Physiology, 63(1), 319-344.\nSchmid, V., & Pfründner, R. (1995).

It also facilitates paired sample analysis, where each data point in one dataset is uniquely paired to a data point in the second dataset because we are making duplicate measurements on the same sample.\nThe challenge is lysing the sample enough to get the bacterial DNA (busting open all those layers of cell membranes!) and retaining host (coral) RNA integrity."

    "text": "Extraction Steps\n\nGrind/Homogenize: Mortar & Pestle Samples\n\nTake dry-ice cooler to the -80 freezer, pull out frozen samples and place them in the dry-ice cooler. Work quickly and carefully to sort through the vials and select the ones that you are working with. Nest the selected sample vials in the dry ice, and return the rest back to the -80 freezer. Bring working samples on dry-ice back to the lab bench.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlace the ❄️scoopulas❄️ and ❄️mini funnels❄️ in the dry ice 🧊 bucket!\n\n\n\nDon cryo-gloves over nitrile gloves and ⚠️carefully⚠️ dispense a small amount of liquid nitrogen (LN2) into the transfer thermos. Everyone working with LN2 should have taken the Liquid Nitrogen Online Safety Course found HERE\nGrind each sample with mortar & pestle on LN2 -\n\n⚠️carefully⚠️ pour a small amount of LN2 into a sterilized mortar\nUsing sterilized forceps, pluck out coral fragments from the cryo vial and place in the mortar until you have about as much material as a lima bean. Material amount does not have to be precise.\nPestle the coral fragment until it is ground to a powder5. Work quickly to ensure the sample remains frozen. Add more LN2 when it evaporates from the mortar. This step is challenging! LN2 evaporates very quickly and must be replenished multiple times.\n\n\n5 The coral fragments are prone to ‘squirting out’ from under the pestle. Don’t lose sample material! Rather than use your arms to ‘stir’ the fragments in a circular motion, crush the fragments by firmly placing the pestle square atop a fragment and press your whole torso body-weight onto the pestle. Think like a hydraulic press!\n\nLyse: Bead-Bash Samples\n\nAdd 500uL of DNA/RNA Shield to each 2mL (0.1 - 0.5mm) bead-bashing tube\n\n\n\nIn initial extractions I only used 500uL of DNA/RNA Sheild and was advised to increase it to at least 800uL by a Zymo rep:\n\n“A minimum of 800 µl of liquid volume is what we typically recommend when working with the BashingBead Tubes. This is because anything lower may lead to inefficient bead movement during shaking, oversaturation of content, and difficulties when transferring sample from the tube without disturbing the debris. All of these can lead to impurity by precipitation/clogging in the columns, therefore we highly recommend increasing the amount of DNA/RNA Shield for processing.”\n\n\nUse chilled, sterilized scoopula and a sterilized chilled mini-funnel to transfer the sample powder to its correspondingly labelled bead bashing tube\nAim to transfer 500uL of powdered volume (take up about 1/4th of the 2mL tube, or an equal volume as the beads)\nCap the bead-bashing tube and shake it like a Polaroid picture\nOpen the tube, and ‘top-off’ the sample with another 1000uL of DNA/RNA Shield, bringing the total volume to 1500uL\nVortex to ensure powder is fully submersed in DNA/RNA Shield\nSet bead-bashing tubes in Mortexer and homogenize at high speed for 40 minutes\n\n\n\nProteinase-K Digestion\n\nGet the Proteinase K out of the -20 freezer & set the heat-block to warm up to 55C for 30mins\nAfter bead bashing, tubes are ‘intensely bubbly’, to tamp down bubbles, centrifuge in the mini-centrifuge for 1min\nTransfer 600uL of supernatent to a new nuclease-free tube, making sure not to disturb beads and debris at the bottom of the bead-bashing tube6\nAdd Proteinase K & Buffer\n\nAdd the appropriate volume of Pro K buffer and Proteinase K (Proteinase K is stored in the -20 after being reconstituted)\n(10:1 ratio of sample:digestion buffer) & (2:1 ratio of digestion buffer:Proteinase K)\nFor tubes with approximately 500uL of sample add:\n\n50ul pro K buffer\n25ul proteinase K\n\n\nVortex to mix\nIncubate in the heat-block for 30mins at 55C\nVortex to mix & centrifuge on max for 2mins to pellet any debris\nTransfer 350uL of the cleared supernatent to a new 1.5mL nuclease-free tube, making sure not to disturb any debris at the bottom of the tube\nAdd 350uL of DNA/RNA Lysis Buffer to the supernatent(1:1) and vortex to mix\n\n6 Why do we transfer from the bead-bashing tube to two different nuclease-free tubes in this step? Jerry Yu from Zymo says:\n\n“We are worried about the sample debris remaining in the tube, which should still contain protein. One of the reasons for Proteinase K treatment at this step is to break down protein in the solution to make it less viscous/sticky, so the column can process it without issue. By transferring the mixture out, the treatment could be more efficient.”"

Jerry Yu from Zymo says:\n\n“You are correct with the beer analogy. By slowly dispensing wash buffer along the inner radius of the column, you can rinse off salts/residuals from previous spins, so future spins will be cleaner.”\n\n8 Another tip from Zymo:\n\nThe goal of rinsing and reducing the volume of wash buffer is to avoid residual buffer from previous washes to end up in the elution, which will reduce purity. If volume of the wash buffer is increased in the final wash step, make sure to also increase the centrifugation time (e.g., 2 minutes) or include a second spin without buffer (dry spin) to ensure complete removal of the buffer prior to elution."

If the data do not meet the assumptions of normality required for parametric tests like the paired t-test, but you want to determine if there is a trend between two paired samples, you can use the Wilcoxon paired-sample T test. This is a non-parametric statistical test used to compare two related samples or repeated measures. It is appropriate for this dataset, because each row of DNA and RNA were extracted from the same sample. Here we really want to know if our Dual extraction method is biased toward optimizing yield for DNA or RNA, or if there is any trend at all. > Our null and alternate hypotheses are:\nH0: There is no trend between the paired samples.\nH1: There is a trend between the paired samples.\n\nwilcox.test(x=qubit_scores$qubit_dna_avg, y=qubit_scores$qubit_rna_avg, paired=TRUE, alternative = 'two.sided')\n\n\n    Wilcoxon signed rank exact test\n\ndata:  qubit_scores$qubit_dna_avg and qubit_scores$qubit_rna_avg\nV = 86, p-value = 0.498\nalternative hypothesis: true location shift is not equal to 0\n\n\nThe Wilcoxon signed-rank test, as a non-parametric test, determines whether there is a shift or trend in the paired observations but does not provide information about the direction or magnitude of the shift. It only tells you that there is a significant difference between the paired samples, but it does not indicate which sample has higher values or the direction of the shift.\nTo determine the direction of the shift, you would need to examine the data and calculate the median or mean of the paired differences. If the median or mean of the differences is positive, it suggests that the second sample tends to have higher values than the first sample. Conversely, if the median or mean is negative, it indicates that the first sample tends to have higher values than the second sample.\nTo get a better understanding of the direction and magnitude of the shift, you may consider plotting the paired differences or constructing a confidence interval around the median or mean difference. This can provide additional insights into the nature of the shift and help you interpret the results more accurately."

To prevent those large files from clogging up our ability to ‘git push’, we can use built-in hooks to automatically ignore files larger than 100 MB (no matter the directory or file name!). Here are the steps to follow:\n\nCreate a new text file in the .git/hooks/ directory of your repository called pre-commit\n\nSelect the More tab with the gear icon under the RStudio Files navigator bar and select ‘show hidden files’ to see the .git folder.\n\nAdd the following text to the .git/hooks/pre-commit file:\n\n#!/bin/sh\n\n# Maximum file size (in bytes)\nmax_file_size=104857600\n\n# Find all files larger than max_file_size and add them to the .gitignore file\nfind . -type f -size +$max_file_size -exec echo \"{}\" >> .gitignore \\;\n\nThis code sets the max_file_size variable to 100 MB and then uses the find command to locate all files in the repository that are larger than the specified max_file_size. The exec option of the find command appends the name of each file that matches the criteria to the .gitignore file.\n\nor\n#!/bin/bash\necho “automatically ignoring large files” find . -size 5M | sed ‘s|^./||g’ >> .gitignore cat .gitignore | sort | uniq > .gitignore\ngit diff –exit-code .gitignore exit_status=$? if [ $exit_status -eq 1 ] then set +e for i in cat .gitignore do set +e git rm –cached $i done\ngit add .gitignore\ngit commit .gitignore --no-verify -m\"ignoring large files\"\n\necho \"ignored new large files\"\n\nIt is pretty brute force and the downside is that in case there were new large files added by the git hook, the origin commit fails because the state (hash) changed. So you need to execute another commit to actually commit what you have staged. Consider this as a feature telling you that new large files were detected ;-)\n\nSave the pre-commit file and make it executable by running the following command in Terminal from your base git directory:\nchmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit\nWith these changes, whenever you run a git commit command, Git will first execute the pre-commit hook, which will automatically add any files larger than 100 MB to the .gitignore file. This will prevent Git from tracking these files in the repository going forward."

B. muscatinei\nFor anemones hosting B. muscatinei :\n\n\nMaximum midday irradiance usually exceeded \\(2,000 mu/ mol m^{-2} s^{-1}\\) , where no photoinhibition was observed (Verde & McCloskey 1996)\nUnder experimental manipulations in the laboratory, ZX photosynthetic rates were suppressed at 2,000 lmolÆm–2Æs–1, indicative of photoinhibition (see below). Photoinhibitory phenomena are often associated with damage to the photosynthetic apparatus. If so, the ZX would likely devote more energy and resources to damage control and repair; subsequently less energy and photosynthetic products would be available to support continued algal growth. Since ZX also displayed photoinhibition at 1,400 lmolÆm–2Æs–1, yet did not show a reduction in MI, the onset of the deleterious effects of damage repair would seem to occur at intensities above 1,400 lmolÆm–2Æ s–1. In contrast, anemone metabolic rates were elevated at 2,000 lmolÆm–2Æs–1; it may simply be that the host requires more energy and organic resources to meet its elevated respiratory demands, and the ZX symbiont provides both at the expense of its own growth E. and L. (2002).\nNot light saturated up to \\(550 mu/ mol m^{-2} s^{-1}\\) (Verde & McCloskey 1996)\nB. muscatinei peaked at $800 mu/ mol m^{-2} s^{-1}$ E. and L.

    "text": "Symbiosis\nA. elegantissima gains symbionts through horizontal transmission (Lajeunesse and Trench 2000). (Trench 1987)\nNormally, A. elegantissima expels symbionts from its coelenteron in a bolus of mucus and undigested material. Expulsion of symbionts should not be confused with “bleaching” phenomenon in reef corals, and may serve an ulterior purpose and undergo a different process. The anemones ‘cull’ or ‘weed’ the symbionts to maintain an optimal symbiont population density.\nThe optimized symbiont density is reported in the literature as 106 cells·mg-1 of host protein and 1-5·106 cells·cm-2 (McCloskey, Cove, and Verde 1996).\n\nSea anemones of the genus Anthopleura along northeast Pacific intertidal shores engage in a particularly unique symbiosis with two especially phylogenetically and physiologically different symbionts: the chlorophyte Elliptochloris marina (Letsch et al., 2009) and the dinoflagellate Symbiodinium muscatinei (LaJeunesse and Trench, 2000). - Dimond et al. (2017)\n\nThe Symbiodinium muscatinei(Lajeunesse and Trench 2000)were reclassified as Breviolum muscatinei\n\nLajeunesse, Tc, and Rk Trench. 2000. “Biogeography of Two Species of Symbiodinium (Freudenthal) Inhabiting the Intertidal Sea Anemone Anthopleura Elegantissima (Brandt).” The Biological Bulletin 199 (2): 126–34. https://doi.org/10.2307/1542872.\n\nMcCloskey, L. R., Timothy G. Cove, and E.Alan Verde. 1996. “Symbiont Expulsion from the Anemone Anthopleura Elegantissima (Brandt) (Cnidaria; Anthozoa).” Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology 195 (2): 173–86. https://doi.org/10.1016/0022-0981(95)00079-8.\nMost anemones only host one symbiont, or the other. It is rare for mixed assemblages of the two ‘symbiont morphs’ to occur. In the paper by McCloskey, Cove, and Verde (1996), they found that among 91 anemones, >95% had a single symbiont type. The chlorophyte Elliptochloris marina is relatively sensitive to light and is limited to cooler, low light environments typical of the low intertidal. The dinoflagellate B. muscatinei, on the other hand, tolerates higher light and temperatures and is more commonly found in anemones in the upper intertidal zone. Aposymbiotic (non-symbiont forming) A. elegantissima anemones can be found thriving in very low light conditions, often inside rocky crevasses within the intertidal zone. Transplantation of A. elegantissima anemones with chlorophyte E. marina symbionts to warmer, higher-light environments results in shifts in the symbiont population from E. marina to B. muscatinei (Dimond et al. 2017).\nAnemones hosting B. muscatinei have a golden-brown color, while those that host E. marina are mossy green. Symbiont type can be verified by viewing excised tentacles under light microscopy, and commonly, no mixed-symbiont populations are observed (Dimond et al. 2017).\n\nDimond, James L., Shad Orechovesky, Jonas Oppenheimer, Jean Rodríguez-Ramos, and Brian L.

    "text": "On Monday, March 18th, 2024 we collected Anthopleura elegantissima from Owen’s Beach at Point Defiance Park in Tacoma, Washington under WDFW scientific collection permit Tanja 24-010. It was a beautiful day, and the ‘Mountain was out’, gowned in snowy white against a blue sky; not a single cloud. It was the kind of spring day that makes people of the 47th latitude giddy. The collections encompassed the low tide, between 18:27 and 19:40, corresponding to a +1ft MLLW to +0.9ft MLLW tide height (determined by nearest tide station, 9446484) at time of collection. We collected 7 anemones from 12 distinct aggregates. The collections were done efficiently by hand using metal scoopulas1 to gently nudge under the pedal disc of an anemone, and further work under the pedal disc to loosen it from its’ substrate. Once freed, the anemones were transferred in polypropylene mesh bags labelled with their aggregate number (1-12) to a cooler with seawater. One anemone from each aggregate was immediately snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. This was done to preserve an environmental control with which to compare any microbiome changes that may occur due to the transfer from the intertidal zone to the lab. The remaining 6 anemones from each aggregate were transferred to individual 60mm petri dishes that had been acid-washed, and labelled with lab pressure tape and sharpie. The anemones, set in their new petri-dish homes, were placed in a recirculating seawater table in the Padilla-Gamino Lab located at the University of Washington in Seattle by 22:00, just 4 hours post collection. The frozen specimens were stored in the Padilla-Gamino Lab - 80 o C freezer for later processing.1 This method was suggested to me by Dr. Alan Verde in personal communication, and I was thrilled by how well it worked! Thank you, Verde!\nThe remainder of this post will provide tables and photos detailing the location of the collection sites and documenting the tremendous gift of friendship I have in those who were willing to ‘come poke anemones with me’."

I think that 10 g/L is reasonable as the highest concentration to be tested.\nHowever in the literature you can find experiments with level of plastic particles at even 1g/L. Of course, at this concentration they report coral bleaching and mortality but in my opinion it is like to say that plastic is toxic to humans because cause asphyxia  when you put your head in a plastic bag."

We’re going under!\nPhotosynthesis occurs in two out of three Domains of life: Bacteria (cyanobacteria, (a.k.a. blue-green algae) & Eukarya (red, brown, & green algae & plants!) Archaea, the third Domain, is made up of a group of single-celled microorganisms that do not photosynthesize. Here, I will focus mostly on the marine endosymbionts that form symbioses with marine invertebrates.\n\nPrimary endosymbiosis\nThe evolution of the chloroplast can be traced back to when an alphaproteobacterium engulfed a cyanobacterium. This event is called the ‘primary endosymbiosis’ and is illustrated in the diagram below by a green pac-man shape (the alphaproteobacterium) engulfing a blue football-shaped cyanobacterium. Primary endosymbiosis resulted in plastids (here plastids mean chloroplasts and mitochondria) that are bounded by two membranes. The lineage of primary endosymbiosis diverged into three: red algae, green algae, and glaucophytes.\nThe green algae are thus products of primary endosymbiosis and are characterized by two layers of membranes around their plastids. This includes their chloroplasts.\n\n\n\nScreenshot from P.J. Keeling(Keeling 2010) , Figure 2.

    "text": "The objective of this study is to examine the combined effects of thermal stress and marine microplastic leachate on photosynthetic efficiency, microbiome community, and gene expression in the aggregating sea anemone Anthopleura elegantissima and the algal symbiont Breviolum muscatinei. In essence, this study is both a global change study examining impacts of thermal stress on marine intertidal invertebrates, and an ecotoxicological study that assesses impacts of marine microplastic leachate associated with marine plastic pollution on a cnidarian host and an algal symbiont. We’ve chosen Anthopleura elegantissima as our study species because it is a clonal cnidarian that can form symbiotic relationships, can be collected and studied locally in the Pacific Northwest, and has an annotated genome. Anthopleura elegantissima can form symbioses with either the chlorophyte Elliptochloris marina (letsch2009?) or the dinoflagellate Breviolum muscatinei (lajeunesse2000?). In this study, we will only be working with the ‘golden brown’ anemones that are associated with the dinoflagellate Breviolum muscatinei in order to reduce variation in our response variables due to symbiont type. The golden brown anemones are also much easier to find and collect, as they are found in the mid to upper intertidal.\n\n\n\n\nMarine microplastics are an emerging pollutant of concern that have only been widely ‘in play’ for the last 80 years\nPlastics in landfills, polyester microfibers from washing machine sewage, and non-source point plastic pollution caught in road runoff all have chemical additives and chemical degredation derivatives that leach out of them forming a cocktail of chemicals and compounds termed ‘leachate’ that pollutes the environment\nUrban coastal and intertidal environments are important habitats that support healthy oceans, healthy recreation, and healthy food security for the nation. The near coastal environment adjacent to urban centers may be one of the most exposed to marine microplastic leachate pollution\nYet, very little is known about the impacts of this type of pollution because it’s hard to study (plastics are everywhere!), and as stated previously, it’s only been around for the last 80 years coinciding with increased plastic production and integration into consumer products\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe don’t know if/how marine microplastic leachate affects Cnidarians\nWe don’t know if/how marine microplastic leachate affects Cnidarians in the context of multiple stressors (i.e. a marine heatwave = thermal stress)\nWe don’t know if/how marine microplastic leachate affects the symbiotic relationship between Cnidarian hosts and their algal symbionts\n\n\nWhy do we care about filling in this knowledge gap?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions\n\n\n\n\nHow do the combined stressors of marine microplastic leachate and thermal stress affect the physiology of the temperate coastal anemone Anthopleura elegantissima?\nDoes marine microplastic leachate reduce Cnidarians’ capacity for resilience to thermal stress?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHypotheses\n\n\n\n\nThermal stress alone will have no significant impact on anemone respiration\nWe expect that net photosynthesis will i\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions\n\n\n\n\nDoes exposure to marine microplastic leachate disrupt the function of the A. elegantissima microbiome community?\nDoes exposure to thermal stress disrupt the function of the A. elegantissima microbiome community?\nIs the microbial community composition and functional response to the combined stressors of marine microplastic leachate and thermal stress additive?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHypotheses\n\n\n\n\nMicrobial community composition and function play a critical role in the stress response of Cnidarians\nMarine microplastic leachate exposure changes the microbial community\nMarine microplastic leachate exposure changes the microbial community in such a way that Cnidarians are more susceptible to thermal stress\nMarine microplastic leachate and thermal stress act synergistically to disrupt Cnidarian microbial communities\nThe microbial community changes differently when exposed to microplastic stress as compared to thermal stress\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHypotheses\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHypotheses\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHypotheses\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEquipment list\n\n\n\n40+(12*6)\n\n[1] 112\n\n5*5\n\n[1] 25\n\n\nSpecimen collection\nAnthopleura elegantissima will be collected from 12 distinct aggregates at Owens Beach, Point Defiance, Tacoma.

Individual anemones will be collected from each of 12 clonal aggregates by very gently scraping their pedal disc to separate it from their attached substrate. We will move 5 meters or more to what we can assume is a genetically distinct aggregate and repeat this, until we have 7 individuals from each of 12 clonal mats (a total of 84 individuals). One individual from each aggregate will be immediately flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen to serve as an environmental baseline control for both microbial and gene expression metrics. The remaining 72 anemones will be kept for experimentation.\n\n\nSpecimen housing & acclimation\nThe anemones will be transported in sea water from the collection site back to the University of Washington campus where they will be housed individually in labelled glass beakers that will be submerged in a recirculating seawater table and allowed to acclimate for at least 2 weeks to heal their pedal disc.\n\n\nTreatment preparation\nWe will prepare plastic leachate in seawater as a treatment by soaking 250mg of plastic in 250ml of seawater in a glass beaker for 1 week with a stir-bar or shaker table. The 100% leachate that is formed from this soak has a known phthalate acid ester (PAE) concentration of ~10%, equaling 100mg of PAE per 250ml of seawater. This highly concentrated leachate will be diluted 1:1000 in filtered seawater to get to an environmentally relevant concentration of 100ug of PAE per liter of seawater.\n\n\nExperiment\nThe experiment will be setup as a 2x3 factorial design to test thermal stress and plastic leachate. Two seawater tables will be used as temperature baths, one set at an elevated temperature of 20\\(^{\\circ}\\)C and another at an ambient temperature of 10\\(^{\\circ}\\)C. Temperature will be controlled by an Apex Neptune Aquarium controller coupled to heat exchangers and light level will be standardized using Kessil aquarium lights. 20 specimens (two of each clonal mat) will be randomly placed in one of each water temperature treatment bath. Seatable water volume level will be dropped to just below the lip of the specimen beakers, and specimen beakers will be filled with either filtered seawater or with the dilute plastic seawater leachate treatment. The exposure will last 48 hours, after which anemones will be flash frozen in liquid nitrogen.\n\n\n\nFigure 2. 2x3 Factorial experimental design in which 1 clonal genotype from each of 10 clonal mats will be exposed to 4 scenarios, thermal stress, plastic leachate pollution, multiple/combined thermal and leachate pollution stresses, and the control of ambient temp and filtered seawater.\n\n\n\n\nSample Processing\nFlash frozen samples will be processed using the commercial Zymo Dual DNA/RNA MiniPrep kit to extract microbial DNA and host and symbiont RNA. The microbial DNA data will be used to analyze if there are any discernible shifts in the microbiome related to the treatments. The RNA will help us identify molecular pathways that may be disrupted by heat, leachate, and/or the combined multiple stressors of both in a cnidarian and its algal symbiont.\n\n\nMerit\nThis shotgun of stress response variables will serve to offer a holistic view of cnidarian host and algal symbiont physiological response to temperature and plastic pollution leachate stress. It is well known that ocean heat waves are becoming more frequent and intense. Simultaneously, marine plastic pollution is becoming more prevalent and the chemical additives associated with plastic have become ubiquitous in our environments. As plastics weather mechanically, they also weather chemically by leaching additives not covalently bonded to the plastic polymer resins (Hahladakis et al. 2018). The most common plastic additives are a group of chemicals called plasticizers, also known as phthalates or phthlate acid esters (PAE). They are commonly added to PVC to increase flexibility and durability. However, phthlatates are known to mimic or interfere with hormones that control developmental, reproductive, and immune response in both humans and animals (maqboolReviewEndocrineDisorders2016?). Previous research shows that plastic leachates experimentally added to plants, bacteria, and algae impair growth, reduce photosynthesis, and shift microbial communities in lab studies (capolupo2020?; O’Brien et al. 2022; Tetu et al. 2019). However, little is known about environmental concentrations of plastic leachate in the context of increasing ocean temperatures. Marine heatwaves, plastic manufacturing, and pollution are predicted to increase (macleodGlobalThreatPlastic2021?; oliverMarineHeatwaves2021?). Therefore, it is urgent that we understand how thermal stress and plastic pollution interact and the effects they may have on coastal marine organisms, which are likely experiencing both the most extreme thermal stress and the highest amount of plastic pollution.\n\n\n\nHahladakis, John N., Costas A.

These samples are ‘snapshots’ of the corals after they were collected from Kaneohe Bay and fragmented to ~3cm nubbins\nModifications incorporated:\n\nAdded 500uL DNA/RNA Shield to bead bashing tube before adding powdered sample\nAfter adding the powdered sample, I added another 1000uL of DNA/RNA Shield and vortexed with a quick pulse to submerge all of the powdered sample\n1Transferred 600uL of supernatent from bead bashing tube to nuclease-free tube after Mortexing, and saved the bead-bashing tube with remaining ~400uL of homogenized tissue in DNA/RNA Shield as backup\nTransferred 350uL of PK Digested sample to a new tube, saved the leftover PK Digested tube sample as backup\nAdded a dry spin for 2min after the last wash buffer spin to ensure complete removal of wash buffer\neluted 270uL of DNA & 60uL RNA in Hyclone nuclease-free water (expired Oct 2021..?)\n\n\n1 Before this extraction, I had been conducted PK Digestion in the bead bashing tube. I got some advice that this could be contaminating the purity of the RNA:\nJerry Yu from Zymo says:\n\n“We are worried about the sample debris remaining in the tube, which should still contain protein. One of the reasons for Proteinase K treatment at this step is to break down protein in the solution to make it less viscous/sticky, so the column can process it without issue. By transferring the mixture out, the treatment could be more efficient.”\n\n2 Kind of arbitrary.. trying to hit something between 100 and 50 microliters"

Half remains in the freezer.\n3-Ea pestled 2nd, all of the material in the cryo vial was used, but half fell on the floor and had to be thrown out.\nLN2 evaporates very quickly and had to be replenished multiple times\nWe did this with two people (NAH to grind, SST to carefully dispense LN2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nThe coral is very hard to pestle and prone to ‘squirting out’ from under the pestle! Learned that it is better to leverage whole body weight above the mortar and work to crush the coral fragment like a hydraulic press. When pestling sample 3-Ea at an angle, half of the fragment shot out of the mortar and ended up on the floor (which was discarded and not used), resulting in less starting material left to use in the mortar. This could be a reason why 3-Ea had ‘out of range, too low’ result for Qubit!\n\n\n\nUsed sterilized scoopula to transfer the sample powder to its correspondingly labelled bead bashing tube.\n\nFor this step we made small disposable funnels from lab weigh-paper and label tape to try and make this easier. ⚠️Unfortunately, this didn’t work very well! ⚠️ Finely ground powder melts fast and the cold from the LN2 means that all the moisture in the lab is condensing on the sample. As soon as it is removed from the mortar by the scoopula it begins to melt , condense water vapor, and turn into a sticky booger! It doesn’t slide nice and dry down the paper funnel. We had to tamp it vigorously to get it into the bead bashing tube.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nFixed the melting booger problem by getting small metal funnels and metal scoopulas and chilling them on dry-ice, with the goal being to keep the powder cold during the transfer from the mortar to inside the bead bashing tube. This worked really well!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfunnel weigh paper diagram\n\n\n\nOnce the sample powder was in the bead bashing tube, we quickly added 750uL of DNA/RNA Sheild to the bead bashing tube, shook it vigorously & vortexed it to ensure the sample was submersed in DNA/RNA Sheild\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nAfter bead beating tube was very very bubbly! Would suggest centrifuging after the bead-beating homogenization ‘shaker’ step prior to opening tube lid and putting it in the bead bashing tube before the sample in future extractions.\n\n\n\nWe then set bead-bashing tubes in the Mortexer and let it mix at max speed for 40 mins\nAdded 30uL of Proteinase-K Digestion Buffer directly to the bead bashing tube\nAdded 15uL of Proteinase-K directly to the bead bashing tube\nIncubated (left to sit) at room temp for 30 minutes\neluted 100ul of DNA in nuclease-free water\neluted 100ul of RNA in nuclease-free water"

Unfortunately, in this pilot experiment, we lack a methanol solvent control. This means that we cannot differentiate the effects of the phthalate pollutants from the effects of the methanol on the microbial community changes when compared to the no-pollution controls.\nHowever, this project and the data can be used as a ‘practice set’ for developing microbiome analysis pipelines and figures.\nSince the phthalates are confounded with methanol, the treatments can be re-characterized as ‘chemical pollution exposure’ versus a ‘control’.\nThe data and code files for this project are organized on GitHub at [https://github.com/sarahtanja/coral-pae-temp]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate\n\n\nTitle\n\n\nAuthor\n\n\nCategories\n\n\nReading Time\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApr 25, 2023\n\n\nDual DNA & RNA Extractions for Montipora capitata coral\n\n\nSarah Tanja\n\n\nlab records\n\n\n24 min\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"

    "text": "After shipping 20 samples to the University of Texas at Austin GSAF for TagSeq on June 7th 2023, I got a message back from them on June 28th 2023:\n\n“Your samples failed in library prep. All 20 of them, the other samples on the 96 well plate as well as our positive control all worked great. We seen this before and it is almost always an indication that there are some type of inhibitors in your samples and it impacted the prep. Based on the quality of the RNA there is nothing more we can do for them, they will not work in the prep until they have been purified, I am not sure how they were cleaned up after the extraction but it needs to be more rigorous and be certain there are no contaminants in the RNA.”\n\nAfter initial panic and frustration 😨😭… I started researching reverse transcriptase1 inhibitors and reaching out to the Roberts and Putnam Labs to ask for advice (recorded in this Roberts Lab github issue).1 Reverse transcriptase is an enzyme that transcribes single-stranded RNA into complementary DNA (cDNA) during library prep for RNA sequencing. It was discovered in the 1970’s by David Baltimore and Howard Temin when studying retroviruses (checkout this YouTube video for a brief history on reverse transcriptase, and this YouTube video for a brief explanation of how it is used to turn mRNA to cDNA).\nSo what did I find, and what does this mean for my samples?\nThe RNA quantity, measured by Qubit Fluorometer, is good. And the RNA quality, measured by UT GSAF Bioanalyzer, is also good. The issue is that there is something else in the sample that is preventing the reverse transcriptase from generating the cDNA."

Any 260/280 protein ratios OVER 2.0 may indicate contamination by phenols, which absorb between 280-300nm wavelengths. So… be suspicious when you see at 260/280 ratio higher than 2.0!\n\n\n\nThe Zymo rep responded with the following advice:\n\n“The guanidine salts in our DNA/RNA Shield and DNA/RNA Lysis Buffer could be the reason of increased A230. We see this happening most often when small impurities (e.g., cell debris, protein aggregation) were transferred from sample processing and got stuck on the column. They would absorb buffers and release them during elution. Ways to avoid this include increasing the amount of DNA/RNA Shield used during processing, reducing sample input, and transferring only a fraction of sample (e.g.,500 µl from 800 µl) from the BashingBead tube to avoid debris. You can also further purify your existing eluted samples with either the RNA Clean & Concentrator that is on the way to you, or by following the”Liquids/Reaction Clean-up” procedure included in the Appendices section Quick-DNA/RNA Miniprep Plus’s protocol.”"

    "text": "“Air temperature and tide data Air temperature and tide level data was obtained from various sources depending on the location. Hourly temperature and tide data for Toke Point and Port Townsend and tide data from Neah Bay and Budd Inlet was obtained from publically available National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) tide station data using the ‘rnoaa’ package in R (Chamberlin et al. 2021, R Core Team 2021). Hourly temperature and tide data for Vancouver and tide data for Pruth Bay was obtained from publically available Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) Canada tide station data. Air temperature data for Pruth Bay was obtained from the Hakai Institute weather station (Giesbrecht et al. 2021). Air temperature data for Neah Bay was obtained from a weather station on nearby Tatoosh Island, WA (C. Pfister and T. Wootton personal communication). Air temperature data for Budd Inlet was obtained from the nearby Evergreen State College weather station. If raw data was reported at time scale less than one hour, mean hourly temperature was calculated. These data can be accessed two ways, both of which are available (Raymond, 2022). There, static data files are archived as well as code to query and process them if necessary. Long term, 1991 – 2020, air temperature data was obtained from the National Aeronautical and Space Agency (NASA) DAYMET surface temperature database using the ‘daymetr’ package in R (Hufkens 2021). We extracted maximum and minimum daily surface air temperatures from 2° latitude by 2° longitude grids. Grids were selected by the location of the hourly temperatures/tide stations above.

    "section": "What are phthalates?",
    "text": "What are phthalates?\nPhthalates are a suite of chemicals that share the base structure of a benzene ring and alkyl chains of varying lengths. They are commonly added to consumer products. Lower molecular weight phthalates are primarily used as solvents in cosmetics while higher molecular weight phthalates are added to plastics like polyvinyl chloride (PVC) to increase flexibility.\n\n“Plasticizers work by reducing the chemical affinity between molecules when embedded between chains of plastic raw materials (or act as monomers in polycarbonate plastic), but as plasticizers are not especially stable in these products, they can leach out and thus end up in the environment. Phthalates are not classified as persistent compounds (Staples et al.1997), but their occurrence in the environment has been reported widely, possibly arguing against a rapid biodegradation in some environments (Fatoki & Vernon 1990; Bauer & Herrmann 1997; Heemken et al. 2001; Fromme et al. 2002; Beauchesne et al.2007)” - Oehlmann et al. (2009)\n\n25 phthalate congeners are currently manufactured\n6 Phthalates identified by the U.S. EPA as priority pollutants:\nDMP (dimethyl phthalate) & DEP (diethyl phthalate)1, BBP (benzyl-butyl phthalate), DBP (dibutyl phthalate), DEHP (diethyl hexyl phthalate), DnOP (di-n-ocytl phthalate)1 water soluble solvents used more in cosmetics than in plastic products\nSince we are starting from the drawing board I’m going to do a quick review of the literature and look for environmental phthalate concentrations found in near-coastal waters, specifically I’m interested in water soluble phthalates like di-methyl phthalate (DMP) and di-ethyl phthlate (DEP). Francesco Saliu suggested we focus on water soluble phthalates in our experimental design so that we don’t have to mess with a carrier solvent control, but can still control the treatments to be within a range of environmental relevance. However, I just learned that “Low molecular weight PAEs such as dimethyl phthalate (DMP), diethyl phthalate (DEP), and DnBP are components of industrial solvents, solvents in perfumes, adhesives, waxes, inks, pharmaceutical products, insecticide materials, and cosmetics (Net et al. 2015)” and that PAEs with longer alkyl chains are used as plasticizers. Since I want to tie my work into marine plastic pollution, I should really focus on common phthalates added to plastics. Unfortunately, it looks like using a water soluble PAE may not be an option.\nIn the table from Net et al. (2015), water solubility (Sw25 ) indicates solubility in mg/L at 25\\(^\\circ\\)C. Notice that it decreases with increasing alkyl length (carbon atom per chain, or carbon chain length).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreater toxicity is associated with shorter alkyl chains\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI learned about the concept of octanol-water partition coefficient (Kow), which is a log value used for “predicting how a chemical will concentrate in marine organisms.” A high value of Kow indicates higher potential bioconcentration in organisms, explained in further detail in Net et al. (2015) and Amézqueta et al. (2020).\n\n\n\nTable 1. from Net et al. 2015\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThe half-life of PAEs decrease with temperature!!!!\nLonger half-lives are more likely under anaerobic conditions and in cold, nutrient poor environments.\nThe half-life of PAEs decrease in the presence of photosensitizers like nitrate, nitrite and chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM)22 CDOM is the fraction of dissolved organic carbon pool that absorbs light in both the ultra violet and visible ranges. It is sometimes called ‘coloured’ dissolved organic matter. The decay of organic matter releases tannins that stain the water, CDOM are the main light-absorbing particles in aquatic systems and estimated to account for 20-70% of dissolved organic carbon in the ocean, with particularly high values of CDOM in coastal zones with heavy terrestrial input (Zhao et al. 2023).\n\n\n\nEven if PAEs can be eliminated from different environmental matrices via various processes as reported in previous sections, their extensive use and permanent emissions have resulted in their ubiquitous presence in the environment.

(2017) that shows a review of papers that report levels of phthalates in marine waters.. however most of the sampling sites are in Europe and the Mediterranean. I’d like to expand on the table to get a better global picture of phthalate pollution levels in coastal marine waters.\nLaw, Fileman, and Matthiessen (1991) conducted sampling around the North and Irish Seas in 1988 and 1989. In this short and sweet report, values are represented as ng/dm3 which is nanograms per cubic decimeter.\n\n“The marine sediments contained about half the concentration as the freshwater lake sediments, but in both matrices DINP had the highest concentrations of all analytes. DINP has been found at higher concentrations than other phthalates in sediments of urban areas, which has been suggested to be due to its higher environmental persistence and rising use following DEHP restrictions (Björklund et al., 2009).” (Mathieu and Bednarek, 2022, p. 23) (Mathieu and Bednarek 2022)"

A measured environmental concentration that exceeds a lowest PNEC is considered by European Union member states to warrant further review for regulatory concern. These values are not considered robust thresholds; rather they are agreed-upon values by NORMAN experts to be used for preliminary prioritization of chemicals. When available, additional thresholds are used in this report, such as the sediment management standards (SMS) values for sediment cleanup objectives (SCO) and cleanup screening levels (CSLs) (Ecology, 2013; WAC 173-204).” (Mathieu and Bednarek 2022)"

We washed glassware with hexane and acetone and ashed it at 440 °C for 2 h before use (Fankhauser-Noti and Grob, 2007). For each individual bird, 3–6 g of muscle sample were homogenized and stored in a glass vial. A Quencher method with primary secondary amine (PSA), Supelclean (Sigma-Aldrich 52738-U), magnesium sulfate, and sodium chloride was used for extracting phthalates from animal tissue. Samples were weighed into 10-mL Kimax glass centrifuge tubes together with a mixture of MgSO4 and NaCl (Martins et al., 2016). One hundred nanograms of the surrogates DMP-d4 and DEHP-d4 and 2 mL of acetonitrile were added to the samples. DMP-d4 and DEHP-d4 are deuterated analogs of two of the targeted compounds in this study, and were utilized as internal standards to maintain precise quantification of phthalates (Net et al., 2015). Samples were then vortexed for 1 min and placed in an ultrasonic bath for 20 min and kept at 4 °C for 24 h to complete the extraction. Next, samples were vortexed for 5 min and centrifuged. The liquid was siphoned off and placed in a second glass culture tube that had been previously filled with MgSO4 and PSA sorbent resin to remove other organic compounds. The mixture was vortexed for 3 min and centrifuged. Next, 0.5 mL of the supernatant liquid was filtered and transferred to a 2-mL autosampler vial with Teflon septa, and internal standards DBP-d4 and DnOP-d4 were added at a concentration of 50 ng/mL.”\n\nAnalytical Method:\n\nHPLC (Agilent 1200) connected to a tandem mass spectrometer (Agilent 6410B) equipped with an ESI source.\nPhase separation was achieved with a Zorbax SB-C18 2.1 to 30 mm, 3.5 mm analytical column and XDB-C18 4.6 to 12.5, 5 mm guard column.\nMobile phases were water (A) and methanol (B) with 10 mM formic acid (B = 25–85% in 5 min, 85–90% in 9 min; B = 90% for 9 min; mass spectrometer settings: gas temperature = 300 °C; gas flow = 6 L/ min; nebulizer = 15 psi; capillary voltage = 4000 V).\nQuality control samples, method blanks, extraction blanks, solvent blanks, instrument blanks, and continuous calibration verification standards were analyzed every 10th sample and sample duplicates were analyzed with every extraction batch (approximately 20 samples).\nIn addition, spiked samples and blanks were carried through the entire extraction procedure to determine method recovery.\nPhthalate concentration was determined using external seven-level calibration using ratios of internal standards and recovery of surrogate was recorded to assure extraction recovery.\nLimit of detection (LOD) was calculated from seven-level calibrations following Harris (2010)\n\nLab: Applied Science, Engineering & Technology (ASET) laboratory, University of Alaska Anchorage\n\nWA Dept. of Ecology Analytical Lab Search\n\nACZ Laboratories, Inc., Steamboat Springs, CO\nGEL Laboratories, LLC., Charleston, SC\nKing County Environmental Laboratory, Seattle, WA\nTacoma Environmental Services Laboratory, Tacoma, WA\nManchester Environmental Laboratories"
