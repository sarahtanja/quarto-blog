    "text": "What are phthalates?\nPhthalates are a suite of chemicals that share the base structure of a benzene ring and alkyl chains of varying lengths. They are commonly added to consumer products. Lower molecular weight phthalates are primarily used as solvents in cosmetics while higher molecular weight phthalates are added to plastics like polyvinyl chloride (PVC) to increase flexibility.\n\n“Plasticizers work by reducing the chemical affinity between molecules when embedded between chains of plastic raw materials (or act as monomers in polycarbonate plastic), but as plasticizers are not especially stable in these products, they can leach out and thus end up in the environment. Phthalates are not classified as persistent compounds (Staples et al.1997), but their occurrence in the environment has been reported widely, possibly arguing against a rapid biodegradation in some environments (Fatoki & Vernon 1990; Bauer & Herrmann 1997; Heemken et al. 2001; Fromme et al. 2002; Beauchesne et al.2007)” - Oehlmann et al. (2009)\n\nOehlmann, Jörg, Ulrike Schulte-Oehlmann, Werner Kloas, Oana Jagnytsch, Ilka Lutz, Kresten O. Kusk, Leah Wollenberger, et al. 2009. “A Critical Analysis of the Biological Impacts of Plasticizers on Wildlife.” Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences 364 (1526): 2047–62. https://doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2008.0242.\n\n25 phthalate congeners are currently manufactured\n6 Phthalates identified by the U.S. EPA as priority pollutants:\nDMP (dimethyl phthalate) & DEP (diethyl phthalate)1, BBP (benzyl-butyl phthalate), DBP (dibutyl phthalate), DEHP (diethyl hexyl phthalate), DnOP (di-n-ocytl phthalate)1 water soluble solvents used more in cosmetics than in plastic products\nSince we are starting from the drawing board I’m going to do a quick review of the literature and look for environmental phthalate concentrations found in near-coastal waters, specifically I’m interested in water soluble phthalates like di-methyl phthalate (DMP) and di-ethyl phthlate (DEP). Francesco Saliu suggested we focus on water soluble phthalates in our experimental design so that we don’t have to mess with a carrier solvent control, but can still control the treatments to be within a range of environmental relevance. However, I just learned that “Low molecular weight PAEs such as dimethyl phthalate (DMP), diethyl phthalate (DEP), and DnBP are components of industrial solvents, solvents in perfumes, adhesives, waxes, inks, pharmaceutical products, insecticide materials, and cosmetics (Net et al. 2015)” and that PAEs with longer alkyl chains are used as plasticizers. Since I want to tie my work into marine plastic pollution, I should really focus on common phthalates added to plastics. Unfortunately, it looks like using a water soluble PAE may not be an option.\nIn the table from Net et al. (2015), water solubility (Sw25 ) indicates solubility in mg/L at 25\\(^\\circ\\)C. Notice that it decreases with increasing alkyl length (carbon atom per chain, or carbon chain length).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreater toxicity is associated with shorter alkyl chains\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI learned about the concept of octanol-water partition coefficient (Kow), which is a log value used for “predicting how a chemical will concentrate in marine organisms.” A high value of Kow indicates higher potential bioconcentration in organisms, explained in further detail in Net et al. (2015) and Amézqueta et al. (2020).\n\nAmézqueta, S., X. Subirats, E. Fuguet, M. Rosés, and C.

Elsevier. https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-816911-7.00006-2.\n\n\n\nTable 1. from Net et al. 2015\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThe half-life of PAEs decrease with temperature!!!!\nLonger half-lives are more likely under anaerobic conditions and in cold, nutrient poor environments.\nThe half-life of PAEs decrease in the presence of photosensitizers like nitrate, nitrite and chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM)2\n\n\n2 CDOM is the fraction of dissolved organic carbon pool that absorbs light in both the ultra violet and visible ranges. It is sometimes called ‘coloured’ dissolved organic matter. The decay of organic matter releases tannins that stain the water, CDOM are the main light-absorbing particles in aquatic systems and estimated to account for 20-70% of dissolved organic carbon in the ocean, with particularly high values of CDOM in coastal zones with heavy terrestrial input (Zhao et al. 2023).\nZhao, Ruoshi, Zhongqiao Li, Aung Aung Aye, Hao Zheng, Weifang Jin, Jingjing Zhang, Feng Zhou, et al. 2023. “Characteristics of Chromophoric Dissolved Organic Matter in the Northern Andaman Sea.” Frontiers in Marine Science 9. https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2022.1043194.\n\nEven if PAEs can be eliminated from different environmental matrices via various processes as reported in previous sections, their extensive use and permanent emissions have resulted in their ubiquitous presence in the environment.

DINP has been found at higher concentrations than other phthalates in sediments of urban areas, which has been suggested to be due to its higher environmental persistence and rising use following DEHP restrictions (Björklund et al., 2009).” (Mathieu and Bednarek, 2022, p. 23) (Mathieu and Bednarek 2022)"

A measured environmental concentration that exceeds a lowest PNEC is considered by European Union member states to warrant further review for regulatory concern. These values are not considered robust thresholds; rather they are agreed-upon values by NORMAN experts to be used for preliminary prioritization of chemicals. When available, additional thresholds are used in this report, such as the sediment management standards (SMS) values for sediment cleanup objectives (SCO) and cleanup screening levels (CSLs) (Ecology, 2013; WAC 173-204).” (Mathieu and Bednarek 2022)"

We washed glassware with hexane and acetone and ashed it at 440 °C for 2 h before use (Fankhauser-Noti and Grob, 2007). For each individual bird, 3–6 g of muscle sample were homogenized and stored in a glass vial. A Quencher method with primary secondary amine (PSA), Supelclean (Sigma-Aldrich 52738-U), magnesium sulfate, and sodium chloride was used for extracting phthalates from animal tissue. Samples were weighed into 10-mL Kimax glass centrifuge tubes together with a mixture of MgSO4 and NaCl (Martins et al., 2016). One hundred nanograms of the surrogates DMP-d4 and DEHP-d4 and 2 mL of acetonitrile were added to the samples. DMP-d4 and DEHP-d4 are deuterated analogs of two of the targeted compounds in this study, and were utilized as internal standards to maintain precise quantification of phthalates (Net et al., 2015). Samples were then vortexed for 1 min and placed in an ultrasonic bath for 20 min and kept at 4 °C for 24 h to complete the extraction. Next, samples were vortexed for 5 min and centrifuged. The liquid was siphoned off and placed in a second glass culture tube that had been previously filled with MgSO4 and PSA sorbent resin to remove other organic compounds. The mixture was vortexed for 3 min and centrifuged. Next, 0.5 mL of the supernatant liquid was filtered and transferred to a 2-mL autosampler vial with Teflon septa, and internal standards DBP-d4 and DnOP-d4 were added at a concentration of 50 ng/mL.”\n\nAnalytical Method:\n\nHPLC (Agilent 1200) connected to a tandem mass spectrometer (Agilent 6410B) equipped with an ESI source.\nPhase separation was achieved with a Zorbax SB-C18 2.1 to 30 mm, 3.5 mm analytical column and XDB-C18 4.6 to 12.5, 5 mm guard column.\nMobile phases were water (A) and methanol (B) with 10 mM formic acid (B = 25–85% in 5 min, 85–90% in 9 min; B = 90% for 9 min; mass spectrometer settings: gas temperature = 300 °C; gas flow = 6 L/ min; nebulizer = 15 psi; capillary voltage = 4000 V).\nQuality control samples, method blanks, extraction blanks, solvent blanks, instrument blanks, and continuous calibration verification standards were analyzed every 10th sample and sample duplicates were analyzed with every extraction batch (approximately 20 samples).\nIn addition, spiked samples and blanks were carried through the entire extraction procedure to determine method recovery.\nPhthalate concentration was determined using external seven-level calibration using ratios of internal standards and recovery of surrogate was recorded to assure extraction recovery.\nLimit of detection (LOD) was calculated from seven-level calibrations following Harris (2010)\n\nLab: Applied Science, Engineering & Technology (ASET) laboratory, University of Alaska Anchorage\n\nWA Dept. of Ecology Analytical Lab Search\n\nACZ Laboratories, Inc., Steamboat Springs, CO\nGEL Laboratories, LLC., Charleston, SC\nKing County Environmental Laboratory, Seattle, WA\nTacoma Environmental Services Laboratory, Tacoma, WA\nManchester Environmental Laboratories"

    "text": "“Air temperature and tide data Air temperature and tide level data was obtained from various sources depending on the location. Hourly temperature and tide data for Toke Point and Port Townsend and tide data from Neah Bay and Budd Inlet was obtained from publically available National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) tide station data using the ‘rnoaa’ package in R (Chamberlin et al. 2021, R Core Team 2021). Hourly temperature and tide data for Vancouver and tide data for Pruth Bay was obtained from publically available Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) Canada tide station data. Air temperature data for Pruth Bay was obtained from the Hakai Institute weather station (Giesbrecht et al. 2021). Air temperature data for Neah Bay was obtained from a weather station on nearby Tatoosh Island, WA (C. Pfister and T. Wootton personal communication). Air temperature data for Budd Inlet was obtained from the nearby Evergreen State College weather station. If raw data was reported at time scale less than one hour, mean hourly temperature was calculated. These data can be accessed two ways, both of which are available (Raymond, 2022). There, static data files are archived as well as code to query and process them if necessary. Long term, 1991 – 2020, air temperature data was obtained from the National Aeronautical and Space Agency (NASA) DAYMET surface temperature database using the ‘daymetr’ package in R (Hufkens 2021). We extracted maximum and minimum daily surface air temperatures from 2° latitude by 2° longitude grids. Grids were selected by the location of the hourly temperatures/tide stations above. These are Toke Point 46.7499° N -124.0250°W, Budd Inlet 47.0643°N -122.9106°W, Neah Bay 48.3770°N -124.6897°W, Port Townsend and Vancouver 48.1172°N -122.7890°W, and Pruth Bay 51.6271°N -127.6450°W.

These samples are ‘snapshots’ of the corals after they were collected from Kaneohe Bay and fragmented to ~3cm nubbins\nModifications incorporated:\n\nAdded 500uL DNA/RNA Shield to bead bashing tube before adding powdered sample\nAfter adding the powdered sample, I added another 1000uL of DNA/RNA Shield and vortexed with a quick pulse to submerge all of the powdered sample\n1Transferred 600uL of supernatent from bead bashing tube to nuclease-free tube after Mortexing, and saved the bead-bashing tube with remaining ~400uL of homogenized tissue in DNA/RNA Shield as backup\nTransferred 350uL of PK Digested sample to a new tube, saved the leftover PK Digested tube sample as backup\nAdded a dry spin for 2min after the last wash buffer spin to ensure complete removal of wash buffer\neluted 270uL of DNA & 60uL RNA in Hyclone nuclease-free water (expired Oct 2021..?)\n\n\n1 Before this extraction, I had been conducted PK Digestion in the bead bashing tube. I got some advice that this could be contaminating the purity of the RNA:\nJerry Yu from Zymo says:\n\n“We are worried about the sample debris remaining in the tube, which should still contain protein. One of the reasons for Proteinase K treatment at this step is to break down protein in the solution to make it less viscous/sticky, so the column can process it without issue. By transferring the mixture out, the treatment could be more efficient.”\n\n2 Kind of arbitrary.. trying to hit something between 100 and 50 microliters"

Half remains in the freezer.\n3-Ea pestled 2nd, all of the material in the cryo vial was used, but half fell on the floor and had to be thrown out.\nLN2 evaporates very quickly and had to be replenished multiple times\nWe did this with two people (NAH to grind, SST to carefully dispense LN2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nThe coral is very hard to pestle and prone to ‘squirting out’ from under the pestle! Learned that it is better to leverage whole body weight above the mortar and work to crush the coral fragment like a hydraulic press. When pestling sample 3-Ea at an angle, half of the fragment shot out of the mortar and ended up on the floor (which was discarded and not used), resulting in less starting material left to use in the mortar. This could be a reason why 3-Ea had ‘out of range, too low’ result for Qubit!\n\n\n\nUsed sterilized scoopula to transfer the sample powder to its correspondingly labelled bead bashing tube.\n\nFor this step we made small disposable funnels from lab weigh-paper and label tape to try and make this easier. ⚠️Unfortunately, this didn’t work very well! ⚠️ Finely ground powder melts fast and the cold from the LN2 means that all the moisture in the lab is condensing on the sample. As soon as it is removed from the mortar by the scoopula it begins to melt , condense water vapor, and turn into a sticky booger! It doesn’t slide nice and dry down the paper funnel. We had to tamp it vigorously to get it into the bead bashing tube.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nFixed the melting booger problem by getting small metal funnels and metal scoopulas and chilling them on dry-ice, with the goal being to keep the powder cold during the transfer from the mortar to inside the bead bashing tube. This worked really well!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfunnel weigh paper diagram\n\n\n\nOnce the sample powder was in the bead bashing tube, we quickly added 750uL of DNA/RNA Sheild to the bead bashing tube, shook it vigorously & vortexed it to ensure the sample was submersed in DNA/RNA Sheild\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nAfter bead beating tube was very very bubbly! Would suggest centrifuging after the bead-beating homogenization ‘shaker’ step prior to opening tube lid and putting it in the bead bashing tube before the sample in future extractions.\n\n\n\nWe then set bead-bashing tubes in the Mortexer and let it mix at max speed for 40 mins\nAdded 30uL of Proteinase-K Digestion Buffer directly to the bead bashing tube\nAdded 15uL of Proteinase-K directly to the bead bashing tube\nIncubated (left to sit) at room temp for 30 minutes\neluted 100ul of DNA in nuclease-free water\neluted 100ul of RNA in nuclease-free water"

The overarching goal was to have a comprehensive checklist for sleep-deprived scientists to follow after 3 days of pulling nearly all-nighters to collect Montipora capitata egg-sperm bundles, conduct bundle-bundle cross fertilizations in 20mL scintillation vials, and then subsequently “Fix and Freeze” the embryos at 4 hours post fertilization (4hpf) when fertilized eggs should be reaching initial cleavage, 9hpf when embryos should be in the ‘prawn chip’ phase, and 14hpf when embryos should be in the early gastrula phase. The end goal is to see if low levels of PVC leachate (PVC having notably larger amounts of phthalates which are known endocrine disrupting chemicals) negatively impact fertilization success and embryonic development of Montipora capitata embryos."

    "text": "Dilute ZFIX\nTo preserve embryos for confocal microscope imaging, and visual determination of developmental stage, we have to preserve the embryo tissue and keep it from disintegrating, bursting, shredding… etc. To do that we can use ZFIX (zinc buffered formalin). There is a wide range (4-20%!) reported in the literature of ZFIX or paraformaldehye concentrations used for tissue preservation. We chose to work with 4% ZFIX. Some constraints we took into account are that FedEx will let you ship any volume of formalin as long as it’s below 10% concentration, and the less concentrated… the ‘safest’ it is for us to handle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nAlways handle ZFIX, formalin, paraformaldehyde, etc. in a fume hood, or a place with adequate ventilation (outside, with a stiff breeze, no huffing).\n\n\nHere we are going from ZFIX concentrate of 18.5% to a diluted 4% in a ~100mL final volume!\n0.185 * V1 = 0.04 * 100mL\nV1 = 21.62mL\nTo get 100mL of 4% ZFIX we: Added 21.62 mL of 18.5% ZFIX to 78.38mL of (0.22micron) filtered sea water\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nJill Ashey (personal communication) says it’s important to use FSW to dilute your ZFIX! This is for long-term storage (up to 6 months) of embryos in anywhere from 4-20% ZFIX or paraformaldehyde (PFA) … the FSW may keep your embryos from lysing so that you can preserve their integrity for microscopy. If using DI or Milli-Q water, there is a chance that the embryos become ‘shriveled’. This being said… we used Milli-Q water for crosses 1-5 (before learning that FSW is best), and checked them after 48 hours. They looked perfectly preserved! We kept them in ~500uL of 4% ZFIX in micro-centrifuge tubes at 4C."

    "text": "Bundle-Bundle Crosses\nTo conduct bundle-bundle crosses use transfer pipettes to take one intact bundle from each of two genetically distinct parent colonies, and pop them into a single 20mL scintillation vial loaded with the treatment condition of the assay. In this case, each scintillation vial either had only 22 micron filtered seawater (control - 0 mg/L PVC leachate), a low environmental dose (low - 0.01 mg/L PVC leachate), a mid dose (mid - 0.1 mg/L PVC leachate), or a high dose (1mg/L PVC leachate). Each ‘n’ set of treatments, embryonic phases, and sample types (microscopy and molecular) should try to have the same genetic cross (aka same set of parent colonies).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nTwice (once attempting this in 2022, and once in 2024) I noticed poor viability and cross-fertilization success when attempting to cross Montipora capitata colonies that are growing on the Padilla-Gamino Lab “racks”… these colonies have been growing in proximity to each other since 2017. Crosses between “rack” colonies and “wild” colonies, as well as “wild-wild” crosses seem fine… but here, we avoided “rack-rack” colony crosses, as they proved to result in poor fertilization success.\n\n\nAs soon as bundles begin to hydrate and ‘break-up’, the ability to do bundle-bundle crosses ends. This gives you a very short (1 hour!) window, as spawning typically starts around ~8:45 - 9:15 PM, and bundles begin hydrating and breaking up ~10:00 - 10:40 PM. we found that a single person can feasibly cross 120 scintillation vials in this timeframe. In our experimental design, that translates to an ‘n’ of 5, or 5 ‘crosses’ each night of spawning."

Our chemical analyses show that leachates from beached pellets (biobead and nurdle pellets) and highly plasticised industrial pellets (PVC) contain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and polychlorinated biphenyls, which are known to be detrimental to development and other life stages of animals. We also demonstrate that these microplastic leachates elicit severe, consistent and treatment-specific developmental abnormalities in P. lividus at embryonic and larval stages. Those embryos exposed to virgin polyethylene leachates with no additives nor environmental contaminants developed normally, suggesting that the abnormalities observed are the result of exposure to either environmentally adsorbed contaminants or pre-existing industrial additives within the polymer matrix. In the light of the chemical contents of the leachates and other characteristics of the plastic particles used, we discuss the phenotypes observed during our study, which include abnormal gastrulation, impaired skeletogenesis, abnormal neurogenesis, redistribution of pigmented cells and embryo radialisation (rendell-bhatti2021?).\n\nThis study used the same leachate preparation and concentrations as above."

Fertilized eggs were exposed to environmental and high PAE concentrations for 72 h. The potential toxic effects on larval development and any morphological anomalies were then assessed to estimate PAEs impact. Environmental concentrations never affected development, while high concentrations induced toxic effects in larvae exposed to BBP (EC50: 2.9 ×103 μg/L) and DEHP (EC50: 3.72 ×103 μg/L). High concentrations caused skeletal anomalies, with a slight to moderate impact for DEP/DEHP and BBP, respectively. PAE toxicity was: BBP&gt;DEHP&gt;DEP. In conclusion, the three PAEs at environmental concentrations do not pose a risk to sea urchins. However, PAE concentrations should be further monitored in order not to constitute a concern to marine species, especially at their early developmental stages. - (gambardella2024?)"

We observed that mussel embryo is sensitive to leachate from both virgin and beached pellets. However, the toxicity of the leachate from beached pellets was much higher than that of virgin pellets. We suggest contaminants adsorbed onto the surface of beached pellets were responsible for the high toxicity of leachate from beached pellets, while the toxicity of leachate from virgin pellets was mainly due to plastic additives.

In this study, blue mussels were exposed for seven days to both single and combined stressors (i.e., +3 ◦C elevated temperature and two environmentally relevant concentrations of the plastic softener DEHP, 0.5 and 50 μg/l) in a factorial design. Males were observed to be more sensitive to high temperature, demonstrated by the significant increase in out-of-season spawning gonads and higher gene expression of the antioxidant catalase and the estrogen receptor genes. On the other hand, while the gametogenesis cycle in females was more resilient than in males, DEHP exposure altered the estrogen-related receptor gene expression. We show that the combined stressors DEHP and increased temperature, in environmentally relevant magnitudes, have different consequences in male and female mussels, with the potential to impact the timing and breeding season success in Mytilus spp. - (mincarelli2021?)"

    "text": "Plastic leachate-induced toxicity during sea urchin embryonic development: Insights into the molecular pathways affected by PVC\n\nHere we investigate the effects of leachates from new and beach-collected pellets on the embryonic and larval development of the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus and demonstrate that exposure of developing embryos to these leachates elicits severe, consistent and treatment-specific developmental abnormalities including radialisation of the embryo and malformation of the skeleton, neural and immune cells. Using a multi-omics approach we define the developmental pathways disturbed upon exposure to PVC leachates and provide a mechanistic view that pinpoints cellular redox stress and energy production as drivers of phenotypic abnormalities following exposure to PVC leachates. Analysis of leachates identified high concentrations of zinc that are the likely cause of these observed defects. Our findings point to clear and specific detrimental effects of marine plastic pollution on the development of echinoderms, demonstrating that chemicals leached from plastic particles into sea water can produce strong developmental abnormalities via specific pathways, and therefore have the potential to impact on a wide range of organisms. -(paganos2023a?) (Abstract)\n\n\nused nurdle beach pellets collected from Cornwall, UK & pre-production commercial PVC nurdles\n\n\nThese results are consistent with those observed previously in P. lividus, where beached and PVC pellet leachates elicited changes including abnormal gastrulation, impaired skeletogenesis, abnormal neurogenesis and embryo radialisation (Rendell-Bhatti et al., 2020), indicating that these types of developmental abnormalities may not be species-specific but affect the whole clade similarly. The PVC treatment-induced phenotype was of particular interest as it clearly resembles the one obtained when the specification of the secondary axis of the sea urchin embryo (oral-aboral) is disturbed. Similar to our P. lividus data (Rendell-Bhatti et al., 2020), embryos exposed to PVC leachates are unable to produce a proper skeleton. In normal gastrula embryos, skeletogenic cells are spatially organised around the archenteron, forming a syncytium to which biominerals are deposited (Fig. 2. E). At the pluteus stage, the larval skeleton consists of different skeletal rods that are responsible for the characteristic shape of the larvae (Fig. 2. F). PVC leachate-treated S. purpuratus gastrulae seem to be missing differentiated skeletogenic cells as indicated by the absence of the skeletal marker MSP130 immunoreactivity (Fig. 2. I), while the same marker at 72 hpf reveals the presence of radialised syncytium of differentiated skeletogenic cells (Fig. 2. J). Another visible abnormality of the treated larvae is the absence of a well-formed ciliary band, an observation confirmed by the β-tubulin staining showing a reduced ciliary surface when compared to controls (Fig. 2. G, H). Esophageal muscles originate from myoblasts that at gastrula stage populate the tip of the embryonic foregut and at the pluteus stage they differentiate towards circumesophageal muscles controlling the contraction of the sea urchin esophageal region and therefore feeding (Andrikou et al., 2013, 2015). Immunohistochemical staining for the esophageal muscles marker Sp-MHC revealed that exogastrulated larvae are lacking any muscular structure suggesting that exogastrulation impaired muscle development (Fig. 2. K, L). In the Rendell-Bhatti et al. (2020) study we found PCB and PAH in the leachates of environmental samples, and PAH and HCB in PVC leachates, which we suggested were the possible causes of the malformations observed (Rendell-Bhatti et al., 2020). We had not observed exogastrulas before, but another study had found otherwise well-formed P. lividus pluteus larvae with everted gut rudiments when exposed to micronized plastic toys (Oliviero et al., 2019). However, the phenotypes here observed in the PVC treatments clearly mirror phenotypes from classical and new experiments exposing S. purpuratus and other sea urchins to heavy metals (Mitsunaga and Yasumasu, 1984; Kobayashi and Okamura, 2004; Cunningham et al., 2020), as well as to oral-aboral axis formation disorganisation (Duboc et al., 2004). Indeed, we see radialised/oralised embryos similar to those described when the developmental pathways involved in oral/aboral (O/A) and left/right (L/R) axis formation are disrupted (Duboc et al., 2004, 2008). These results prompted us to investigate what transcriptomic changes were taking place in the embryos to be able to identify the mechanisms by which the plastic leachates were affecting development. -(paganos2023a?)\n\n\ndisturbs differentiation of skeletogenic cells\ndisturbs formation of ciliary band, esophageal region for feeding\ndisturbs oral-aboral & left-right axis formation\nmirrors effects of exposure to heavy metal, esp. zinc\n\n\n“down-regulated genes represented &gt;75 % of the differentially expressed genes (86 % at 48 hpf and 77 % at 72 hpf) suggesting that the effect by PVC leachates is of repressive nature, leading to a developmental program failure” -(paganos2023a?)\n\n\nTo analyse what type of processes are altered in the treated embryos we performed a gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis using ShinyGO 0.76 platform (Ge et al., 2020) followed by REVIGO (Supek et al., 2011) to reduce redundant terms and visualise the data, separately for up- and down-regulated genes and each time point. -(paganos2023a?)\n\n\nMore downregulated genes than upregulated\n\nOverrepresented GO terms for both up and down regulated genes\nAt 48hpf:\n- detection and response to stimuli\n- signaling pathways\n- development and developmental processes\n- metabolic and biosynthetic processes\n- regulation of processes and transport\nAt 72 hpf:\n- metabolic processes\n- regulation and development\n\nMoreover, for up-regulated genes we see response to external stimuli and cell organisation GO terms overrepresented, while for down-regulated genes we find signaling pathways and transport overrepresented. -(paganos2023a?)"

    "text": "Transcriptional responses of Acropora hyacinthus embryo under the benzo(a)pyrene stress by deep sequencing\n\nAbstract\nCoral embryos are a critical and sensitive period for the early growth and development of coral. Benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) is widely distributed in the ocean and has strong toxicity, but there is little information on the toxic effects to coral embryos exposed to this widespread environmental contaminant. Thus, in this study, we utilized the Illumina Hiseq™ 4000 platform to explore the gene response of Acropora hyacinthus embryos under the BaP stress. A total of 130,042 Unigenes were obtained and analyzed, and approximately 37.67% of those matched with sequences from four different species. In total, 2606 Unigenes were up-regulated, and 3872 Unigenes were down-regulated. After Gene Ontology (GO) annotation, the results show that the “cellular process” and “metabolic process” were leading in the category of biological processes, which the “binding” and “catalytic activity” were the most abundant subcategories in molecular function. Based on the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis, the most differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were enriched, as well as down-regulated in the pathways of oxidative phosphorylation, metabolism of xenobiotics, immune-related genes, apoptosis and human disease genes. At the same time, 388,197 of Single-nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) and 6164 of Simple Sequence Repeats (SSRs) were obtained, which can be served as the richer and more valuable SSRs molecular markers in the future. The results of this study can help to better understand the toxicological mechanism of coral embryo exposed to BaP, and it is also essential for the protection and restoration of coral reef ecosystem in the future."

In the first batch, 7 out of 20 samples were ‘off’ of the target concentration of 25ng/uL by enough to make me want to redo them (one was way high at 230ng/uL, others were too low at ~10ng/uL)\nI first re-ran the qubit (2nd qubit run) and got really poor results, with all the rerun samples too-low, (even the one that was previously 230ng/uL!?)\nI then re-normalized the samples and ran them on qubit again (3rd qubit run). In this run 4-PH1b hit the target, the rest were still too low\nI re-normalized the samples for a third time (with some increasing concentration modifications) and ran them on qubit for a 4th time. In this run 4-PA2a hit the target, the rest were still too low, and 2-PH2a even got worse despite increasing concentration.\nEnded the day unsatisfied with the following samples too low for normalization despite 4 attempts:\n\n2-PH2a - too low\n2-CA2a - 15.0, 15.4\n1-PA2a - 10.2, 10.0\n1-PH1a - 17.6, 17.6\n3-CH2a - 15.0, 14.6\n4-CA1a - 14.0, 13.0\n\n\n\n\n02-JUN-2023\n\nNormalized DNA (still have RNA left to do)\nTested normalized DNA on Qubit BR DNA assay, results overall were good but a smidge lower than my goal\nblank + microbial standard extraction\n\n\n\n01-JUN-2023\n\nPresented Bioinformatics final project for FISH 546\nAttended GSR Meeting\nAttended Seminar/TGIT"

The reason for this is that the NanoDrop will almost always over-“calculate” your sample concentrations (both RNA and DNA). The reason for this is that the NanoDrop is a spectrophotometer and measures light absorbance. With almost all DNA/RNA isolations, there will be residual DNA or RNA in your sample. The NanoDrop cannot distinguish between the two molecules, because they’re both made up of the same material; nucleotides. Nucleotides, regardless of their of their origin will absorb light at an average wavelength of 260nm.Since the Qubit assays use molecule-specific dyes, the dye will only bind to DNA or only to RNA. The dyes will not bind to any carryover of other types of molecules in the sample, so the accuracy (and sensitivity) is much, much higher than the NanoDrop.\n\n\n\n\n21-APR-2023\n\nmet with JPG April 1on1\n\ntalked about travel from Sept. 12 - Oct 9th, missing first 2 weeks of Autumn ’23 quarter, focusing that quarter on writing & analysis\nGOAL: have all sequences (16S & Transcriptomes) by September 1st 2023\nInitial 20 samples extracted & sent for sequencing before FHL\n2nd committee meeting to be held once initial 20 samples are run through 1st analysis for 16S & DGE, get advice on strategy for selecting remaining samples\nFollow-up samples extracted & sent for sequencing in July/August\nSend draft letter for NAH experiential learning fund to JPG on Monday April 24th\n\nInitial test round 2 samples extracted!!!\n\n3-CA1a\n3-Ea\n\nSampes selected from extr1 using a random number generator\ndetails can be found in the coral-DNA-RNA-lab-extractions repository\n\n\n\n\n\n20-APR-2023\n\ndownloaded fastq files for ‘fake data’ to continue script for bioinformatics workflow\nReceived Mortexer!

This is the beginning of my exploration of using GitHub to jot down thoughts, record ‘daily bits’, and organize the procedures and methods I’ll use in my thesis research\nzbengt introduced me to ‘elicit’, a lit review search AI. I searched “What is the role of endocrine signaling in cnidarian development” and found an exciting paper titled “Sea Anemones Responding to Sex Hormones, Oxybenzone, and Benzyl Butyl Phthalate: Transcriptional Profiling and in Silico Modelling Provide Clues to Decipher Endocrine Disruption in Cnidarians” authored by Morgan et al. in 2022\nI explored another AI, ChatGPT, and gave it the prompt “write me a poem about corals and oysters and mothers” and it returned:\n\n\nCoral reefs, a vibrant sea of life, A home for countless creatures, rife. Oysters, clams, and mussels too, All nestled safe, their shells in view.\nBut danger lurks, the waters warm, The coral bleaches, it’s colors torn. Mother Nature’s wrath, a sight to see, But we can help, if only we believe.\nFor mothers, fierce and loving beasts, Will do what it takes, to protect at least. Their young and home, with all their might, They’ll fight and strive, through day and night.\nSo let us join, in their noble quest, To save the reefs, and all the rest. For oysters, corals, and mothers too, Deserve a chance, to make it through.\n\n\nI followed up with a ChatGPT prompt “what are examples of endocrine signaling in cnidarians?” and it returned:\n\n\nEndocrine signaling is the process of communicating information from one cell to another by releasing hormones into the circulatory system or through direct contact. In cnidarians, endocrine signaling can be used for a variety of functions, including the regulation of growth, development, and behavior.\nOne example of endocrine signaling in cnidarians is the release of growth hormones, which stimulate the growth and development of cells and tissues. For example, in some species of cnidarians, the release of growth hormones is regulated by the action of a hormone called insulin-like growth factor (IGF).\nAnother example of endocrine signaling in cnidarians is the regulation of reproductive function. In some species of cnidarians, hormones called gonadotropins are released by the endocrine cells of the gonads (sex organs) to stimulate the production and release of gametes (sex cells).\nEndocrine signaling is also involved in the regulation of behavior in cnidarians. For example, some species of cnidarians release hormones called neuropeptides that act on the nervous system to regulate behaviors such as feeding, movement, and response to stimuli.\nOverall, endocrine signaling plays a vital role in the regulation of various functions in cnidarians, including growth, development, and behavior.\n\n\n\n​**Is this is all true!? I’ll have to follow-up with my own dive into primary literature…\n\nAnother ChatGPT AI response, when asked the same questions, but prompted to provide references:\n\n\nExamples of endocrine signaling in cnidarians include the release of hormones in response to stimuli such as touch, temperature changes, and changes in light intensity.\nFor example, the hormone adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (ACAP) is released from cnidocytes in response to a variety of stimuli and activates adenylate cyclase, leading to the production of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and the regulation of various physiological processes.\nOther signaling molecules that have been identified in cnidarians include cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), inositol triphosphate (IP3), and Ca2+-dependent signaling pathways.\nReferences:\nLevitan, D. R., & Kohn, A. B. (2001). The Endocrine System of Cnidarians. Annual Review of Physiology, 63(1), 319-344.\nSchmid, V., & Pfründner, R. (1995).

    "text": "What information can we get from looking at the Montipora capitata embryos that were exposed to varying levels of PVC leachate (High: 1mg/L, Mid: 0.1mg/L, Low: 0.01mg/L)? This experiment allowed embryos to develop from a bundle-bundle cross (meaning one egg-sperm bundle from one parent colony was placed in a 20mL scintillation vial with another egg-sperm bundle from a different parent colony). Colonies are not known to be able to self-fertilize… meaning it’s important that each bundle came from a different parent colony. Each Montipora capitata egg sperm bundle contains a ‘bundle’ of eggs that are bound together around a ‘packet’ of sperm.\nEach egg-sperm bundle contains 15 +/- 5.1 oocytes (mean +/- SD, n = 214, from 26 colonies) (Padilla-Gamiño et al. 2011)\n\nPadilla-Gamiño, J. L., T. M. Weatherby, R. G. Waller, and R. D. Gates. 2011. “Formation and Structural Organization of the Egg–Sperm Bundle of the Scleractinian Coral Montipora Capitata.” Coral Reefs 30 (2): 371–80. https://doi.org/10.1007/s00338-010-0700-8.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis means that each bundle-bundle cross, if there was 100% fertilization success, should result in anywhere from ~18 to ~42 maturing embryos.\nQuestion # 1: Do we use 100% fertilization success as our ‘baseline’ to compare all treatment groups (including the control?). This could provide insight into fertilization success ratios for bundle-bundle cross experiments, but may not be applicable to oceanic conditions, where there is sperm competition, mixing, and greater potential for dilution\nAnswer: We will only assess fertilization success at the point of cleavage, where presumably, we will still see the unfertilized oocytes (any eggs that have not cleaved). In the prawn chip and early gastrula phases, the unfertilized eggs have already dissolved. In these phases, we will assess embryo mortality based on the fertilization rates we find from the cleavage data.\n\n\n\nCleavage\n\n\nPrawn chip\n\n\n\n2x Nikon scope image of sample 8M9 | cross 8, Mid PVC treatment 0.1mg/L, 9 hours post fertilization (prawn chip phase)\n\n\n\n\nEarly gastrula\n\n\n\n4x Nikon scope image of sample 6L14 (cross 6, Low PVC treatment 0.01mg/L, 14 hours post fertilization (early gastrula phase))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nQuestion #2: How should we treat fragmented embryos? I can tell by the cell structure that they made it to a certain phase… but I can’t tell how many fragments make up one whole embryo (count data). Should we not the fragmented embryos? Are they fragmented, or are they deformed (abnormalities?)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvariable\nunit/type\nstatistical test\n\n\n\n\nembryo size\nmicrons, continuous variable\nOne-Way ANOVA\n\n\nembryo stage\ncell stage, ordinal categorical variable\nChi-Square Goodness of Fit or Log-Likelihood Ratio\n\n\nproportion of abnormality per cross\nratio, continuous variable\nLog-Likelihood Ratio\n\n\nproportion of abnormality per treatment\nratio, continuous variable\nLog-Likelihood Ratio\n\n\nproportion of fertilization success\nratio, continuous variable\nLog-Likelihood Ratio\n\n\n\n\nIf you take pics of X random embryos for every cross, you can get:\n\nEmbryo size (unit: microns/mm, continuous variable)\nEmbryo stage (cell stage, ordinal categorical variable)\nAbnormality (yes/no, binary categorical variable)\nProportion of abnormality per cross (ratios, continuous variable), which you can use to obtain % abnormality per treatment\n\nYou can also assess\n\nFertilization success (yes/no per cross, binary categorical variable)\nFertilization success (proportion per treatment, ratios, continuous variable)\n\nHow have others measured fertilization success in Montipora capitata?\n\n\nAssessing fertilization success of the coral Montipora capitata under copper exposure: Does the night of spawning matter?(hedouin_assessing_2013?)\n\nonly looked at initial cleavage (3 hpf)\nbundle-bundle cross in 10mL of 0.45um FSW\n\n\n” After preservation, eggs were examined for the fertilization (showing normal cleavage) and the proportion of successful fertilization within treatment determined. Eggs showing no signs of cleavage were scored as unfertilized. \nThe proportions of fertilized eggs were used to estimate EC50, the concentration of copper that reduced the fertilization success rate by 50%, relative to untreated controls using R 2.11© software. A general model fitting function for concentration/dose response models was applied using the package drc from R 2.11© software and the EC50, EC20 and EC10 calculated. After transformation, data on fertilization success (%) were analyzed using one-way ANOVA and post hoc Tukey comparisons to detect any significant differences (p &lt; 0.05) among the treatments. One-way ANOVA and post hoc Tukey comparisons were also used to determine significant differences in eggs per bundle and egg size among the different spawning times.\nThe fertilization rates in the untreated controls were relatively high for all the experiments, ranging from 86% to 96% (Fig. 1), with the exception of the last experiment performed on August 1st, 2008, where almost no fertilization (&lt;10%) was observed in either control and experimental vials. ”\n\n\n\nEffects of Toxic Compounds in Montipora capitata on Exogenous and Endogenous Zooxanthellae Performance and Fertilization Success(hagedorn_effects_2015?)\n\n“Fertilization success using untreated sperm was 79 ± 4% SEM, whereas the success rate dropped significantly after exposure to the crushed eggs, 1.3 ± 0% SEM. Unlike the eggs and the larvae, M. capitata sperm did not reduce the photosynthetic competency of P. compressa zooxanthellae, suggesting the sperm was nontoxic.”\n\n\n\nEnergetics, but not development, is impacted in coral embryos exposed to ocean acidification (Chille et al. 2022)\n\nChille, E. E., E. L. Strand, F. Scucchia, M. Neder, V. Schmidt, M. O. Sherman, T. Mass, and H. M. Putnam. 2022. “Energetics, but Not Development, Is Impacted in Coral Embryos Exposed to Ocean Acidification.” Journal of Experimental Biology 225 (19): jeb243187. https://doi.org/10.1242/jeb.243187.\n\n“All statistical analyses for morphological data were performed in RStudio (v1.3.959; https://www.rstudio.com/), using R version 4.0.2 (https://www-r-project-org.offcampus.lib.washington.edu/). A beta regression model (formula=proportion∼cleavage stage+treatment+cleavage stage:treatment) was used to analyze differences in the proportion of cells at each cleavage stage and treatment using the betareg R package (v3.1-4; Cribari-Neto and Zeileis, 2010). Differences between cleavage stages and treatments were then computed using the joint_tests function from the emmeans R package (v1.4.4; https://cran-r-project-org.offcampus.lib.washington.edu/package=emmeans), which effectively runs the beta regression model as a type III ANOVA. Additionally, a one-way nested ANOVA analysis tested the effect of tank on embryo and planula size wherein tank ID was nested within treatment. After determining that tank effects were non-significant (P&gt;0.05), one-way ANOVA analysis was used to test for the effect of treatment on fertilized embryo, gastrula and planula volume. Post hoc Tukey HSD tests were conducted when the effect of treatment was significant (P&lt;0.05). Data were visually examined for normal distribution and equal variance. The dependent variable was square-root transformed for the gastrulation and planula life stages in order to meet statistical assumptions prior to ANOVA analysis. Data points for these life stages were back-transformed for visualization in Fig. 2.”"

Any 260/280 protein ratios OVER 2.0 may indicate contamination by phenols, which absorb between 280-300nm wavelengths. So… be suspicious when you see at 260/280 ratio higher than 2.0!\n\n\n\nThe Zymo rep responded with the following advice:\n\n“The guanidine salts in our DNA/RNA Shield and DNA/RNA Lysis Buffer could be the reason of increased A230. We see this happening most often when small impurities (e.g., cell debris, protein aggregation) were transferred from sample processing and got stuck on the column. They would absorb buffers and release them during elution. Ways to avoid this include increasing the amount of DNA/RNA Shield used during processing, reducing sample input, and transferring only a fraction of sample (e.g.,500 µl from 800 µl) from the BashingBead tube to avoid debris. You can also further purify your existing eluted samples with either the RNA Clean & Concentrator that is on the way to you, or by following the”Liquids/Reaction Clean-up” procedure included in the Appendices section Quick-DNA/RNA Miniprep Plus’s protocol.”"

This ensures that no matter where the .qmd file is located within subdirectories, it will always find references.bib at the project root.\n\nExample Project Structure\n{C:\\Users\\Minerva\\Documents\\GitHub\\quarto-blog\\} │-- _quarto.yml │-- references.bib │-- index.qmd │-- posts\\ │   ├── post1\\ │   │   ├── analysis.qmd  &lt;-- This can still find references.bib! │   ├── post2\\ │-- styles\\\nEven if analysis.qmd is inside a nested folder (posts/post1/), using\nbibliography: {project}/references.bib\nwill always point to C:\\Users\\Minerva\\Documents\\GitHub\\quarto-blog\\references.bib.\nWhy This Is Better\n✅ No need for absolute paths\n✅ Works across different systems (Windows, macOS, Linux)\n✅ More flexible than using ../../ for relative paths"
