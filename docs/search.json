These samples are ‘snapshots’ of the corals after they were collected from Kaneohe Bay and fragmented to ~3cm nubbins\nModifications incorporated:\n\nAdded 500uL DNA/RNA Shield to bead bashing tube before adding powdered sample\nAfter adding the powdered sample, I added another 1000uL of DNA/RNA Shield and vortexed with a quick pulse to submerge all of the powdered sample\n1Transferred 600uL of supernatent from bead bashing tube to nuclease-free tube after Mortexing, and saved the bead-bashing tube with remaining ~400uL of homogenized tissue in DNA/RNA Shield as backup\nTransferred 350uL of PK Digested sample to a new tube, saved the leftover PK Digested tube sample as backup\nAdded a dry spin for 2min after the last wash buffer spin to ensure complete removal of wash buffer\neluted 270uL of DNA & 60uL RNA in Hyclone nuclease-free water (expired Oct 2021..?)\n\n\n1 Before this extraction, I had been conducted PK Digestion in the bead bashing tube. I got some advice that this could be contaminating the purity of the RNA:\nJerry Yu from Zymo says:\n\n“We are worried about the sample debris remaining in the tube, which should still contain protein. One of the reasons for Proteinase K treatment at this step is to break down protein in the solution to make it less viscous/sticky, so the column can process it without issue. By transferring the mixture out, the treatment could be more efficient.”\n\n2 Kind of arbitrary.. trying to hit something between 100 and 50 microliters"

Half remains in the freezer.\n3-Ea pestled 2nd, all of the material in the cryo vial was used, but half fell on the floor and had to be thrown out.\nLN2 evaporates very quickly and had to be replenished multiple times\nWe did this with two people (NAH to grind, SST to carefully dispense LN2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nThe coral is very hard to pestle and prone to ‘squirting out’ from under the pestle! Learned that it is better to leverage whole body weight above the mortar and work to crush the coral fragment like a hydraulic press. When pestling sample 3-Ea at an angle, half of the fragment shot out of the mortar and ended up on the floor (which was discarded and not used), resulting in less starting material left to use in the mortar. This could be a reason why 3-Ea had ‘out of range, too low’ result for Qubit!\n\n\n\nUsed sterilized scoopula to transfer the sample powder to its correspondingly labelled bead bashing tube.\n\nFor this step we made small disposable funnels from lab weigh-paper and label tape to try and make this easier. ⚠️Unfortunately, this didn’t work very well! ⚠️ Finely ground powder melts fast and the cold from the LN2 means that all the moisture in the lab is condensing on the sample. As soon as it is removed from the mortar by the scoopula it begins to melt , condense water vapor, and turn into a sticky booger! It doesn’t slide nice and dry down the paper funnel. We had to tamp it vigorously to get it into the bead bashing tube.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nFixed the melting booger problem by getting small metal funnels and metal scoopulas and chilling them on dry-ice, with the goal being to keep the powder cold during the transfer from the mortar to inside the bead bashing tube. This worked really well!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfunnel weigh paper diagram\n\n\n\nOnce the sample powder was in the bead bashing tube, we quickly added 750uL of DNA/RNA Sheild to the bead bashing tube, shook it vigorously & vortexed it to ensure the sample was submersed in DNA/RNA Sheild\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nAfter bead beating tube was very very bubbly! Would suggest centrifuging after the bead-beating homogenization ‘shaker’ step prior to opening tube lid and putting it in the bead bashing tube before the sample in future extractions.\n\n\n\nWe then set bead-bashing tubes in the Mortexer and let it mix at max speed for 40 mins\nAdded 30uL of Proteinase-K Digestion Buffer directly to the bead bashing tube\nAdded 15uL of Proteinase-K directly to the bead bashing tube\nIncubated (left to sit) at room temp for 30 minutes\neluted 100ul of DNA in nuclease-free water\neluted 100ul of RNA in nuclease-free water"

Unfortunately, in this pilot experiment, we lack a methanol solvent control. This means that we cannot differentiate the effects of the phthalate pollutants from the effects of the methanol on the microbial community changes when compared to the no-pollution controls.\nHowever, this project and the data can be used as a ‘practice set’ for developing microbiome analysis pipelines and figures.\nSince the phthalates are confounded with methanol, the treatments can be re-characterized as ‘chemical pollution exposure’ versus a ‘control’.\nThe data and code files for this project are organized on GitHub at [https://github.com/sarahtanja/coral-pae-temp]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate\n\n\nTitle\n\n\nAuthor\n\n\nCategories\n\n\nReading Time\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApr 25, 2023\n\n\nDual DNA & RNA Extractions for Montipora capitata coral\n\n\nSarah Tanja\n\n\nlab records\n\n\n24 min\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"

All 20 of them, the other samples on the 96 well plate as well as our positive control all worked great. We seen this before and it is almost always an indication that there are some type of inhibitors in your samples and it impacted the prep. Based on the quality of the RNA there is nothing more we can do for them, they will not work in the prep until they have been purified, I am not sure how they were cleaned up after the extraction but it needs to be more rigorous and be certain there are no contaminants in the RNA.”\n\nAfter initial panic and frustration 😨😭… I started researching reverse transcriptase1 inhibitors and reaching out to the Roberts and Putnam Labs to ask for advice (recorded in this Roberts Lab github issue).1 Reverse transcriptase is an enzyme that transcribes single-stranded RNA into complementary DNA (cDNA) during library prep for RNA sequencing. It was discovered in the 1970’s by David Baltimore and Howard Temin when studying retroviruses (checkout this YouTube video for a brief history on reverse transcriptase, and this YouTube video for a brief explanation of how it is used to turn mRNA to cDNA).\nSo what did I find, and what does this mean for my samples?\nThe RNA quantity, measured by Qubit Fluorometer, is good. And the RNA quality, measured by UT GSAF Bioanalyzer, is also good. The issue is that there is something else in the sample that is preventing the reverse transcriptase from generating the cDNA."

We see this happening most often when small impurities (e.g., cell debris, protein aggregation) were transferred from sample processing and got stuck on the column. They would absorb buffers and release them during elution. Ways to avoid this include increasing the amount of DNA/RNA Shield used during processing, reducing sample input, and transferring only a fraction of sample (e.g.,500 µl from 800 µl) from the BashingBead tube to avoid debris. You can also further purify your existing eluted samples with either the RNA Clean & Concentrator that is on the way to you, or by following the”Liquids/Reaction Clean-up” procedure included in the Appendices section Quick-DNA/RNA Miniprep Plus’s protocol.”"

However, the Zymo Kit is phenol-free, so the only source of phenol would be from the samples themselves. We’ll find out for sure when we send in the purified samples for another attempt at TagSeq Library Prep by UT GSAF."

    "text": "“Air temperature and tide data Air temperature and tide level data was obtained from various sources depending on the location. Hourly temperature and tide data for Toke Point and Port Townsend and tide data from Neah Bay and Budd Inlet was obtained from publically available National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) tide station data using the ‘rnoaa’ package in R (Chamberlin et al. 2021, R Core Team 2021). Hourly temperature and tide data for Vancouver and tide data for Pruth Bay was obtained from publically available Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) Canada tide station data. Air temperature data for Pruth Bay was obtained from the Hakai Institute weather station (Giesbrecht et al. 2021). Air temperature data for Neah Bay was obtained from a weather station on nearby Tatoosh Island, WA (C. Pfister and T. Wootton personal communication). Air temperature data for Budd Inlet was obtained from the nearby Evergreen State College weather station. If raw data was reported at time scale less than one hour, mean hourly temperature was calculated. These data can be accessed two ways, both of which are available (Raymond, 2022). There, static data files are archived as well as code to query and process them if necessary. Long term, 1991 – 2020, air temperature data was obtained from the National Aeronautical and Space Agency (NASA) DAYMET surface temperature database using the ‘daymetr’ package in R (Hufkens 2021). We extracted maximum and minimum daily surface air temperatures from 2° latitude by 2° longitude grids. Grids were selected by the location of the hourly temperatures/tide stations above. These are Toke Point 46.7499° N -124.0250°W, Budd Inlet 47.0643°N -122.9106°W, Neah Bay 48.3770°N -124.6897°W, Port Townsend and Vancouver 48.1172°N -122.7890°W, and Pruth Bay 51.6271°N -127.6450°W. From this raw daily data, long term daily mean high and low temperatures were calculated.

    "section": "What are phthalates?",
    "text": "What are phthalates?\nPhthalates are a suite of chemicals that share the base structure of a benzene ring and alkyl chains of varying lengths. They are commonly added to consumer products. Lower molecular weight phthalates are primarily used as solvents in cosmetics while higher molecular weight phthalates are added to plastics like polyvinyl chloride (PVC) to increase flexibility.\n\n“Plasticizers work by reducing the chemical affinity between molecules when embedded between chains of plastic raw materials (or act as monomers in polycarbonate plastic), but as plasticizers are not especially stable in these products, they can leach out and thus end up in the environment. Phthalates are not classified as persistent compounds (Staples et al.1997), but their occurrence in the environment has been reported widely, possibly arguing against a rapid biodegradation in some environments (Fatoki & Vernon 1990; Bauer & Herrmann 1997; Heemken et al. 2001; Fromme et al. 2002; Beauchesne et al.2007)” - Oehlmann et al. (2009)\n\n25 phthalate congeners are currently manufactured\n6 Phthalates identified by the U.S. EPA as priority pollutants:\nDMP (dimethyl phthalate) & DEP (diethyl phthalate)1, BBP (benzyl-butyl phthalate), DBP (dibutyl phthalate), DEHP (diethyl hexyl phthalate), DnOP (di-n-ocytl phthalate)1 water soluble solvents used more in cosmetics than in plastic products\nSince we are starting from the drawing board I’m going to do a quick review of the literature and look for environmental phthalate concentrations found in near-coastal waters, specifically I’m interested in water soluble phthalates like di-methyl phthalate (DMP) and di-ethyl phthlate (DEP). Francesco Saliu suggested we focus on water soluble phthalates in our experimental design so that we don’t have to mess with a carrier solvent control, but can still control the treatments to be within a range of environmental relevance. However, I just learned that “Low molecular weight PAEs such as dimethyl phthalate (DMP), diethyl phthalate (DEP), and DnBP are components of industrial solvents, solvents in perfumes, adhesives, waxes, inks, pharmaceutical products, insecticide materials, and cosmetics (Net et al. 2015)” and that PAEs with longer alkyl chains are used as plasticizers. Since I want to tie my work into marine plastic pollution, I should really focus on common phthalates added to plastics. Unfortunately, it looks like using a water soluble PAE may not be an option.\nIn the table from Net et al. (2015), water solubility (Sw25 ) indicates solubility in mg/L at 25\\(^\\circ\\)C. Notice that it decreases with increasing alkyl length (carbon atom per chain, or carbon chain length).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreater toxicity is associated with shorter alkyl chains\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI learned about the concept of octanol-water partition coefficient (Kow), which is a log value used for “predicting how a chemical will concentrate in marine organisms.” A high value of Kow indicates higher potential bioconcentration in organisms, explained in further detail in Net et al. (2015) and Amézqueta et al. (2020).\n\n\n\nTable 1. from Net et al. 2015\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThe half-life of PAEs decrease with temperature!!!!\nLonger half-lives are more likely under anaerobic conditions and in cold, nutrient poor environments.\nThe half-life of PAEs decrease in the presence of photosensitizers like nitrate, nitrite and chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM)22 CDOM is the fraction of dissolved organic carbon pool that absorbs light in both the ultra violet and visible ranges. It is sometimes called ‘coloured’ dissolved organic matter. The decay of organic matter releases tannins that stain the water, CDOM are the main light-absorbing particles in aquatic systems and estimated to account for 20-70% of dissolved organic carbon in the ocean, with particularly high values of CDOM in coastal zones with heavy terrestrial input (Zhao et al. 2023).\n\n\n\nEven if PAEs can be eliminated from different environmental matrices via various processes as reported in previous sections, their extensive use and permanent emissions have resulted in their ubiquitous presence in the environment. Net et al. (2015)"

(2017) that shows a review of papers that report levels of phthalates in marine waters.. however most of the sampling sites are in Europe and the Mediterranean. I’d like to expand on the table to get a better global picture of phthalate pollution levels in coastal marine waters.\nLaw, Fileman, and Matthiessen (1991) conducted sampling around the North and Irish Seas in 1988 and 1989. In this short and sweet report, values are represented as ng/dm3 which is nanograms per cubic decimeter.\n\n“The marine sediments contained about half the concentration as the freshwater lake sediments, but in both matrices DINP had the highest concentrations of all analytes. DINP has been found at higher concentrations than other phthalates in sediments of urban areas, which has been suggested to be due to its higher environmental persistence and rising use following DEHP restrictions (Björklund et al., 2009).” (Mathieu and Bednarek, 2022, p. 23) (Mathieu and Bednarek 2022)"

A measured environmental concentration that exceeds a lowest PNEC is considered by European Union member states to warrant further review for regulatory concern. These values are not considered robust thresholds; rather they are agreed-upon values by NORMAN experts to be used for preliminary prioritization of chemicals. When available, additional thresholds are used in this report, such as the sediment management standards (SMS) values for sediment cleanup objectives (SCO) and cleanup screening levels (CSLs) (Ecology, 2013; WAC 173-204).” (Mathieu and Bednarek 2022)"

We washed glassware with hexane and acetone and ashed it at 440 °C for 2 h before use (Fankhauser-Noti and Grob, 2007). For each individual bird, 3–6 g of muscle sample were homogenized and stored in a glass vial. A Quencher method with primary secondary amine (PSA), Supelclean (Sigma-Aldrich 52738-U), magnesium sulfate, and sodium chloride was used for extracting phthalates from animal tissue. Samples were weighed into 10-mL Kimax glass centrifuge tubes together with a mixture of MgSO4 and NaCl (Martins et al., 2016). One hundred nanograms of the surrogates DMP-d4 and DEHP-d4 and 2 mL of acetonitrile were added to the samples. DMP-d4 and DEHP-d4 are deuterated analogs of two of the targeted compounds in this study, and were utilized as internal standards to maintain precise quantification of phthalates (Net et al., 2015). Samples were then vortexed for 1 min and placed in an ultrasonic bath for 20 min and kept at 4 °C for 24 h to complete the extraction. Next, samples were vortexed for 5 min and centrifuged. The liquid was siphoned off and placed in a second glass culture tube that had been previously filled with MgSO4 and PSA sorbent resin to remove other organic compounds. The mixture was vortexed for 3 min and centrifuged. Next, 0.5 mL of the supernatant liquid was filtered and transferred to a 2-mL autosampler vial with Teflon septa, and internal standards DBP-d4 and DnOP-d4 were added at a concentration of 50 ng/mL.”\n\nAnalytical Method:\n\nHPLC (Agilent 1200) connected to a tandem mass spectrometer (Agilent 6410B) equipped with an ESI source.\nPhase separation was achieved with a Zorbax SB-C18 2.1 to 30 mm, 3.5 mm analytical column and XDB-C18 4.6 to 12.5, 5 mm guard column.\nMobile phases were water (A) and methanol (B) with 10 mM formic acid (B = 25–85% in 5 min, 85–90% in 9 min; B = 90% for 9 min; mass spectrometer settings: gas temperature = 300 °C; gas flow = 6 L/ min; nebulizer = 15 psi; capillary voltage = 4000 V).\nQuality control samples, method blanks, extraction blanks, solvent blanks, instrument blanks, and continuous calibration verification standards were analyzed every 10th sample and sample duplicates were analyzed with every extraction batch (approximately 20 samples).\nIn addition, spiked samples and blanks were carried through the entire extraction procedure to determine method recovery.\nPhthalate concentration was determined using external seven-level calibration using ratios of internal standards and recovery of surrogate was recorded to assure extraction recovery.\nLimit of detection (LOD) was calculated from seven-level calibrations following Harris (2010)\n\nLab: Applied Science, Engineering & Technology (ASET) laboratory, University of Alaska Anchorage\n\nWA Dept. of Ecology Analytical Lab Search\n\nACZ Laboratories, Inc., Steamboat Springs, CO\nGEL Laboratories, LLC., Charleston, SC\nKing County Environmental Laboratory, Seattle, WA\nTacoma Environmental Services Laboratory, Tacoma, WA\nManchester Environmental Laboratories"

I measured the performance of the coral symbionts’ photosynthetic efficiency (Fv/Fm), and non-photochemical quenching (via quasi dark-adapted rapid light curves) daily with the Walz Diving PAM II during the exposure. At the end of the 96 hour exposure, I flash-froze whole nubbins in liquid nitrogen to conduct RNAseq analysis of the symbiont’s gene expression.\nThe data and code files for this project are organized on GitHub at [https://github.com/sarahtanja/coral-leachate-heat]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate\n\n\nTitle\n\n\nAuthor\n\n\nCategories\n\n\nReading Time\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJul 9, 2024\n\n\nExperiment Log\n\n\nSarah Tanja\n\n\ncoral\n\n\n0 min\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"

    "text": "This spawn night checklist was used on July 5th, 6th and 7th 2024 at the Hawaiian Institute of Marine Biology (HIMB) on Moku o Loe in Kaneohe Bay, Oahu. The overarching goal was to have a comprehensive checklist for sleep-deprived scientists to follow after 3 days of pulling nearly all-nighters to collect Montipora capitata egg-sperm bundles, conduct bundle-bundle cross fertilizations in 20mL scintillation vials, and then subsequently “Fix and Freeze” the embryos at 4 hours post fertilization (hpf) when fertilized eggs should be reaching initial cleavage, 9hpf when embryos should be in the ‘prawn chip’ phase, and 14hpf when embryos should be in the early gastrula phase. The end goal is to see if low levels of PVC leachate (PVC having notably larger amounts of phthalates which are known endocrine disrupting chemicals) negatively impact fertilization success and embryonic development of Montipora capitata embryos."
