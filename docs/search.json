    "text": "1 What are phthalates?\nPhthalates are a suite of chemicals that share the base structure of a benzene ring and alkyl chains of varying lengths. They are commonly added to consumer products. Lower molecular weight phthalates are primarily used as solvents in cosmetics while higher molecular weight phthalates are added to plastics like polyvinyl chloride (PVC) to increase flexibility.\n\n“Plasticizers work by reducing the chemical affinity between molecules when embedded between chains of plastic raw materials (or act as monomers in polycarbonate plastic), but as plasticizers are not especially stable in these products, they can leach out and thus end up in the environment. Phthalates are not classified as persistent compounds (Staples et al.1997), but their occurrence in the environment has been reported widely, possibly arguing against a rapid biodegradation in some environments (Fatoki & Vernon 1990; Bauer & Herrmann 1997; Heemken et al. 2001; Fromme et al. 2002; Beauchesne et al.2007)” - Oehlmann et al. (2009)\n\nOehlmann, Jörg, Ulrike Schulte-Oehlmann, Werner Kloas, Oana Jagnytsch, Ilka Lutz, Kresten O. Kusk, Leah Wollenberger, et al. 2009. “A Critical Analysis of the Biological Impacts of Plasticizers on Wildlife.” Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences 364 (1526): 2047–62. https://doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2008.0242.\n\n25 phthalate congeners are currently manufactured\n6 Phthalates identified by the U.S. EPA as priority pollutants:\nDMP (dimethyl phthalate) & DEP (diethyl phthalate)1, BBP (benzyl-butyl phthalate), DBP (dibutyl phthalate), DEHP (diethyl hexyl phthalate), DnOP (di-n-ocytl phthalate)\n1 water soluble solvents used more in cosmetics than in plastic productsSince we are starting from the drawing board I’m going to do a quick review of the literature and look for environmental phthalate concentrations found in near-coastal waters, specifically I’m interested in water soluble phthalates like di-methyl phthalate (DMP) and di-ethyl phthlate (DEP). Francesco Saliu suggested we focus on water soluble phthalates in our experimental design so that we don’t have to mess with a carrier solvent control, but can still control the treatments to be within a range of environmental relevance. However, I just learned that “Low molecular weight PAEs such as dimethyl phthalate (DMP), diethyl phthalate (DEP), and DnBP are components of industrial solvents, solvents in perfumes, adhesives, waxes, inks, pharmaceutical products, insecticide materials, and cosmetics (Net et al. 2015)” and that PAEs with longer alkyl chains are used as plasticizers. Since I want to tie my work into marine plastic pollution, I should really focus on common phthalates added to plastics. Unfortunately, it looks like using a water soluble PAE may not be an option.\nIn the table from Net et al. (2015), water solubility (Sw25 ) indicates solubility in mg/L at 25\\(^\\circ\\)C. Notice that it decreases with increasing alkyl length (carbon atom per chain, or carbon chain length).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreater toxicity is associated with shorter alkyl chains\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI learned about the concept of octanol-water partition coefficient (Kow), which is a log value used for “predicting how a chemical will concentrate in marine organisms.” A high value of Kow indicates higher potential bioconcentration in organisms, explained in further detail in Net et al. (2015) and Amézqueta et al. (2020).\n\nAmézqueta, S., X. Subirats, E. Fuguet, M. Rosés, and C.

Elsevier. https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-816911-7.00006-2.\n\n\n\nTable 1. from Net et al. 2015\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThe half-life of PAEs decrease with temperature!!!!\nLonger half-lives are more likely under anaerobic conditions and in cold, nutrient poor environments.\nThe half-life of PAEs decrease in the presence of photosensitizers like nitrate, nitrite and chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM)2\n\n\n2 CDOM is the fraction of dissolved organic carbon pool that absorbs light in both the ultra violet and visible ranges. It is sometimes called ‘coloured’ dissolved organic matter. The decay of organic matter releases tannins that stain the water, CDOM are the main light-absorbing particles in aquatic systems and estimated to account for 20-70% of dissolved organic carbon in the ocean, with particularly high values of CDOM in coastal zones with heavy terrestrial input (Zhao et al. 2023).\nZhao, Ruoshi, Zhongqiao Li, Aung Aung Aye, Hao Zheng, Weifang Jin, Jingjing Zhang, Feng Zhou, et al. 2023. “Characteristics of Chromophoric Dissolved Organic Matter in the Northern Andaman Sea.” Frontiers in Marine Science 9. https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2022.1043194.\n\nEven if PAEs can be eliminated from different environmental matrices via various processes as reported in previous sections, their extensive use and permanent emissions have resulted in their ubiquitous presence in the environment.

A measured environmental concentration that exceeds a lowest PNEC is considered by European Union member states to warrant further review for regulatory concern. These values are not considered robust thresholds; rather they are agreed-upon values by NORMAN experts to be used for preliminary prioritization of chemicals.

We washed glassware with hexane and acetone and ashed it at 440 °C for 2 h before use (Fankhauser-Noti and Grob, 2007). For each individual bird, 3–6 g of muscle sample were homogenized and stored in a glass vial. A Quencher method with primary secondary amine (PSA), Supelclean (Sigma-Aldrich 52738-U), magnesium sulfate, and sodium chloride was used for extracting phthalates from animal tissue. Samples were weighed into 10-mL Kimax glass centrifuge tubes together with a mixture of MgSO4 and NaCl (Martins et al., 2016). One hundred nanograms of the surrogates DMP-d4 and DEHP-d4 and 2 mL of acetonitrile were added to the samples. DMP-d4 and DEHP-d4 are deuterated analogs of two of the targeted compounds in this study, and were utilized as internal standards to maintain precise quantification of phthalates (Net et al., 2015). Samples were then vortexed for 1 min and placed in an ultrasonic bath for 20 min and kept at 4 °C for 24 h to complete the extraction. Next, samples were vortexed for 5 min and centrifuged. The liquid was siphoned off and placed in a second glass culture tube that had been previously filled with MgSO4 and PSA sorbent resin to remove other organic compounds. The mixture was vortexed for 3 min and centrifuged. Next, 0.5 mL of the supernatant liquid was filtered and transferred to a 2-mL autosampler vial with Teflon septa, and internal standards DBP-d4 and DnOP-d4 were added at a concentration of 50 ng/mL.”\n\nAnalytical Method:\n\nHPLC (Agilent 1200) connected to a tandem mass spectrometer (Agilent 6410B) equipped with an ESI source.\nPhase separation was achieved with a Zorbax SB-C18 2.1 to 30 mm, 3.5 mm analytical column and XDB-C18 4.6 to 12.5, 5 mm guard column.\nMobile phases were water (A) and methanol (B) with 10 mM formic acid (B = 25–85% in 5 min, 85–90% in 9 min; B = 90% for 9 min; mass spectrometer settings: gas temperature = 300 °C; gas flow = 6 L/ min; nebulizer = 15 psi; capillary voltage = 4000 V).\nQuality control samples, method blanks, extraction blanks, solvent blanks, instrument blanks, and continuous calibration verification standards were analyzed every 10th sample and sample duplicates were analyzed with every extraction batch (approximately 20 samples).\nIn addition, spiked samples and blanks were carried through the entire extraction procedure to determine method recovery.\nPhthalate concentration was determined using external seven-level calibration using ratios of internal standards and recovery of surrogate was recorded to assure extraction recovery.\nLimit of detection (LOD) was calculated from seven-level calibrations following Harris (2010)\n\nLab: Applied Science, Engineering & Technology (ASET) laboratory, University of Alaska Anchorage\n\nWA Dept. of Ecology Analytical Lab Search\n\nACZ Laboratories, Inc., Steamboat Springs, CO\nGEL Laboratories, LLC., Charleston, SC\nKing County Environmental Laboratory, Seattle, WA\nTacoma Environmental Services Laboratory, Tacoma, WA\nManchester Environmental Laboratories"

    "text": "It’s good practice to have an active work server that you push code to GitHub, and a backup server that you’re not working in for the large files you generate. In case you somehow lock up your active work server, and need to delete it entirely for some unknown error… you have a backup of all the large files you’ve generated.\nI had to do this here , and so this is how to use rsync to regularly backup your project directory from one server to another.\nBasic rsync syntax is:\n\nrsync -avz /path/to/source user@remote_host:/path/to/destination\n\nAn example to backup a directory in raven to gannet:\n\nrsync -avz --progress /home/shared/8TB_HDD_01/stanja \\\n--exclude='*.sam' \\\n--exclude='tmp*' \\\nstanja@gannet.fish.washington.edu:/volume2/web/stanja\n\n\n-a: Archive mode, which preserves permissions, timestamps, symbolic links, etc.\n-v: Verbose, which provides detailed output of the sync process.\n-z: Compresses data during transfer, which can be helpful for speed, especially over slow networks.\n--progress: Shows progress of the file transfers.\n--exclude='*.sam': Excludes all files with a .sam extension.\n--exclude='tmp*': Excludes any files or directories that start with tmp.\n\nrsync is a powerful command-line tool for synchronizing files and directories between two locations on Unix-like systems (such as Linux and macOS). It’s particularly useful for backups, mirroring directories, and transferring files over a network efficiently. Here’s an overview of rsync and what makes it so valuable:\nKey Features of rsync\n\nIncremental File Transfer:\n\nrsync transfers only the differences between the source and the destination files. This is done by comparing file changes based on timestamps and file size by default, making it much faster than copying entire files when only small changes were made.\n\nCompression:\n\nIt can compress data during transfer (using the -z option), which is useful for large files and slower network connections.\n\nSynchronization Over Network with SSH:\n\nrsync supports transferring files over a network connection via SSH, ensuring secure, encrypted file transfers. This is especially important for syncing to remote servers.\n\nFlexible Exclusions and Inclusions:\n\nYou can use --exclude and --include options to specify patterns for files and directories you want to exclude from or include in the transfer.\n\nPreservation of Permissions and Ownership:\n\nWith the -a (archive) option, rsync can preserve file permissions, ownership, timestamps, and even symbolic links, so the file metadata remains intact between source and destination.\n\nLogging and Progress Reporting:\n\nIt provides options to log the details of each transfer, and using --progress gives real-time feedback on the status of each file being transferred.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIncomplete Transfers:\n\nIf transfers are interrupted, rsync can resume where it left off. Simply rerun the command, and it will pick up from the last successful transfer."

They may be due to the methanol solvent interactions along with the phthalates!\nThere are a few examples of ecotoxicology studies on phthalate plasticizers that use a solvent control (Park, Kim, and Kwak 2019, 2020; Zhu et al. 2022), and others that don’t mention a solvent control (Zhou et al. 2022).\n\nPark, Kiyun, Won-Seok Kim, and Ihn-Sil Kwak. 2019. “Endocrine-Disrupting Chemicals Impair the Innate Immune Prophenoloxidase System in the Intertidal Mud Crab, Macrophthalmus Japonicus.” Fish & Shellfish Immunology 87 (April): 322–32. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2019.01.025.\n\n———. 2020. “Effects of Di-(2-Ethylhexyl) Phthalate on Transcriptional Expression of Cellular Protection-Related HSP60 and HSP67B2 Genes in the Mud Crab Macrophthalmus Japonicus.” APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL 10 (8): 2766. https://doi.org/10.3390/app10082766.\n\nZhu, Fengxiao, Yuanyuan Yan, Evelyn Doyle, Changyin Zhu, Xin Jin, Zhanghao Chen, Chao Wang, Huan He, Dongmei Zhou, and Cheng Gu. 2022. “Microplastics Altered Soil Microbiome and Nitrogen Cycling: The Role of Phthalate Plasticizer.” Journal of Hazardous Materials 427 (April): 127944. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.127944.\n\nZhou, Yanfei, Yanping Li, Wenlu Lan, Hao Jiang, and Ke Pan. 2022. “Short-Term Exposure to MPs and DEHP Disrupted Gill Functions in Marine Bivalves.” Nanomaterials 12 (22, 22): 4077. https://doi.org/10.3390/nano12224077.\n\nMauduit, Florian, Amelie Segarra, Julia R.

    "text": "3.1 1. Filter & justify\nI could address the issue of the lack of methanol control in the microbiome chapter by filtering out the methylophaga bacteria that are known to ‘feed’ on methanol. This is operating under the assumption that the methylophaga bacteria present in all the samples, but especially in the ‘polluted’ samples, were only present because of the methanol solvent. This doesn’t attribute other potentially pathogenic bacteria to the presence of methanol. It’s a pretty weak method of addressing the issue.\nI could further justify the results of any differences in differentially expressed genes in the transcriptomics chapter by focusing the discussion on known pathways that are affected by phthalates, such as those involved in oxidative stress, and the transcriptions of enzymes like superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and peroxidase (POD). Similar to above, this is a pretty weak method and it’s likely those same pathways may be affected by the methanol solvent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPros\nCons\n\n\n\n\nfastest, cheapest\nnot publishable?\n\n\nno throwing away data, not wasteful\nresults are still confounded\n\n\nrealistic: I’m just a student and here’s what I learned in the time I had\nIt looks bad to have spent 3 years in a grad program with no publications\n\n\n\nThis is the easiest, quickest option.

So… be suspicious when you see at 260/280 ratio higher than 2.0!\n\n\n\nThe Zymo rep responded with the following advice:\n\n“The guanidine salts in our DNA/RNA Shield and DNA/RNA Lysis Buffer could be the reason of increased A230. We see this happening most often when small impurities (e.g., cell debris, protein aggregation) were transferred from sample processing and got stuck on the column. They would absorb buffers and release them during elution. Ways to avoid this include increasing the amount of DNA/RNA Shield used during processing, reducing sample input, and transferring only a fraction of sample (e.g.,500 µl from 800 µl) from the BashingBead tube to avoid debris. You can also further purify your existing eluted samples with either the RNA Clean & Concentrator that is on the way to you, or by following the”Liquids/Reaction Clean-up” procedure included in the Appendices section Quick-DNA/RNA Miniprep Plus’s protocol.”"

This goal of this objective is to understand the environmentally relevant range of this type of pollutant.\n\n\n\n“Simply stated, we do not currently know levels of microplastics in the ocean (water, sediments, organisms), the spatial and temporal distribution of microplastics, the sources of these materials (either in absolute or relative terms), or the direct or indirect impacts microplastics may be having on marine life. From a basic understanding of the processes degrading plastic in the environment, it is likely that marine microplastics will persist in the ocean for very long times, and that levels of microplastics are likely accumulating world-wide (Thompson et al., 2004).” - Center for Urban Waters, Sources and Distribution of Marine Microplastics\n\n\n1 Who monitors marine microplastics in Puget Sound and the Salish Sea, and what are they finding?\n\n1.0.1 Seattle Aquarium\nSeattle Aquarium, Seattle, Washington engages in long-term monitoring of plastics and marine debris collected from their seawater intake pump and off the side of the pier where they are located. They published some of their data taken from 2019-2020 in Harris et al. (2022), where they indicate they found between 0.0 and 0.64 microparticles sized between 330 μm to 5000 μm per liter of seawater sampled.\n\nOnly microparticles 330 to 5000 μm (length; Masura et al., 2015) were categorized and measured due to the resolution of the microscope and camera. - Harris et al.

The overarching goal was to have a comprehensive checklist for sleep-deprived scientists to follow after 3 days of pulling nearly all-nighters to collect Montipora capitata egg-sperm bundles, conduct bundle-bundle cross fertilizations in 20mL scintillation vials, and then subsequently “Fix and Freeze” the embryos at 4 hours post fertilization (4hpf) when fertilized eggs should be reaching initial cleavage, 9hpf when embryos should be in the ‘prawn chip’ phase, and 14hpf when embryos should be in the early gastrula phase. The end goal is to see if low levels of PVC leachate (PVC having notably larger amounts of phthalates which are known endocrine disrupting chemicals) negatively impact fertilization success and embryonic development of Montipora capitata embryos."

    "text": "2.3 Dilute ZFIX\nTo preserve embryos for confocal microscope imaging, and visual determination of developmental stage, we have to preserve the embryo tissue and keep it from disintegrating, bursting, shredding… etc. To do that we can use ZFIX (zinc buffered formalin). There is a wide range (4-20%!) reported in the literature of ZFIX or paraformaldehye concentrations used for tissue preservation. We chose to work with 4% ZFIX. Some constraints we took into account are that FedEx will let you ship any volume of formalin as long as it’s below 10% concentration, and the less concentrated… the ‘safest’ it is for us to handle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nAlways handle ZFIX, formalin, paraformaldehyde, etc. in a fume hood, or a place with adequate ventilation (outside, with a stiff breeze, no huffing).\n\n\nHere we are going from ZFIX concentrate of 18.5% to a diluted 4% in a ~100mL final volume!\n0.185 * V1 = 0.04 * 100mL\nV1 = 21.62mL\nTo get 100mL of 4% ZFIX we: Added 21.62 mL of 18.5% ZFIX to 78.38mL of (0.22micron) filtered sea water\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nJill Ashey (personal communication) says it’s important to use FSW to dilute your ZFIX! This is for long-term storage (up to 6 months) of embryos in anywhere from 4-20% ZFIX or paraformaldehyde (PFA) … the FSW may keep your embryos from lysing so that you can preserve their integrity for microscopy. If using DI or Milli-Q water, there is a chance that the embryos become ‘shriveled’. This being said… we used Milli-Q water for crosses 1-5 (before learning that FSW is best), and checked them after 48 hours. They looked perfectly preserved! We kept them in ~500uL of 4% ZFIX in micro-centrifuge tubes at 4C."

In this case, each scintillation vial either had only 22 micron filtered seawater (control - 0 mg/L PVC leachate), a low environmental dose (low - 0.01 mg/L PVC leachate), a mid dose (mid - 0.1 mg/L PVC leachate), or a high dose (1mg/L PVC leachate). Each ‘n’ set of treatments, embryonic phases, and sample types (microscopy and molecular) should try to have the same genetic cross (aka same set of parent colonies).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nTwice (once attempting this in 2022, and once in 2024) I noticed poor viability and cross-fertilization success when attempting to cross Montipora capitata colonies that are growing on the Padilla-Gamino Lab “racks”… these colonies have been growing in proximity to each other since 2017. Crosses between “rack” colonies and “wild” colonies, as well as “wild-wild” crosses seem fine… but here, we avoided “rack-rack” colony crosses, as they proved to result in poor fertilization success.\n\n\nAs soon as bundles begin to hydrate and ‘break-up’, the ability to do bundle-bundle crosses ends. This gives you a very short (1 hour!) window, as spawning typically starts around ~8:45 - 9:15 PM, and bundles begin hydrating and breaking up ~10:00 - 10:40 PM. we found that a single person can feasibly cross 120 scintillation vials in this timeframe. In our experimental design, that translates to an ‘n’ of 5, or 5 ‘crosses’ each night of spawning."

We will then carefully pipette off (decant) as much excess FSW out of the tube as possible, and then add ~1mL of 4% ZFIX to each microcentrifuge tube in the fume hood. Then gently invert each capped scintillation vial to mix the ZFIX into the filtered seawater and sample. Arrange in a wax freezer box and set fixed vials in 4C fridge."

We will first very gently use a new transfer pipette to transfer embryos from the 20mL scintillation vials to our 0.5mL screw-cap cryo-tubes. We will then carefully pipette off (decant) as much excess FSW out of the tube as possible, and then add 500uL of Zymo RNA/DNA Shield. Gently invert cryo-tubes a few times to ensure embryos are fully submerged. Once cryo-tubes are filled with their samples, arrange them in wax paper boxes and promptly shift them to -80°C freezer for storage until samples are ready to be processed. The combined DNA/RNA Shield and the quick freeze (due to small size) they will experience in the -80 are together sufficient for preserving RNA."

I skipped the Proteinase K digestion as per the ‘cells’ sample prep instruction in the kit manual. I think I can add this back in if I’m finding protein impurities in the eluted RNA.\n\n\n\n\n3 Extraction Notes\ndate: 13-AUG-2024\nkit: Zymo Quick-DNA/RNA Miniprep Plus Kit\n\nThaw samples to room temp\nVortex to mix\nCentrifuge at 500xg for 1 minute to get rid of any bubbles\nRemove 400uL of DNA/RNA Shield supernatent\nAdd 400uL of DNA/RNA Lysis Buffer\nVortex to mix for 5 seconds\nCheck to see that embryos have dissolved\n\nEmbryos weren’t totally lysed, and there was at least visible cell debris in each tube… I called Zymo and they suggested I try:\n\nAdding more DNA/RNA Lysis Buffer & Mixing until supernatent is clear\nUsing BeadBashing Tubes to ensure Lysis\nTrying PK Digestion without BeadBashing\n\n\n\nI ended up trying 3 different things:\nWith 123C9 I transferred the 500uL of sample in DNA/RNA Shield and DNA/RNA Lysis Buffer to the Qiagin Tissue Disrupter Tube & set it in the mortexer for 2 minutes. This created a clear supernatent, and didn’t involve adding any DNA/RNA Lysis Buffer volume. The Qiagin Tissue Disrupteer is also a solid single bead, so I didn’t need to worry about sucking up any tiny glass beads into the pipette when I did transfer the supernatent to the spin column.\nWith 123L9 I transferred the 500uL of sample in Shield and Lysis Buffer to the Zymo 0.1-0.5mm BeadBashing Lysis Tubes, & set in mortexer for 2 minutes, then centrifuged at 16,000xg for 1 minute. I then added 600uL more of DNA/RNA Lysis Buffer and centrifuged again at 16,000xg for 1 minute. I transferred 600uL of the cleared supernatent from each tube sequentially through the filter (being careful to leave ~500uL of volume in the tube so as not to disrupt/suck up the tiny glass beads\nFor 123M9, I tried just increasing the DNA/RNA Lysis Buffer by 600uL and vortexing to see if that would clear up any debris. It didn’t.. SO I split 1 bead bashing tube into each of the three microcentrifuge tubes and set it in the mortexer for 1 minute.\n—&gt; Proceed to purification\n\nAt this point, we have three cryovials for each spin column… each with varying volumes of sample. Sequentially transfer sample into yellow Spin-Away Filter in a Collection Tube and centrifuge for 30s at 16,000xg SAVE THE FLOW THROUGH FOR RNA PURIFICATION\nDoubled volume of 100% (200 proof) ethanol to the RNA flow through in a falcon tube and vortexed to mix\nSequentially transfer RNA flow-through + ethanol in volumes =&gt;700uL into the green Zymo Spin IIICG Column in a Collection Tube\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nThis was most difficult with the 123L9 and 123M9 samples because they had larger volumes to work with, meaning you have to pass it through the spin filter more, and there’s more flow-through you have to save. The volume of the saved flow-through exceeded that of the collection tube, so I had to start saving the flow through in a 15mL falcon tube. After doubling with 200-proof ethanol, I ended up with ~3mL for 123C9, ~4mL for 123L9, and ~5mL for 123M9 that all had to get passed through the RNA green spin column. This took awhile and was a bottle neck in the process… I’m also not thrilled about using the falcon tubes (they’re not DNase-RNase free…), So I want to find a way to do this where I can use the collection tubes provided.\n\n\nPerformed DNase I Treatment on green RNA spin column\n\nI didn’t invert to mix… I always lose some volume ‘beads’ in the lid when I do this.

For this, I partnered with Dr. Francesco Saliu and his lab of environmental chemists at the Universita degli studi di Milano-Bicocca in Milan, Italy. Dr. Saliu has been actively using mass spectrometry and solid-phase micro-extraction to identify and characterize the chemical toxins and bioactive compounds associated with microplastic pollution.\nDr. Saliu sent me 8 microplastic types that his lab used to create leachate that was later analyzed with mass spectrometry:\nEach microplastic leachate type has a unique thumbprint or ‘signature’ of chemical makeup created via the leaching process and UV photodegradation. The microplastic type I am most keen to study is PVC.\nSo how do we use these microplastics to re-create the leachate solutions described above?\nFirst we need to gather materials & equipment:"

Make artificial seawater\n\nPrepare artificial seawater according to ASTM D1141-98 technical bulletin (buy salt for artificial seawater here)\nThe ASTM D1141-98 Sea-Salt mix and resulting Substitute Ocean Water solution should have the following component breakdown:\n\n\n\nIn a 1-liter erlenmeyer flask, add 41.953 grams of ASTM D1141-98 Sea-Salt. Then add deionized water1 to the flask until you achieve a final 1-liter volume.\nStir to dissolve the salt using any implement that isn’t plastic or plastic/teflon coated (metal or glass stir-rods, or glass-coated magnetic stir-bars, etc.)\nAfter mixing, adjust the pH to 8.22\nMeasure initial pH using a calibrated pH meter\n\n1 Depending on the nature of the testing and the degree of accuracy needed we suggest mixing with Deionized (DI) or Distilled water. For a more highly accurate result we recommend using the ASTM Type II reagent grade deionized/distilled water.2 Some useful background info on adjusting pH from phadjustment.com (in a wastewater treatment context)\\[\nAcid + Base \\longrightarrow Salt + Water\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nPure water (H2O) is amphoteric, meaning it can act as both an acid and as a base\n\n\n\nIf the pH is less than &lt;8.2, make it more alkaline using 0.1M sodium hydroxide3 (NaOH, 39.997g/mol) Slowly add via burette\nIf the pH is more than &gt;8.2, make it more acidic using 0.1M hydrochloric acid[^4] (HCl, 36.47 g/mol)\nOptional: filter out any remaining solids4\n\n3 “The sea salt does include a small number of insoluble solids occurring naturally in some of the main components.

    "text": "3 Serial Dilution\n\nTo prepare the leachate we put 250mg of material in 250 ml. At the end of the treatment you  will have 250ml corresponding to 1g/L of plastic ( PAEs approximately at 10% so 100 mg/L, other contaminants at  10-0.1 mg/L,  we will give you the exact concentration for each contaminant)\nBy successive dilution you can therefore have 2L  in volume at 100 mg/L  and as much as you want in term of volume (more than 4L) at 10, 1, 0.1, 0.01 mg/L. with controls ( no plastic added)\nSo just in the case if you want to run test at 100 mg/L you have to reschedule the number of test with the limited amount of material, but in my opinion this is an extremely high and unrealistic concentration that does not replicate the real environmental exposure scenario. I think that 10 mg/L is reasonable as the highest concentration to be tested.\nHowever in the literature you can find experiments with level of plastic particles at even 1g/L. Of course, at this concentration they report coral bleaching and mortality but in my opinion it is like to say that plastic is toxic to humans because cause asphyxia  when you put your head in a plastic bag.\n\n\nThe 100% leachate solution correlates to 1 gram of plastic per liter and 100mg/L ( 100,000 ug/L ) concentration of PAEs. This as noted by Dr. Saliu above, this concentration is extremely high and does not represent a realistic environmental level of pollution, but practically, is what was best for leachate chemical characterization.\nEnvironmental concentrations of PAEs in seawater globally have been reported to be between below limit of detection ( 0 ug/L ) and 168 ug/L.\nEnvironmental concentrations of plastics in Puget Sound have been reported in numbers of particles per volume for seawater and numbers of particles per mass or area for sediment. There is no consensus on environmental microplastic concentrations in Puget Sound, data is sparse, and variable. In this realm, we are taking educated guesses at best.\n\nSo we are going to target the following microplastic concentrations:\n10 mg/L (overdose)\n1 mg/L (environmental dose, high dose)\n0.1 mg/L (environmental dose, mid dose)\n0.01 mg/L (environmental dose, low dose)\n0 mg/L (control)\nTo do this we will do a serial dilution.\n\nFirst make 400mL of each stock solution from the 1000 mg/L prepared leachate\n\n\nMake 10 mg/L stock:\n1000 mg/L * V1 = 10 mg/L * 400mL\nV1 = 4mL\n400mL of 10mg/L stock = 4mL of 1000mg/L stock + 396mL of FSW\nMake 1mg/L stock:\n10mg/L * V1 = 1mg/L * 400mL\nV1 = 40mL\n400mL of 1mg/L stock = 40mL of 10mg/L stock + 360mL of FSW\nMake 0.1 mg/L stock:\n1mg/L * V1 = 0.1mg/L * 400mL\nV1 = 40mL\n400mL of 0.1mg/L stock = 40mL of 1mg/L stock + 360mL of FSW\n\n\nThen dilute the stock to each treatment vial/jar\n\n\n3.1 20mL Scintillation vials\nFor a 20mL scintillation vial for coral embryo experiments with a final target volume of 18mL:\n1mg/L HIGH treatment\n10mg/L * V1 = 1mg/L * 18mL\nV1 = 1.8mL\n18mL of 1mg/L leachate = 16.2mL of FSW + 1.8mL of 10mg/L stock\n0.1 mg/L MID treatment\n1mg/L * V1 = 0.1mg/L * 18mL\nV1 = 1.8mL\n18mL of 0.1mg/L leachate = 16.2mL of FSW + 1.8mL of 1mg/L stock\n0.01 mg/L LOW treatment\n0.1mg/L * V1 = 0.01mg/L * 18mL\nV1 = 1.8mL\n18mL of 0.01mg/L leachate = 16.2mL of FSW + 1.8mL of 0.1mg/L stock"

These anemones were collected for use in the preliminary respiration and photosynthesis response curves, and we were not concerned with genotype since we wouldn’t be subjecting them to RNA extraction and differential gene expression analysis.\nWe made the collections at 15:00, at a -0.4ft low tide. Thankfully, Anthopleura elegantissima are found higher in the intertidal zone.

Symbiotic dinoflagellates, unlike free-living marine algae, exist in coral tissue equipped with additional photoprotective and thermoprotective mechanisms, for example, fluorescent proteins (Dove 2004) and heat shock proteins (Black, Voellmy & Szmant 1995), which may complement or even surpass photoprotective mechanisms linked to the algal pigment profile and thus help maintain the integrity of the symbiosis (Brown et al. 2002a).” (Venn et al., 2006, p. 2140\n\nWhy is chlorophyll content an important metric if we’ve already used the pulse-amplitude modulated (PAM) fluorometer to measure photosynthetic efficiency, quantum yield, etc.?"

    "text": "A boulder covered in A. elegantissima anemones at Owens Beach near Point Defiance, Tacoma, Washington\n\n\nAnthopleura elegantissima are clonal intertidal anemones that can form flexible symbiotic partnerships with different single-celled algae which provide supplemental sugars to their diet, or alternatively, they can live ‘aposymbiotically’, relying wholly on prey capture for their food. They are commonly called the ‘aggregating anemone’, or ‘clonal-anemone’ because they form large clonal aggregates. Another common-name is the ‘pink-tipped anemone’, because of the pink tinge to the tips of their tentacles. As shown in the image above, they can completely cover large boulders in the intertidal zone with hundreds of individuals that are all genetic clones of each other.\n\n“This anemone is an effective predator living in zooplankton-rich water, so one would not expect it to be as nutrient-limited, nor as dependent on algal photosynthetic productivity as its tropical symbiotic counterparts. It is also adapted to prolonged aerial exposure and greater temperature extremes; the animal feeds and its symbionts photosynthesize at temperatures approaching 5°C.” - McCloskey, Cove, and Verde (1996)\n\n\n\nThe aggregating anemone was first described in scientific literature by Johann-Friedrich Brandt in 1835. Their taxonomic name, Anthopleura elegantissima (Brandt 1835), is thus tied to a latin description which can be translated:\n\n“The body is large, pustular, red, green, blue, or brown, or even spotted with green and purple. The disc is oval, with a white striated margin and a sub-pentangular margin of half a foot in diameter. The tentacles at the base and apex are narrowed and widened white, the apex is purple, marked with a purple band in the middle. On the shores of the island of Sitka.”\n\n\n\n\nThis original description of what is now called Anthopleura elegantissima, but was originally ‘Actinia elegantissima’ was made by Johann-Friedrich Brandt in 1835. This description was published in latin, in a book titled ‘Prodromus descriptionis animalium ab H. Mertensio observatorum : fascic. I. Polypos, Acalephas Discophoras et Siphonophoras, nec non Echinodermata continens’ in St. Petersburg, Russia\n\n\nBrandt was a German-Russian naturalist who was director of the Zoological Museum of St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences and described speciments from the expeditions of explorers off the Pacific Coast of North America. He may be best known for the description of birds like ‘Brandt’s cormorant’ and the spectacled eider. This original description by Brandt in 1835 suggests that the collection and description of this anemone species in Sitka1 was done in conjuction with colonial expansion and oppression.\n1 In 1799 Captain Alexander Baranov, General Manager of the Shelikov-Golikov Company, establishes Sitka as a trading post as the first Russian trading charter grants the Russian-American Company sole trading rights in America for 20 years.

Even where they co-occur with spatially dominant mussels, densities of A. elegantissima can reach 500 individuals m\u00012 (Sebens 1982b). Hosting symbiotic green chlorophytes (Elliptochloris marina LETSCH) and brown dinophytes (Symbiodinium spp.), members of A. elegantissima contribute significantly to intertidal productivity; in Southern California, their photosynthetic contribution is on par with that of intertidal seaweeds (Fitt et al. 1982).” ((Bingham et al. 2011), p. 291)"

Dayton (1971) monitored internal body temperatures of A. elegantissima in the field and found that anemones could survive body temperatures as high as 33.6°C with no apparent negative effect. Over 3 d of field study, with different levels of sunlight and wind, body temperatures of A. elegantissima in our treatments often exceeded 24°C, and reached 32°C in the most extreme cases. Although not lethal, temperatures in this range induce the production of heat shock proteins in A. elegantissima (Snyder & Rossi 2004), which may involve significant metabolic costs (Somero 2002).” ((Bingham et al. 2011), p. 296)\n\nBingham et al. (2011) found that aggregated anemones remain cooler than isolated individuals. They posit that the anemones in an aggregate benefit from more thermal stability due to the ‘extracorporeal’ trapped water between indivudal polyps and reduced ‘windage’.\n\n“Seasonal surveys at our field site revealed larger aggregations of A. elegantissima in the high intertidal zone than at lower tidal elevations, but only in the summer when temperatures were highest (Fig. 5), suggesting that aggregation in high intertidal zones may be a behavioral response to desiccation and temperature stress.” ((Bingham et al. 2011), p. 298)\n\n\n“In our field experiments, even in foggy emersion conditions, Anthopleura elegantissima body temperatures reached 8oC above ambient seawater. A. elegantissima body temperatures on sunny days reach values 17°C above that of ambient seawater, similar to that reported for emersed mussels (Mytilus sp.) and limpets (Patella vulgata) in temperate intertidal zones (Davies, 1970; Elvin and Gonor, 1979; Hofmann and Somero, 1995, 1996; Roberts et al., 1997; Helmuth, 1998).” (Snyder and Rossi 2004)\n\nSnyder, Mark, and Sergio Rossi. 2004. “Stress Protein (HSP70 Family) Expression in Intertidal Benthic Organisms: The Example of Anthopleura Elegantissima (Cnidaria: Anthozoa).” Scientia Marina 68 (April)."

Individuals on the edges of clonal aggregations of A. elegantissima function as warriors, developing large acrorhagi (specialized organs filled with nematocysts) to defend the boundaries of the clone (Francis 1976).

Photoinhibitory phenomena are often associated with damage to the photosynthetic apparatus. If so, the ZX would likely devote more energy and resources to damage control and repair; subsequently less energy and photosynthetic products would be available to support continued algal growth. Since ZX also displayed photoinhibition at 1,400 lmolÆm–2Æs–1, yet did not show a reduction in MI, the onset of the deleterious effects of damage repair would seem to occur at intensities above 1,400 lmolÆm–2Æ s–1. In contrast, anemone metabolic rates were elevated at 2,000 lmolÆm–2Æs–1; it may simply be that the host requires more energy and organic resources to meet its elevated respiratory demands, and the ZX symbiont provides both at the expense of its own growth E. and L.

    "text": "4.6 Symbiosis\nA. elegantissima gains symbionts through horizontal transmission (Lajeunesse and Trench 2000). (Trench 1987)\nNormally, A. elegantissima expels symbionts from its coelenteron in a bolus of mucus and undigested material. Expulsion of symbionts should not be confused with “bleaching” phenomenon in reef corals, and may serve an ulterior purpose and undergo a different process. The anemones ‘cull’ or ‘weed’ the symbionts to maintain an optimal symbiont population density.\nThe optimized symbiont density is reported in the literature as 106 cells·mg-1 of host protein and 1-5·106 cells·cm-2 (McCloskey, Cove, and Verde 1996).\n\nSea anemones of the genus Anthopleura along northeast Pacific intertidal shores engage in a particularly unique symbiosis with two especially phylogenetically and physiologically different symbionts: the chlorophyte Elliptochloris marina (Letsch et al., 2009) and the dinoflagellate Symbiodinium muscatinei (LaJeunesse and Trench, 2000). - James L. Dimond et al. (2017)\n\nThe Symbiodinium muscatinei(Lajeunesse and Trench 2000)were reclassified as Breviolum muscatinei\n\nLajeunesse, Tc, and Rk Trench. 2000. “Biogeography of Two Species of Symbiodinium (Freudenthal) Inhabiting the Intertidal Sea Anemone Anthopleura Elegantissima (Brandt).” The Biological Bulletin 199 (2): 126–34. https://doi.org/10.2307/1542872.\n\nMcCloskey, L.

It is rare for mixed assemblages of the two ‘symbiont morphs’ to occur. In the paper by McCloskey, Cove, and Verde (1996), they found that among 91 anemones, &gt;95% had a single symbiont type. The chlorophyte Elliptochloris marina is relatively sensitive to light and is limited to cooler, low light environments typical of the low intertidal. The dinoflagellate B. muscatinei, on the other hand, tolerates higher light and temperatures and is more commonly found in anemones in the upper intertidal zone. Aposymbiotic (non-symbiont forming) A. elegantissima anemones can be found thriving in very low light conditions, often inside rocky crevasses within the intertidal zone. Transplantation of A. elegantissima anemones with chlorophyte E. marina symbionts to warmer, higher-light environments results in shifts in the symbiont population from E. marina to B. muscatinei (James L. Dimond et al. 2017).\nAnemones hosting B. muscatinei have a golden-brown color, while those that host E. marina are mossy green. Symbiont type can be verified by viewing excised tentacles under light microscopy, and commonly, no mixed-symbiont populations are observed (James L. Dimond et al. 2017).\n\nDimond, James L., Shad Orechovesky, Jonas Oppenheimer, Jean Rodríguez-Ramos, and Brian L.

If the data do not meet the assumptions of normality required for parametric tests like the paired t-test, but you want to determine if there is a trend between two paired samples, you can use the Wilcoxon paired-sample T test. This is a non-parametric statistical test used to compare two related samples or repeated measures. It is appropriate for this dataset, because each row of DNA and RNA were extracted from the same sample. Here we really want to know if our Dual extraction method is biased toward optimizing yield for DNA or RNA, or if there is any trend at all. &gt; Our null and alternate hypotheses are:\nH0: There is no trend between the paired samples.\nH1: There is a trend between the paired samples.\n\nwilcox.test(x=qubit_scores$qubit_dna_avg, y=qubit_scores$qubit_rna_avg, paired=TRUE, alternative = 'two.sided')\n\n\n    Wilcoxon signed rank exact test\n\ndata:  qubit_scores$qubit_dna_avg and qubit_scores$qubit_rna_avg\nV = 86, p-value = 0.498\nalternative hypothesis: true location shift is not equal to 0\n\n\nThe Wilcoxon signed-rank test, as a non-parametric test, determines whether there is a shift or trend in the paired observations but does not provide information about the direction or magnitude of the shift. It only tells you that there is a significant difference between the paired samples, but it does not indicate which sample has higher values or the direction of the shift.\nTo determine the direction of the shift, you would need to examine the data and calculate the median or mean of the paired differences. If the median or mean of the differences is positive, it suggests that the second sample tends to have higher values than the first sample. Conversely, if the median or mean is negative, it indicates that the first sample tends to have higher values than the second sample.\nTo get a better understanding of the direction and magnitude of the shift, you may consider plotting the paired differences or constructing a confidence interval around the median or mean difference. This can provide additional insights into the nature of the shift and help you interpret the results more accurately."

This allows you to scoop the powder and have it remain cold❄️ while you transfer it as a cold dry powder through the funnel into the bead-bashing tube. If the scoopula and funnel are room temperature, when they touch the cold powdered sample they condensate and the sample gets wet and booger-like in consistency, making it impossible to transfer into the bead-bashing tube.Purification Station\n\ncentrifuge\nmicrocentrifuge tube racks\npipettes\npipette tips\n\nI tend to arrange my workflow left to right:\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n  subgraph Lysing\n  A[LN2 dewer&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;dry-ice bucket] --&gt; B((mortar & pestle))\n  B --&gt; C[[lysing&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;tube&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;rack]]\n  end\n  subgraph Purification\n  C --&gt; D[[DNA&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;tube&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;rack]]\n  D --&gt; E[[RNA&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;tube&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;rack]]\n  end\n  \n     classDef green fill:#9f6,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px;\n     classDef yellow fill:#ff0,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px;\n     classDef purple fill:#993399,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px;\n     classDef white fill:#ffffff,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px;\n     classDef grey fill:#999999,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px;\n     class E green\n     class D yellow\n     class C purple\n     class B white\n     class A grey\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMake sure you have trash, pipette disposal, and liquid kit waste disposal containers within easy reach of the bench.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3 Label Tubes\n\npick out three microcentrifuge tube racks:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n\nC[[lysing&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;tube&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;rack]]\nC --&gt; D[[DNA&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;tube&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;rack]]\nD --&gt; E[[RNA&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;tube&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;rack]]\n\n     classDef green fill:#9f6,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px;\n     classDef yellow fill:#ff0,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px;\n     classDef purple fill:#993399,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px;\n     class E green\n     class D yellow\n     class C purple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor each sample, arrange the following tubes in microcentrifuge tube racks:\n\nbead-bashing tube\nnuclease-free tube for proteinase K digestion\nnuclease-free tube for addition of Lysis Buffer\nDNA Spin-Away Filter (yellow) in a Collection Tube (Quick-DNA/RNA Miniprep Plus)\nCollection Tube (Quick-DNA/RNA Miniprep Plus)\nnuclease-free tube for eluted DNA\nQubit assay tube for 1uL of eluted DNA\nRNA Spin-Away Filter (green) in a Collection Tube (Quick-DNA/RNA Miniprep Plus)\nnuclease-free tube for eluted RNA\nZymo Spin IC Column in a Collection Tube (RNA Clean & Concentrator-5)\nnuclease-free tube for eluted purified RNA\nQubit assay tube for 1uL of eluted RNA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTubes should be laid out and labelled like this photo shown here ☝️\n\n\n\nOnly thin-wall, clear 0.5 mL PCR tubes are appropriate for use in the Qubit® fluorometer.

    "section": "3 Extraction Steps",
    "text": "3 Extraction Steps\n\n3.1 Grind/Homogenize: Mortar & Pestle Samples\n\nTake dry-ice cooler to the -80 freezer, pull out frozen samples and place them in the dry-ice cooler. Work quickly and carefully to sort through the vials and select the ones that you are working with. Nest the selected sample vials in the dry ice, and return the rest back to the -80 freezer. Bring working samples on dry-ice back to the lab bench.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlace the ❄️scoopulas❄️ and ❄️mini funnels❄️ in the dry ice 🧊 bucket!\n\n\n\nDon cryo-gloves over nitrile gloves and ⚠️carefully⚠️ dispense a small amount of liquid nitrogen (LN2) into the transfer thermos. Everyone working with LN2 should have taken the Liquid Nitrogen Online Safety Course found HERE\nGrind each sample with mortar & pestle on LN2 -\n\n⚠️carefully⚠️ pour a small amount of LN2 into a sterilized mortar\nUsing sterilized forceps, pluck out coral fragments from the cryo vial and place in the mortar until you have about as much material as a lima bean. Material amount does not have to be precise.\nPestle the coral fragment until it is ground to a powder5. Work quickly to ensure the sample remains frozen. Add more LN2 when it evaporates from the mortar. This step is challenging! LN2 evaporates very quickly and must be replenished multiple times.\n\n\n5 The coral fragments are prone to ‘squirting out’ from under the pestle. Don’t lose sample material! Rather than use your arms to ‘stir’ the fragments in a circular motion, crush the fragments by firmly placing the pestle square atop a fragment and press your whole torso body-weight onto the pestle. Think like a hydraulic press!\n\n3.2 Lyse: Bead-Bash Samples\n\nAdd 500uL of DNA/RNA Shield to each 2mL (0.1 - 0.5mm) bead-bashing tube\n\n\n\nIn initial extractions I only used 500uL of DNA/RNA Sheild and was advised to increase it to at least 800uL by a Zymo rep:\n\n“A minimum of 800 µl of liquid volume is what we typically recommend when working with the BashingBead Tubes. This is because anything lower may lead to inefficient bead movement during shaking, oversaturation of content, and difficulties when transferring sample from the tube without disturbing the debris. All of these can lead to impurity by precipitation/clogging in the columns, therefore we highly recommend increasing the amount of DNA/RNA Shield for processing.”\n\n\nUse chilled, sterilized scoopula and a sterilized chilled mini-funnel to transfer the sample powder to its correspondingly labelled bead bashing tube\nAim to transfer 500uL of powdered volume (take up about 1/4th of the 2mL tube, or an equal volume as the beads)\nCap the bead-bashing tube and shake it like a Polaroid picture\nOpen the tube, and ‘top-off’ the sample with another 1000uL of DNA/RNA Shield, bringing the total volume to 1500uL\nVortex to ensure powder is fully submersed in DNA/RNA Shield\nSet bead-bashing tubes in Mortexer and homogenize at high speed for 40 minutes\n\n\n\n3.3 Proteinase-K Digestion\n\nGet the Proteinase K out of the -20 freezer & set the heat-block to warm up to 55C for 30mins\nAfter bead bashing, tubes are ‘intensely bubbly’, to tamp down bubbles, centrifuge in the mini-centrifuge for 1min\nTransfer 600uL of supernatent to a new nuclease-free tube, making sure not to disturb beads and debris at the bottom of the bead-bashing tube6\nAdd Proteinase K & Buffer\n\nAdd the appropriate volume of Pro K buffer and Proteinase K (Proteinase K is stored in the -20 after being reconstituted)\n(10:1 ratio of sample:digestion buffer) & (2:1 ratio of digestion buffer:Proteinase K)\nFor tubes with approximately 500uL of sample add:\n\n50ul pro K buffer\n25ul proteinase K\n\n\nVortex to mix\nIncubate in the heat-block for 30mins at 55C\nVortex to mix & centrifuge on max for 2mins to pellet any debris\nTransfer 350uL of the cleared supernatent to a new 1.5mL nuclease-free tube, making sure not to disturb any debris at the bottom of the tube\nAdd 350uL of DNA/RNA Lysis Buffer to the supernatent(1:1) and vortex to mix\n\n6 Why do we transfer from the bead-bashing tube to two different nuclease-free tubes in this step? Jerry Yu from Zymo says:\n\n“We are worried about the sample debris remaining in the tube, which should still contain protein. One of the reasons for Proteinase K treatment at this step is to break down protein in the solution to make it less viscous/sticky, so the column can process it without issue. By transferring the mixture out, the treatment could be more efficient.”"

    "text": "4 Purify DNA & RNA\nTransfer the buffered supernatent (should be a total of 700uL, which can be passed through the filter in one go) to yellow Spin-Away Filter in a Collection Tube and centrifuge at 16,000xg for 30 sec\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSave The flow-through in the collection tube for RNA purification! At this step the DNA is in the yellow spin column filter and the RNA is in the flow through.\n\n\n\nTransfer the yellow Spin-Away Filter to a new Collection Tube\n\nTo the RNA flow-through, add 700uL (1:1) of 200-proof ethanol to the flow-through and mix by pipetting up and down 12 times\nThe RNA+ethanol volume is now 1,400uL. In aliquots up to 700uL, transfer the RNA sample to the green Zymo-Spin IIICG Column in a Collection Tube, centrifuge, and discard the flow-through. Dab the rim of the collection tube with a Kim Wipe to clean off any residual flow-through. This step binds the RNA to the green column filter. Repeat until all RNA Sample has passed through the filter.\n\n\n4.0.1 DNase 1 Treatment for RNA\n\nAdd 400uL DNA/RNA Wash Buffer to the green Zymo-Spin IIICG Column, centrifuge and discard the flow-through\nFor each sample to be treated, prepare DNase 1 Reaction Mix: \\[\nDNase\\, 1\\, volume = 5 \\mu L * (no.\\, of\\, sample\\, preps)\n\\] \\[\nDNA\\, Digestion\\, Buffer\\, volume  = 75 \\mu L * (no.\\, of\\, sample\\, preps)\n\\]\nAdd 75uL of DNA Digestion Buffer per prep to a new nuclease-free tube\nAdd 5uL of reconstituted DNase 1 (thawed if previously frozen at -20C) per sample prep to the nuclease-free tube\nMix by gentle inversion\nCarefully drip 80uL of DNase 1 Reaction Mix directly onto the green Zymo-Spin IIICG Column filter and let incubate at room temperature for 15mins\n\n\n\n4.1 Wash & Elute\n\nAdd 400uL DNA/RNA Prep Buffer to each column and centrifuge at 16,000xg for 30s, then discard the flow-through\nAdd 700uL of DNA/RNA Wash Buffer 7to each column and centrifuge at 16,000xg for 30s, then discard the flow-through\nAdd 400uL of DNA/RNA Wash Buffer to each column and centrifuge at 16,000xg for 2mins to ensure complete removal of the wash buffer, then discard the flow-through\nConduct a dry spin and centrifuge at 16,000xg for 2mins to ensure complete removal of the wash buffer prior to elution8\nCarefully transfer the column into the nuclease-free tube labelled for containing the eluted DNA/RNA end products\nAdd 70uL DNase/RNase-Free Water directly to the column matrix and centrifuge at 16,000xg for 30s\nPlace eluted DNA/RNA tubes on ice to continue work, or store in the -80C freezer for later\n\n7 Slowly dispense wash buffer along the sides of the filter like pouring a heady beer down the side of a pint glass. Jerry Yu from Zymo says:\n\n“You are correct with the beer analogy. By slowly dispensing wash buffer along the inner radius of the column, you can rinse off salts/residuals from previous spins, so future spins will be cleaner.”\n\n8 Another tip from Zymo:\n\nThe goal of rinsing and reducing the volume of wash buffer is to avoid residual buffer from previous washes to end up in the elution, which will reduce purity. If volume of the wash buffer is increased in the final wash step, make sure to also increase the centrifugation time (e.g., 2 minutes) or include a second spin without buffer (dry spin) to ensure complete removal of the buffer prior to elution."

    "text": "Hello! I’m currently a Masters student in the Padilla-Gamiño Lab and part of the School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences at the University of Washington in Seattle. Please reach out if you have any questions or are interested in connecting!\n\n1 Research Interests\nMy research focuses on the multiple stressor impacts of microplastic-associated pollution and heat stress on coastal primary producers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy overarching thesis explores the question “Does pollution undermine climate resilience?”\n\n\n\nI’m interested in exploring this question in the context of marine coastal habitat-forming organisms. These include scleractinian corals that form the structures of tropical coral reefs, soft-bodied anemones that cover the rocky intertidal habitats of the temperate coasts, and canopy-forming and understory kelps and seaweeds that provide habitat and organic carbon to various ecosystems.\nOther questions I like to explore are “Do microplastic-associated pollutants alter the beneficial microbiome in marine organisms?”, “Do microplastic pollutants alter gene expression in marine organisms?”, and “Do microplastic pollutants decrease photosynthetic efficiency in the ocean?”.\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n    \n     LinkedIn\n  \n  \n    \n     Github\n  \n  \n    \n     Email Me\n  \n\n\n\n\n2 Research Influences\nI first began circling the issue of plastic pollution and marine debris in 2012 as an intern with the Alaska Dept. of Fish & Game at a remote Steller sea lion rookery near Dixon Entrance. During population surveys, I photographed sea lions entangled in plastic trash, and later worked with the Pinniped Entanglement Group (PEG) to research biodegradable alternatives to plastic packing bands on fish boxes. I learned how difficult it is to amend a system reliant on plastic.\nMore recently, a seminar taught by my advisor Dr. Padilla-Gamiño raised my awareness of the links between the fossil fuel industry, petrochemical-based plastics pollution, and the need for a plastics circular economy. Throughout the seminar, I was heavily influenced by a documentary titled, “The Story of Plastic” and a number of papers, including: “Rethinking Microplastics as a Diverse Contaminant Suite” (Rochman et al. 2019), and “Plastic leachates impair growth and oxygen production in Prochlorococcus, the ocean’s most abundant photosynthetic bacteria” (Tetu et al. 2019).\n\nRochman, Chelsea M., Cole Brookson, Jacqueline Bikker, Natasha Djuric, Arielle Earn, Kennedy Bucci, Samantha Athey, et al. 2019. “Rethinking Microplastics as a Diverse Contaminant Suite.” Environ Toxicol Chem 38 (4): 703–11. https://doi.org/10.1002/etc.4371.\n\nTetu, Sasha G., Indrani Sarker, Verena Schrameyer, Russell Pickford, Liam D. H. Elbourne, Lisa R. Moore, and Ian T. Paulsen. 2019. “Plastic Leachates Impair Growth and Oxygen Production in Prochlorococcus, the Ocean’s Most Abundant Photosynthetic Bacteria.” Commun Biol 2 (May): 184. https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-019-0410-x.\nThe release of Rachel Carson’s book Silent Spring in the early 1960s publicly unified two distinct branches of science, ecology and toxicology, into a new area called “ecotoxicology.”\nPhthalates are known endocrine-disrupting chemicals, which can have strong effects even at very low doses. This ecotoxicology concept is referred to as ‘low-dose effects’ and ‘non-monotonic’ response and was introduced to me by Dr. Alison Gardell as a guest-lecturer to a course in Integrated Environmental Physiology taught by Dr. Steven Roberts at the University of Washington in Seattle.\nI became increasingly interested in studying these types of environmental pollutants because they challenge the concept of ‘acceptable levels of pollution’. A book by Dr. Max Liboiron, titled Pollution is Colonialism, (Liboiron 2021)taught me that ‘acceptable levels of pollution’ assumes settler and colonial access to Indigenous land and is not, in fact, acceptable.\n\nLiboiron, Max. 2021. Pollution Is Colonialism. Duke University Press. https://doi.org/10.2307/j.ctv1jhvnk1.\n\n\n\nThis is me measuring out some filtered seawater at the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology (HIMB) in preparation for my pilot study on phthalate impacts on coral embryo development\n\n\n\n“There is suffering in the world, in the work each of us is doing, we have chosen not to look away, but to do what is in our power to heal and repair, and I see that in every single one of you.” - Dr. Anne Beaudreau, SMEA 500 Autumn 2023"

Kellogg. 2021. “Comparison of Preservation and Extraction Methods on Five Taxonomically Disparate Coral Microbiomes.” Frontiers in Marine Science 8. https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2021.684161.\n\n\n\n\n\n” The V4 variable region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified using the 515F (5′-­GTGCCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA-­3′) and 806R (5′-­GGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT-­3′) primer set (Caporaso et al. 2011). ” - (Brown et al. 2021)\n\nBrown, Tanya, Dylan Sonett, Jesse R.

The sequence homology between the primers and coral DNA was low, with only 7 of 21 bp matching in 63F and 7 of 20 bp matching in 1542R (Fig. 1). With such low binding strength, limited coral DNA amplification was expected. In addition, any coral 18S rRNA gene that was amplified would result in an amplicon length of 0.6 kbp, whereas bacterial 16S rRNA genes would have an amplicon length of 1.5 kbp. Test results indicated that during PCR, coral rRNA genes were amplified and appeared as a distinct band on the gel (Fig. 2, lane 3). This clear separation between coral and bacterial DNA allowed the isolation of the bacterial rRNA genes for further analysis. ” - (Galkiewicz and Kellogg 2008)\n\nGalkiewicz, Julia P., and Christina A.

Sterile clippers were used to remove an approximately 1-cm diameter region from the coral tissue. The tissue clipping was placed in 500 μL of DNA/RNA shield (Zymo Cat #R1100-50) with 0.5 mm glass beads (Fisher Scientific Cat #15-340-152) and homogenized by vortexing for 1 minute. The supernatant (450 μl) was transferred to a new tube and centrifuged at 9000 rcf for 3 min to remove any debris. The supernatant (300 μl) was mixed with 30 μl of Proteinase K (Zymo Cat #D3001-2-20) digestion buffer and 15 μl of Proteinase K in a new tube using a brief vortex step. Equal volume of Zymo lysis buffer (Zymo Cat #D7001-1-200) was added (345 μl) and extraction was completed as outlined in the manufacturer’s protocol. RNA concentration was quantified using the Qubit RNA Broad Range kit (Invitrogen Cat #Q10211) and integrity was assayed with an Agilent TapeStation 4200 system and the RNA Integrity Number (RIN) values ranged from 7.0–8.9. RNA libraries were prepared using the Zymo-Seq RiboFree Total RNA Library Kit (Zymo Cat #R3000) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, starting with 125 ng of RNA as input.

The reason for this is that the NanoDrop will almost always over-“calculate” your sample concentrations (both RNA and DNA). The reason for this is that the NanoDrop is a spectrophotometer and measures light absorbance. With almost all DNA/RNA isolations, there will be residual DNA or RNA in your sample. The NanoDrop cannot distinguish between the two molecules, because they’re both made up of the same material; nucleotides. Nucleotides, regardless of their of their origin will absorb light at an average wavelength of 260nm.Since the Qubit assays use molecule-specific dyes, the dye will only bind to DNA or only to RNA. The dyes will not bind to any carryover of other types of molecules in the sample, so the accuracy (and sensitivity) is much, much higher than the NanoDrop.\n\n\n\n\n4.10.0.3 21-APR-2023\n\nmet with JPG April 1on1\n\ntalked about travel from Sept. 12 - Oct 9th, missing first 2 weeks of Autumn ’23 quarter, focusing that quarter on writing & analysis\nGOAL: have all sequences (16S & Transcriptomes) by September 1st 2023\nInitial 20 samples extracted & sent for sequencing before FHL\n2nd committee meeting to be held once initial 20 samples are run through 1st analysis for 16S & DGE, get advice on strategy for selecting remaining samples\nFollow-up samples extracted & sent for sequencing in July/August\nSend draft letter for NAH experiential learning fund to JPG on Monday April 24th\n\nInitial test round 2 samples extracted!!!\n\n3-CA1a\n3-Ea\n\nSampes selected from extr1 using a random number generator\ndetails can be found in the coral-DNA-RNA-lab-extractions repository\n\n\n\n\n\n4.10.0.4 20-APR-2023\n\ndownloaded fastq files for ‘fake data’ to continue script for bioinformatics workflow\nReceived Mortexer!

There will be Restrictive Periods during which no one will be able to process purchase orders or obtain reimbursements in ARIBA. Exceptions may be made for urgent or emergency purchases. Travel reimbursements and non-travel-related reimbursements should be submitted before June 9th, and processing will resume on July 5th.

This is the beginning of my exploration of using GitHub to jot down thoughts, record ‘daily bits’, and organize the procedures and methods I’ll use in my thesis research\nzbengt introduced me to ‘elicit’, a lit review search AI. I searched “What is the role of endocrine signaling in cnidarian development” and found an exciting paper titled “Sea Anemones Responding to Sex Hormones, Oxybenzone, and Benzyl Butyl Phthalate: Transcriptional Profiling and in Silico Modelling Provide Clues to Decipher Endocrine Disruption in Cnidarians” authored by Morgan et al. in 2022\nI explored another AI, ChatGPT, and gave it the prompt “write me a poem about corals and oysters and mothers” and it returned:\n\n\nCoral reefs, a vibrant sea of life, A home for countless creatures, rife. Oysters, clams, and mussels too, All nestled safe, their shells in view.\nBut danger lurks, the waters warm, The coral bleaches, it’s colors torn. Mother Nature’s wrath, a sight to see, But we can help, if only we believe.\nFor mothers, fierce and loving beasts, Will do what it takes, to protect at least. Their young and home, with all their might, They’ll fight and strive, through day and night.\nSo let us join, in their noble quest, To save the reefs, and all the rest. For oysters, corals, and mothers too, Deserve a chance, to make it through.\n\n\nI followed up with a ChatGPT prompt “what are examples of endocrine signaling in cnidarians?” and it returned:\n\n\nEndocrine signaling is the process of communicating information from one cell to another by releasing hormones into the circulatory system or through direct contact. In cnidarians, endocrine signaling can be used for a variety of functions, including the regulation of growth, development, and behavior.\nOne example of endocrine signaling in cnidarians is the release of growth hormones, which stimulate the growth and development of cells and tissues. For example, in some species of cnidarians, the release of growth hormones is regulated by the action of a hormone called insulin-like growth factor (IGF).\nAnother example of endocrine signaling in cnidarians is the regulation of reproductive function. In some species of cnidarians, hormones called gonadotropins are released by the endocrine cells of the gonads (sex organs) to stimulate the production and release of gametes (sex cells).\nEndocrine signaling is also involved in the regulation of behavior in cnidarians. For example, some species of cnidarians release hormones called neuropeptides that act on the nervous system to regulate behaviors such as feeding, movement, and response to stimuli.\nOverall, endocrine signaling plays a vital role in the regulation of various functions in cnidarians, including growth, development, and behavior.\n\n\n\n​**Is this is all true!? I’ll have to follow-up with my own dive into primary literature…\n\nAnother ChatGPT AI response, when asked the same questions, but prompted to provide references:\n\n\nExamples of endocrine signaling in cnidarians include the release of hormones in response to stimuli such as touch, temperature changes, and changes in light intensity.\nFor example, the hormone adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (ACAP) is released from cnidocytes in response to a variety of stimuli and activates adenylate cyclase, leading to the production of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and the regulation of various physiological processes.\nOther signaling molecules that have been identified in cnidarians include cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), inositol triphosphate (IP3), and Ca2+-dependent signaling pathways.\nReferences:\nLevitan, D. R., & Kohn, A. B. (2001). The Endocrine System of Cnidarians. Annual Review of Physiology, 63(1), 319-344.\nSchmid, V., & Pfründner, R. (1995).

    "text": "On Monday, March 18th, 2024 we collected Anthopleura elegantissima from Owen’s Beach at Point Defiance Park in Tacoma, Washington under WDFW scientific collection permit Tanja 24-010. It was a beautiful day, and the ‘Mountain was out’, gowned in snowy white against a blue sky; not a single cloud. It was the kind of spring day that makes people of the 47th latitude giddy. The collections encompassed the low tide, between 18:27 and 19:40, corresponding to a +1ft MLLW to +0.9ft MLLW tide height (determined by nearest tide station, 9446484) at time of collection. We collected 7 anemones from 12 distinct aggregates. The collections were done efficiently by hand using metal scoopulas1 to gently nudge under the pedal disc of an anemone, and further work under the pedal disc to loosen it from its’ substrate. Once freed, the anemones were transferred in polypropylene mesh bags labelled with their aggregate number (1-12) to a cooler with seawater. One anemone from each aggregate was immediately snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. This was done to preserve an environmental control with which to compare any microbiome changes that may occur due to the transfer from the intertidal zone to the lab. The remaining 6 anemones from each aggregate were transferred to individual 60mm petri dishes that had been acid-washed, and labelled with lab pressure tape and sharpie. The anemones, set in their new petri-dish homes, were placed in a recirculating seawater table in the Padilla-Gamino Lab located at the University of Washington in Seattle by 22:00, just 4 hours post collection. The frozen specimens were stored in the Padilla-Gamino Lab - 80 o C freezer for later processing.\nThe remainder of this post will provide tables and photos detailing the location of the collection sites and documenting the tremendous gift of friendship I have in those who were willing to ‘come poke anemones with me’.\n## install packages\nif (!require(\"tidyverse\", character.only = TRUE)) { install.packages(\"tidyverse\")}\nif (!require(\"kableExtra\", character.only = TRUE)) { install.packages(\"kableExtra\")}\nif (!require(\"leaflet\", character.only = TRUE)){ install.packages(\"leaflet\")}\n## load libraries\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(kableExtra)\nlibrary(leaflet)"

I think because the north-facing beach is protected from the hot afternoon sun. In Washington summers, the hottest part of the day is usually around ~5PM, where we found the anemones, they would be shaded by the sandstone and clay bluff of Point Defiance in the hot summer evenings.\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you to all the friends that helped with this collection! And thank you to the anemones, for donating their bodies to science, we promise to treat you each with gentleness as we conduct our ecotoxicology experiments."

If there was no mixing, a high oxygen ‘bubble’ or ‘lens’ immediately around the organism (due to photosynthesis in photorespiration) or a low oxygen ‘lens’ in dark respiration may occur, and the oxygen optode won’t pick up that signal because it’s trapped!Chambers have to hold a volume ~200-250 mL\nAirtight, & no bubbles!\nAn airtight port for the PreSens dipper oxygen optode (has an OD of ~3.8mm)\nNo port needed for temp probe2\n2 I called Mark Rowland (the USA sales rep for PreSens) and spoke with him on the phone at length about my experiment and the PresSens oxygen setup for respirometry that our lab uses (Fibox 4 with oxygen dipper probes and temp probes). He shared with me that if you are running a controlled experiment in a water bath, and the whole thing is ‘isothermal’, you don’t need to have the temp probes in the chamber with the organism(s) you are testing. As long as the probes are in the same temperature bath that the chambers are submerged in, the data will be recording the temperature of the bath, and correcting the optodes in accordance with the recorded temperatures. This was very useful information as our alternate experimental chambers have 2 ports (one for the oxygen optode, and one for the temp probe), which doubles the potential for air leaks. In this design, I opted to simplify, follow Mark Rowland’s advice, and simply include 1 port for the dipper oxygen optode"

The best way to go about it is to use a hand drill and a metal round tube with your target diameter (here I use a 4mm OD brass tubing) to ‘punch’ the hole through with slow speed and soapy water lubrication. Most of the online advice was tailored to rubber plugs, not silicone, and therefore encourage you to use a bench grinder to sharpen the edge of the metal tube to a cutting angle. This didn’t work for me, and made the edges of the punch irregular. Because I was using a softer material, silicone, and I was drilling a very small hole, I found I didn’t need to ‘sharpen’ the edges of the metal tube.\nDrill ~16mm hole in WECK glass lid :\nWEAR SAFETY GLASSES. Using a drill press, I inserted the 5/8 in diamond tip hole saw in the drill press chuck and positioned the glass lid on riser-spacers so that the bit could pass clean through. I secured the lid very gently in a horiznotal vice that was mounted to the drill press table. Once I think I tightened the vice a skosh4 too much, and the lid shattered when I contacted it with the hole saw bit. Secure it very lightly, just enough so that it can’t rotate when the hole saw bit comes into contact with the surface. The WECK glass lids can contain a shallow ‘well’ of water which was very useful during drilling. I simply filled the upper surface of the lid with soapy water, and that served as lubrication while I drilled. I drilled extremely slowly, barely pressing down (just letting the dead weight of my arm press down on the bit). When the hole saw eventually passes all the way through the glass lid, carefully sweep up glass waste and dispose of safely.\n\n4 The very smallest unit of fake measure, smaller than both the smidge and the tad"

The process by which light energy is transformed into chemical energy (aka sugar energy!). Photosynthesis is the original tool that cyanobacteria used to start the Great Oxygenation Event 2.4 billion years ago.1 It is effectively the only source of molecular oxygen that supports higher life.\n1 #wedidn’tstartthefire\n“The most important thing as far as astrobiologists are concerned is the fact that there are no known abiotic mechanisms of producing an O2-rich atmosphere. If we find a planet with O2 in its atmosphere, would be forced to conclude that life was the cause.

The oxygen and sugar molecules that travel through our blood were made by cyanobacteria, algae, and plants. For how important this process is, it’s so often overlooked or skimmed past. In this post, I will take a deep dive. So grab a cup of tea and a sketch pad and take a deep breath. We’re going under!\nPhotosynthesis occurs in two out of three Domains of life: Bacteria (cyanobacteria, (a.k.a. blue-green algae) & Eukarya (red, brown, & green algae & plants!) Archaea, the third Domain, is made up of a group of single-celled microorganisms that do not photosynthesize. Here, I will focus mostly on the marine endosymbionts that form symbioses with marine invertebrates.\n\n1.1 Primary endosymbiosis\nThe evolution of the chloroplast can be traced back to when an alphaproteobacterium engulfed a cyanobacterium. This event is called the ‘primary endosymbiosis’ and is illustrated in the diagram below by a green pac-man shape (the alphaproteobacterium) engulfing a blue football-shaped cyanobacterium. Primary endosymbiosis resulted in plastids (here plastids mean chloroplasts and mitochondria) that are bounded by two membranes. The lineage of primary endosymbiosis diverged into three: red algae, green algae, and glaucophytes.\nThe green algae are thus products of primary endosymbiosis and are characterized by two layers of membranes around their plastids. This includes their chloroplasts.\n\n\n\nScreenshot from P.J. Keeling(Keeling 2010) , Figure 2.

Individual anemones will be collected from each of 12 clonal aggregates by very gently scraping their pedal disc to separate it from their attached substrate. We will move 5 meters or more to what we can assume is a genetically distinct aggregate and repeat this, until we have 7 individuals from each of 12 clonal mats (a total of 84 individuals). One individual from each aggregate will be immediately flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen to serve as an environmental baseline control for both microbial and gene expression metrics. The remaining 72 anemones will be kept for experimentation.\n\n\n4.3 Specimen housing & acclimation\nThe anemones will be transported in sea water from the collection site back to the University of Washington campus where they will be housed individually in labelled glass beakers that will be submerged in a recirculating seawater table and allowed to acclimate for at least 2 weeks to heal their pedal disc.\n\n\n4.4 Treatment preparation\nWe will prepare plastic leachate in seawater as a treatment by soaking 250mg of plastic in 250ml of seawater in a glass beaker for 1 week with a stir-bar or shaker table. The 100% leachate that is formed from this soak has a known phthalate acid ester (PAE) concentration of ~10%, equaling 100mg of PAE per 250ml of seawater. This highly concentrated leachate will be diluted 1:1000 in filtered seawater to get to an environmentally relevant concentration of 100ug of PAE per liter of seawater.\n\n\n4.5 Experiment\nThe experiment will be setup as a 2x3 factorial design to test thermal stress and plastic leachate. Two seawater tables will be used as temperature baths, one set at an elevated temperature of 20\\(^{\\circ}\\)C and another at an ambient temperature of 10\\(^{\\circ}\\)C. Temperature will be controlled by an Apex Neptune Aquarium controller coupled to heat exchangers and light level will be standardized using Kessil aquarium lights. 20 specimens (two of each clonal mat) will be randomly placed in one of each water temperature treatment bath. Seatable water volume level will be dropped to just below the lip of the specimen beakers, and specimen beakers will be filled with either filtered seawater or with the dilute plastic seawater leachate treatment. The exposure will last 48 hours, after which anemones will be flash frozen in liquid nitrogen.\n\n\n\nFigure 2. 2x3 Factorial experimental design in which 1 clonal genotype from each of 10 clonal mats will be exposed to 4 scenarios, thermal stress, plastic leachate pollution, multiple/combined thermal and leachate pollution stresses, and the control of ambient temp and filtered seawater.\n\n\n\n\n4.6 Sample Processing\nFlash frozen samples will be processed using the commercial Zymo Dual DNA/RNA MiniPrep kit to extract microbial DNA and host and symbiont RNA. The microbial DNA data will be used to analyze if there are any discernible shifts in the microbiome related to the treatments. The RNA will help us identify molecular pathways that may be disrupted by heat, leachate, and/or the combined multiple stressors of both in a cnidarian and its algal symbiont.\n\n\n4.7 Merit\nThis shotgun of stress response variables will serve to offer a holistic view of cnidarian host and algal symbiont physiological response to temperature and plastic pollution leachate stress. It is well known that ocean heat waves are becoming more frequent and intense. Simultaneously, marine plastic pollution is becoming more prevalent and the chemical additives associated with plastic have become ubiquitous in our environments. As plastics weather mechanically, they also weather chemically by leaching additives not covalently bonded to the plastic polymer resins (Hahladakis et al. 2018). The most common plastic additives are a group of chemicals called plasticizers, also known as phthalates or phthlate acid esters (PAE). They are commonly added to PVC to increase flexibility and durability. However, phthlatates are known to mimic or interfere with hormones that control developmental, reproductive, and immune response in both humans and animals (maqboolReviewEndocrineDisorders2016?). Previous research shows that plastic leachates experimentally added to plants, bacteria, and algae impair growth, reduce photosynthesis, and shift microbial communities in lab studies (capolupo2020?; O’Brien et al. 2022; Tetu et al. 2019). However, little is known about environmental concentrations of plastic leachate in the context of increasing ocean temperatures. Marine heatwaves, plastic manufacturing, and pollution are predicted to increase (macleodGlobalThreatPlastic2021?; oliverMarineHeatwaves2021?). Therefore, it is urgent that we understand how thermal stress and plastic pollution interact and the effects they may have on coastal marine organisms, which are likely experiencing both the most extreme thermal stress and the highest amount of plastic pollution.\n\n\n\n\n\nHahladakis, John N., Costas A.

    "text": "What information can we get from looking at the Montipora capitata embryos that were exposed to varying levels of PVC leachate (High: 1mg/L, Mid: 0.1mg/L, Low: 0.01mg/L)? This experiment allowed embryos to develop from a bundle-bundle cross (meaning one egg-sperm bundle from one parent colony was placed in a 20mL scintillation vial with another egg-sperm bundle from a different parent colony). Colonies are not known to be able to self-fertilize… meaning it’s important that each bundle came from a different parent colony. Each Montipora capitata egg sperm bundle contains a ‘bundle’ of eggs that are bound together around a ‘packet’ of sperm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nEach egg-sperm bundle contains 15 +/- 5.1 oocytes (mean +/- SD, n = 214, from 26 colonies) (Padilla-Gamiño et al. 2011)\n\n\n\nPadilla-Gamiño, J.

This could provide insight into fertilization success ratios for bundle-bundle cross experiments, but may not be applicable to oceanic conditions, where there is sperm competition, mixing, and greater potential for dilution\nAnswer: We will only assess fertilization success at the point of cleavage, where presumably, we will still see the unfertilized oocytes (any eggs that have not cleaved). In the prawn chip and early gastrula phases, the unfertilized eggs have already dissolved. In these phases, we will assess embryo mortality based on the fertilization rates we find from the cleavage data.\nQuestion #2: How should we treat fragmented embryos? I can tell by the cell structure that they made it to a certain phase… but I can’t tell how many fragments make up one whole embryo (count data). Should we count the fragmented embryos? Are they fragmented, or are they deformed (abnormalities?)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvariable\nunit/type\nstatistical test\n\n\n\n\nDevelopmental stage\ncell stage, ordinal categorical variable\nChi-Square Goodness of Fit or Log-Likelihood Ratio\n\n\nproportion of abnormality per cross\nratio, continuous variable\nLog-Likelihood Ratio\n\n\nproportion of abnormality per treatment\nratio, continuous variable\nLog-Likelihood Ratio\n\n\nproportion of fertilization success\nratio, continuous variable\nLog-Likelihood Ratio\n\n\n\nFor every embryo in every sample we have:\n\nEmbryo stage (cell stage, ordinal categorical variable)\nEmbryo status (typical/malformed, binary categorical variable)\n\nWith this data we can assess for each sample:\n\nEmbryo counts (counts of embryos in each stage and status)\nEmbryo proportions (proportions of embryos in each stage and status)\n\nAcross samples we want to analyze for:\n\nTiming\nAbnormality\nSurvival"

A general model fitting function for concentration/dose response models was applied using the package drc from R 2.11© software and the EC50, EC20 and EC10 calculated. After transformation, data on fertilization success (%) were analyzed using one-way ANOVA and post hoc Tukey comparisons to detect any significant differences (p &lt; 0.05) among the treatments. One-way ANOVA and post hoc Tukey comparisons were also used to determine significant differences in eggs per bundle and egg size among the different spawning times.\nThe fertilization rates in the untreated controls were relatively high for all the experiments, ranging from 86% to 96% (Fig. 1), with the exception of the last experiment performed on August 1st, 2008, where almost no fertilization (&lt;10%) was observed in either control and experimental vials. ”"

A beta regression model (formula=proportion∼cleavage stage+treatment+cleavage stage:treatment) was used to analyze differences in the proportion of cells at each cleavage stage and treatment using the betareg R package (v3.1-4; Cribari-Neto and Zeileis, 2010). Differences between cleavage stages and treatments were then computed using the joint_tests function from the emmeans R package (v1.4.4; https://cran-r-project-org.offcampus.lib.washington.edu/package=emmeans), which effectively runs the beta regression model as a type III ANOVA. Additionally, a one-way nested ANOVA analysis tested the effect of tank on embryo and planula size wherein tank ID was nested within treatment. After determining that tank effects were non-significant (P&gt;0.05), one-way ANOVA analysis was used to test for the effect of treatment on fertilized embryo, gastrula and planula volume. Post hoc Tukey HSD tests were conducted when the effect of treatment was significant (P&lt;0.05). Data were visually examined for normal distribution and equal variance. The dependent variable was square-root transformed for the gastrulation and planula life stages in order to meet statistical assumptions prior to ANOVA analysis.

Our chemical analyses show that leachates from beached pellets (biobead and nurdle pellets) and highly plasticised industrial pellets (PVC) contain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and polychlorinated biphenyls, which are known to be detrimental to development and other life stages of animals. We also demonstrate that these microplastic leachates elicit severe, consistent and treatment-specific developmental abnormalities in P. lividus at embryonic and larval stages. Those embryos exposed to virgin polyethylene leachates with no additives nor environmental contaminants developed normally, suggesting that the abnormalities observed are the result of exposure to either environmentally adsorbed contaminants or pre-existing industrial additives within the polymer matrix. In the light of the chemical contents of the leachates and other characteristics of the plastic particles used, we discuss the phenotypes observed during our study, which include abnormal gastrulation, impaired skeletogenesis, abnormal neurogenesis, redistribution of pigmented cells and embryo radialisation (rendell-bhatti2021?).\n\nThis study used the same leachate preparation and concentrations as above."

Fertilized eggs were exposed to environmental and high PAE concentrations for 72 h. The potential toxic effects on larval development and any morphological anomalies were then assessed to estimate PAEs impact. Environmental concentrations never affected development, while high concentrations induced toxic effects in larvae exposed to BBP (EC50: 2.9 ×103 μg/L) and DEHP (EC50: 3.72 ×103 μg/L). High concentrations caused skeletal anomalies, with a slight to moderate impact for DEP/DEHP and BBP, respectively. PAE toxicity was: BBP&gt;DEHP&gt;DEP. In conclusion, the three PAEs at environmental concentrations do not pose a risk to sea urchins. However, PAE concentrations should be further monitored in order not to constitute a concern to marine species, especially at their early developmental stages. - (gambardella2024?)"

We compared the efficiency of two test procedures, and evaluated the toxicity of beached pellets collected in a coastal marine protected area. We observed that mussel embryo is sensitive to leachate from both virgin and beached pellets. However, the toxicity of the leachate from beached pellets was much higher than that of virgin pellets. We suggest contaminants adsorbed onto the surface of beached pellets were responsible for the high toxicity of leachate from beached pellets, while the toxicity of leachate from virgin pellets was mainly due to plastic additives. Our results suggest microplastic debris may be harmful even if ingestion is not the only or main pathway of interaction of marine organisms with contaminated plastic debris. - (gandaraesilva2016?)"

In this study, blue mussels were exposed for seven days to both single and combined stressors (i.e., +3 ◦C elevated temperature and two environmentally relevant concentrations of the plastic softener DEHP, 0.5 and 50 μg/l) in a factorial design. Males were observed to be more sensitive to high temperature, demonstrated by the significant increase in out-of-season spawning gonads and higher gene expression of the antioxidant catalase and the estrogen receptor genes. On the other hand, while the gametogenesis cycle in females was more resilient than in males, DEHP exposure altered the estrogen-related receptor gene expression. We show that the combined stressors DEHP and increased temperature, in environmentally relevant magnitudes, have different consequences in male and female mussels, with the potential to impact the timing and breeding season success in Mytilus spp. - (mincarelli2021?)"

    "text": "6.1 Plastic leachate-induced toxicity during sea urchin embryonic development: Insights into the molecular pathways affected by PVC\n\nHere we investigate the effects of leachates from new and beach-collected pellets on the embryonic and larval development of the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus and demonstrate that exposure of developing embryos to these leachates elicits severe, consistent and treatment-specific developmental abnormalities including radialisation of the embryo and malformation of the skeleton, neural and immune cells. Using a multi-omics approach we define the developmental pathways disturbed upon exposure to PVC leachates and provide a mechanistic view that pinpoints cellular redox stress and energy production as drivers of phenotypic abnormalities following exposure to PVC leachates. Analysis of leachates identified high concentrations of zinc that are the likely cause of these observed defects. Our findings point to clear and specific detrimental effects of marine plastic pollution on the development of echinoderms, demonstrating that chemicals leached from plastic particles into sea water can produce strong developmental abnormalities via specific pathways, and therefore have the potential to impact on a wide range of organisms. (paganos2023a?) (Abstract)\n\n\nused nurdle beach pellets collected from Cornwall, UK & pre-production commercial PVC nurdles\n\n\nThese results are consistent with those observed previously in P. lividus, where beached and PVC pellet leachates elicited changes including abnormal gastrulation, impaired skeletogenesis, abnormal neurogenesis and embryo radialisation (Rendell-Bhatti et al., 2020), indicating that these types of developmental abnormalities may not be species-specific but affect the whole clade similarly. The PVC treatment-induced phenotype was of particular interest as it clearly resembles the one obtained when the specification of the secondary axis of the sea urchin embryo (oral-aboral) is disturbed. Similar to our P. lividus data (Rendell-Bhatti et al., 2020), embryos exposed to PVC leachates are unable to produce a proper skeleton. In normal gastrula embryos, skeletogenic cells are spatially organised around the archenteron, forming a syncytium to which biominerals are deposited (Fig. 2. E). At the pluteus stage, the larval skeleton consists of different skeletal rods that are responsible for the characteristic shape of the larvae (Fig. 2. F). PVC leachate-treated S. purpuratus gastrulae seem to be missing differentiated skeletogenic cells as indicated by the absence of the skeletal marker MSP130 immunoreactivity (Fig. 2. I), while the same marker at 72 hpf reveals the presence of radialised syncytium of differentiated skeletogenic cells (Fig. 2. J). Another visible abnormality of the treated larvae is the absence of a well-formed ciliary band, an observation confirmed by the β-tubulin staining showing a reduced ciliary surface when compared to controls (Fig. 2. G, H). Esophageal muscles originate from myoblasts that at gastrula stage populate the tip of the embryonic foregut and at the pluteus stage they differentiate towards circumesophageal muscles controlling the contraction of the sea urchin esophageal region and therefore feeding (Andrikou et al., 2013, 2015). Immunohistochemical staining for the esophageal muscles marker Sp-MHC revealed that exogastrulated larvae are lacking any muscular structure suggesting that exogastrulation impaired muscle development (Fig. 2. K, L). In the Rendell-Bhatti et al. (2020) study we found PCB and PAH in the leachates of environmental samples, and PAH and HCB in PVC leachates, which we suggested were the possible causes of the malformations observed (Rendell-Bhatti et al., 2020). We had not observed exogastrulas before, but another study had found otherwise well-formed P. lividus pluteus larvae with everted gut rudiments when exposed to micronized plastic toys (Oliviero et al., 2019). However, the phenotypes here observed in the PVC treatments clearly mirror phenotypes from classical and new experiments exposing S. purpuratus and other sea urchins to heavy metals (Mitsunaga and Yasumasu, 1984; Kobayashi and Okamura, 2004; Cunningham et al., 2020), as well as to oral-aboral axis formation disorganisation (Duboc et al., 2004). Indeed, we see radialised/oralised embryos similar to those described when the developmental pathways involved in oral/aboral (O/A) and left/right (L/R) axis formation are disrupted (Duboc et al., 2004, 2008). These results prompted us to investigate what transcriptomic changes were taking place in the embryos to be able to identify the mechanisms by which the plastic leachates were affecting development.

    "text": "7.1 Transcriptional responses of Acropora hyacinthus embryo under the benzo(a)pyrene stress by deep sequencing\n\nAbstract\nCoral embryos are a critical and sensitive period for the early growth and development of coral. Benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) is widely distributed in the ocean and has strong toxicity, but there is little information on the toxic effects to coral embryos exposed to this widespread environmental contaminant. Thus, in this study, we utilized the Illumina Hiseq™ 4000 platform to explore the gene response of Acropora hyacinthus embryos under the BaP stress. A total of 130,042 Unigenes were obtained and analyzed, and approximately 37.67% of those matched with sequences from four different species. In total, 2606 Unigenes were up-regulated, and 3872 Unigenes were down-regulated. After Gene Ontology (GO) annotation, the results show that the “cellular process” and “metabolic process” were leading in the category of biological processes, which the “binding” and “catalytic activity” were the most abundant subcategories in molecular function. Based on the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis, the most differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were enriched, as well as down-regulated in the pathways of oxidative phosphorylation, metabolism of xenobiotics, immune-related genes, apoptosis and human disease genes. At the same time, 388,197 of Single-nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) and 6164 of Simple Sequence Repeats (SSRs) were obtained, which can be served as the richer and more valuable SSRs molecular markers in the future. The results of this study can help to better understand the toxicological mechanism of coral embryo exposed to BaP, and it is also essential for the protection and restoration of coral reef ecosystem in the future."

These samples are ‘snapshots’ of the corals after they were collected from Kaneohe Bay and fragmented to ~3cm nubbins\nModifications incorporated:\n\nAdded 500uL DNA/RNA Shield to bead bashing tube before adding powdered sample\nAfter adding the powdered sample, I added another 1000uL of DNA/RNA Shield and vortexed with a quick pulse to submerge all of the powdered sample\n1Transferred 600uL of supernatent from bead bashing tube to nuclease-free tube after Mortexing, and saved the bead-bashing tube with remaining ~400uL of homogenized tissue in DNA/RNA Shield as backup\nTransferred 350uL of PK Digested sample to a new tube, saved the leftover PK Digested tube sample as backup\nAdded a dry spin for 2min after the last wash buffer spin to ensure complete removal of wash buffer\neluted 270uL of DNA & 60uL RNA in Hyclone nuclease-free water (expired Oct 2021..?)\n\n\n1 Before this extraction, I had been conducted PK Digestion in the bead bashing tube. I got some advice that this could be contaminating the purity of the RNA:\nJerry Yu from Zymo says:\n\n“We are worried about the sample debris remaining in the tube, which should still contain protein. One of the reasons for Proteinase K treatment at this step is to break down protein in the solution to make it less viscous/sticky, so the column can process it without issue. By transferring the mixture out, the treatment could be more efficient.”\n\n2 Kind of arbitrary.. trying to hit something between 100 and 50 microliters"

    "text": "10.3 Notes\n\nextractions were started by SST and NAH and finished by SST on 21-APR-2023 ::: column-margin  :::\n3-CA1a pestled 1st, half of the material in the cryo vial was used. Half remains in the freezer.\n3-Ea pestled 2nd, all of the material in the cryo vial was used, but half fell on the floor and had to be thrown out.\nLN2 evaporates very quickly and had to be replenished multiple times\nWe did this with two people (NAH to grind, SST to carefully dispense LN2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nThe coral is very hard to pestle and prone to ‘squirting out’ from under the pestle! Learned that it is better to leverage whole body weight above the mortar and work to crush the coral fragment like a hydraulic press. When pestling sample 3-Ea at an angle, half of the fragment shot out of the mortar and ended up on the floor (which was discarded and not used), resulting in less starting material left to use in the mortar. This could be a reason why 3-Ea had ‘out of range, too low’ result for Qubit!\n\n\n\nUsed sterilized scoopula to transfer the sample powder to its correspondingly labelled bead bashing tube.\n\nFor this step we made small disposable funnels from lab weigh-paper and label tape to try and make this easier. ⚠️Unfortunately, this didn’t work very well! ⚠️ Finely ground powder melts fast and the cold from the LN2 means that all the moisture in the lab is condensing on the sample. As soon as it is removed from the mortar by the scoopula it begins to melt , condense water vapor, and turn into a sticky booger! It doesn’t slide nice and dry down the paper funnel. We had to tamp it vigorously to get it into the bead bashing tube.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nFixed the melting booger problem by getting small metal funnels and metal scoopulas and chilling them on dry-ice, with the goal being to keep the powder cold during the transfer from the mortar to inside the bead bashing tube. This worked really well!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfunnel weigh paper diagram\n\n\n\nOnce the sample powder was in the bead bashing tube, we quickly added 750uL of DNA/RNA Sheild to the bead bashing tube, shook it vigorously & vortexed it to ensure the sample was submersed in DNA/RNA Sheild\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nAfter bead beating tube was very very bubbly! Would suggest centrifuging after the bead-beating homogenization ‘shaker’ step prior to opening tube lid and putting it in the bead bashing tube before the sample in future extractions.\n\n\n\nWe then set bead-bashing tubes in the Mortexer and let it mix at max speed for 40 mins\nAdded 30uL of Proteinase-K Digestion Buffer directly to the bead bashing tube\nAdded 15uL of Proteinase-K directly to the bead bashing tube\nIncubated (left to sit) at room temp for 30 minutes\neluted 100ul of DNA in nuclease-free water\neluted 100ul of RNA in nuclease-free water"

Hourly temperature and tide data for Toke Point and Port Townsend and tide data from Neah Bay and Budd Inlet was obtained from publically available National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) tide station data using the ‘rnoaa’ package in R (Chamberlin et al. 2021, R Core Team 2021). Hourly temperature and tide data for Vancouver and tide data for Pruth Bay was obtained from publically available Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) Canada tide station data. Air temperature data for Pruth Bay was obtained from the Hakai Institute weather station (Giesbrecht et al. 2021). Air temperature data for Neah Bay was obtained from a weather station on nearby Tatoosh Island, WA (C. Pfister and T. Wootton personal communication). Air temperature data for Budd Inlet was obtained from the nearby Evergreen State College weather station. If raw data was reported at time scale less than one hour, mean hourly temperature was calculated. These data can be accessed two ways, both of which are available (Raymond, 2022). There, static data files are archived as well as code to query and process them if necessary. Long term, 1991 – 2020, air temperature data was obtained from the National Aeronautical and Space Agency (NASA) DAYMET surface temperature database using the ‘daymetr’ package in R (Hufkens 2021). We extracted maximum and minimum daily surface air temperatures from 2° latitude by 2° longitude grids. Grids were selected by the location of the hourly temperatures/tide stations above.

    "text": "1.2 Research Overview\n\n1.2.1 Motivation\nBroadly, my interest in research is motivated by a desire for a healthy world. This is embodied by the ‘one health’ approach, which recognizes the connections between the health of people, animals, and the environment.\ninfographic sourced from Morrison et al. 2022\n\nMore about Sarah’s background, research interests & motivations can be found in the About page.\n\n\n\n1.2.2 Research Topic Background\nThe goal of my Master’s thesis research is to gain insight into multiple-stressor interactions of warming oceans and plastic pollution on reef-building corals.\nUnder a CMIP6 climate scenario, it is forecasted that more than 75% of coral reefs will experience yearly severe bleaching before 2070 due to thermal stress. However, hope for resilient corals exists. In a prolonged marine heatwave event on Kiritimati Atoll, the largest coral atoll in the world, 100% of the corals near chronic anthropogenic disturbances died, but in areas that were not already stressed, 90% of corals died. The 10% that survived after bleaching are hypothesized to have recovered due to lower baseline levels of stress and better water quality compared to corals near chronic anthropogenic stressors like pollution and overfishing (Claar et al. 2020).\nCorals are threatened by global stressors, strategies for reducing local stressors may give corals an edge on survival\nWhile coral coverage has declined since the 50s, petroleum-derived plastic production and subsequent environmental plastic pollution have rapidly increased. An estimated 8 million tons of plastic and their associated additives end up in the oceans every year, with unknown impacts to important coastal coral reef ecosystems. Plastics are emerging environmental pollutants of growing concern for coral reefs, and are the source of a suite of environmental contaminants and persistent organic pollutants posing unknown risks to human and ecosystem health (Rochman et al. 2019). Plastics are non-biodegradable, persisting in the environment for centuries. UV radiation and mechanical weathering cause them to become brittle and fragment into microplastics &lt;5mm, and nanoplastics &lt;1mm. As plastics weather mechanically, they also weather chemically by leaching additives not covalently bonded to the plastic polymer resins (Hahladakis et al. 2018).\nFigure from Macleod et al. 2021\nThe most common plastic additives are a group of chemicals called plasticizers, also known as phthalates or phthalate acid esters (PAE). They are commonly added to PVC to increase flexibility and durability. Phthalates are known to mimic or interfere with hormones that control developmental, reproductive, and immune response in both humans and animals (Maqbool et al. 2016). Despite the presence of phthalates in 95% of tested coral samples (Montano et al. 2020), little is known about how phthalates interfere with coral physiology and reproduction. Previous research shows that plastic leachates experimentally added to plants, bacteria, and algae impair growth, reduce photosynthesis, and shift microbial communities in lab studies (Capolupo et al. 2020; O’Brien et al. 2022; Tetu et al. 2019).\n** Plastic pollution, and associated PAE pollution,\nMarine heatwaves, plastic manufacturing, and coastal ocean plastic pollution are all predicted to increase (MacLeod et al. 2021; Oliver et al. 2021).\nAs discussed in Claar et al. (2020), the success of coral recovery after bleaching will depend on levels of chronic anthropogenic stressors like pollution.\nI propose to conduct a series of studies that expose coral gametes and coral colonies to the multiple stressors of phthalate pollution and ocean warming, and subsequently measure the physiological responses, holobiont community structure, and gene expression between treatments. {: .notice–info}\nThis proposed research aligns with the mission of the School of Aquatic and Fisheries Sciences at the University of Washington, which is to conduct multidisciplinary research and education in order to understand, conserve, and manage marine ecosystems.\n\nREFERENCES\nCapolupo, Marco, Lisbet Sørensen, Kongalage Don Ranil Jayasena, Andy M.

Of interest is the non-monotonic response (very low PAE concentrations significantly reduced proportion of eggs making it to initial cleavage, and were not significantly different compared to very high concentrations of PAE)\nIn Summary: the PAE-DEVO experiment resulted in a total of 15 samples, with an n=3, and showed significant differences between the control and all treatment groups. This pilot study may be a candidate for publication as a note in a low-impact factor journal like {: .notice–success}\nLimitations: Sample size is low and study replication is difficult because it relies on access to intact M. capitata egg-sperm bundles, and the use of EPA 506 phthalate esters mix 1, which may pose harm to researcher health. If I were to repeat this experiment I would want to make my own leachate out of a common plastic consumer product, similar to the methods used by Tetu et al. 2019. Though this would be safer, it would not provide insight into the actual concentration of PAEs in the treatment. {: .notice–warning}\nNote: I presented this pilot study in a 5-min lighting talk during the AU’22 SAFS Graduate Student Symposium {: .notice–info}\n\n\n1.2.4.2 PAE-TEMP | M. capitata Acute Phthalate & Thermal Stress Exposure\ngraphical methods, JPG suggested simplifying diagram\nIn Summary: the PAE-TEMP experiment resulted in a total of 130 samples, with an n=10, that were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and can be used for DNA/RNA studies. {: .notice–success}\nLimitations: In order to ensure the phthalate concentration was controlled in each treatment, the 20mL scintillation vials were a closed, ‘mesocosm’, and the corals did not receive water changes during the short 48hr exposure. Because of this, I expect we will see degradation between the environmental and experimental control samples. This study can’t account for the fact that corals in Kaneohe Bay may already be exposed to chronic low-levels of PAE pollution, so we can’t say our control baseline is ‘zero PAE exposure’. Replication may be difficult because it relies on the use of EPA 506 phthalate esters mix 1, which may pose harm to researcher health. {: .notice–warning}"

It will be enough for two thesis chapters.\nQ. Which sequencing strategy would be best suited to this project? - Where have you sent samples for sequencing services in the past? - What are reasonable sequencing costs per sample?\nQ. I need support/resources to learn about: - requesting quotes for sequencing (sequencing platform, # of sequences, # of bp, read-length/assay-length) - library preparation\n  &gt; “sequencing libraries are pools of DNA fragments containing adapter sequences compatible with a specific sequencing platform and indexing barcodes for individual sample identification. The main library preparation methods are [ligation-based library preparation](https://www.idtdna.com/pages/technology/next-generation-sequencing/library-preparation/ligation-based-library-prep) tagmentation-based library preparation, and [amplicon library preparation](https://www.idtdna.com/pages/technology/next-generation-sequencing/dna-sequencing/targeted-sequencing/amplicon-sequencing).
