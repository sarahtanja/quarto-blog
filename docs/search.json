    "text": "I’m currently a Masters student in the Padilla-Gamiño Lab and part of the School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences at the University of Washington in Seattle.\nMy research focuses on the multiple stressor impacts of plastic pollution and heat stress on coastal primary producers. More specifically, I am researching a suite of common chemicals added to plastic consumer-products called phthalate acid-esters, phthalates or plasticizers, and their potential impacts on gene transcription, primary productivity, and microbial community structure in corals and kelps.\n\n\nResearch Influences\nI first began circling the issue of plastic pollution and marine debris in 2012 as an intern with the Alaska Dept. of Fish & Game at a remote Steller sea lion rookery near Dixon Entrance. During population surveys, I photographed sea lions entangled in plastic trash, and later worked with the Pinniped Entanglement Group (PEG) to research biodegradable alternatives to plastic packing bands on fish boxes. I learned how difficult it is to amend a system reliant on plastic.\nMore recently, a seminar taught by my advisor Dr. Padilla-Gamiño raised my awareness of the links between the fossil fuel industry, petrochemical-based plastics pollution, and the need for a plastics circular economy. Throughout the seminar, I was heavily influenced by:\n\na documentary, “The Story of Plastic”\na peer-reviewed paper, “Rethinking Microplastics as a Diverse Contaminant Suite” by Chelsea Rochman et. al 2019\n\nPhthalates are known endocrine-disrupting chemicals, which can have strong effects even at very low doses. This ecotoxicology concept is referred to as ‘low-dose effects’ and ‘non-monotonic’ response and was introduced to me by Dr. Alison Gardell as a guest-lecturer to a course in Integrated Environmental Physiology taught by Dr. Steven Roberts at the University of Washington in Seattle.\nI became increasingly interested in studying these types of environmental pollutants because they challenge the concept of ‘acceptable levels of pollution’. A book by Dr. Max Liboiron, titled Pollution is Colonialism, taught me that ‘acceptable levels of pollution’ assumes settler and colonial access to Indigenous land and is not, in fact, acceptable."

If the data do not meet the assumptions of normality required for parametric tests like the paired t-test, but you want to determine if there is a trend between two paired samples, you can use the Wilcoxon paired-sample T test. This is a non-parametric statistical test used to compare two related samples or repeated measures. It is appropriate for this dataset, because each row of DNA and RNA were extracted from the same sample. Here we really want to know if our Dual extraction method is biased toward optimizing yield for DNA or RNA, or if there is any trend at all. > Our null and alternate hypotheses are: H0: There is no trend between the paired samples. H1: There is a trend between the paired samples.\n\nwilcox.test(x=qubit_scores$qubit_dna_avg, y=qubit_scores$qubit_rna_avg, paired=TRUE, alternative = 'two.sided')\n\n\n    Wilcoxon signed rank exact test\n\ndata:  qubit_scores$qubit_dna_avg and qubit_scores$qubit_rna_avg\nV = 86, p-value = 0.498\nalternative hypothesis: true location shift is not equal to 0\n\n\nThe Wilcoxon signed-rank test, as a non-parametric test, determines whether there is a shift or trend in the paired observations but does not provide information about the direction or magnitude of the shift. It only tells you that there is a significant difference between the paired samples, but it does not indicate which sample has higher values or the direction of the shift.\nTo determine the direction of the shift, you would need to examine the data and calculate the median or mean of the paired differences. If the median or mean of the differences is positive, it suggests that the second sample tends to have higher values than the first sample. Conversely, if the median or mean is negative, it indicates that the first sample tends to have higher values than the second sample.\nTo get a better understanding of the direction and magnitude of the shift, you may consider plotting the paired differences or constructing a confidence interval around the median or mean difference. This can provide additional insights into the nature of the shift and help you interpret the results more accurately."

It also facilitates paired sample analysis, where each data point in one dataset is uniquely paired to a data point in the second dataset because we are making duplicate measurements on the same sample.\nThe challenge is lysing the sample enough to get the bacterial DNA (busting open all those layers of cell membranes!) and retaining host (coral) RNA integrity.\nThis protocol follows the Zymo Research Quick-DNA/RNA Mininprep Plus Kit Instruction Manual with help and optimization from URI Putnam Lab Members Open Lab Notebook posts; such as Emma Strand’s notebook post on Zymo-Duet-RNA-DNA-Extraction-Protocol, Kevin Wong’s post on Porites Extractions and M.E.

Work quickly and carefully to sort through the vials and select the ones that you are working with. Nest the selected sample vials in the dry ice, and return the rest back to the -80 freezer. Bring working samples on dry-ice back to the lab bench.\nDon cryo-gloves over nitrile gloves and ⚠️carefully⚠️ dispense a small amount (no more than 1L) of liquid nitrogen (LN2) into the transfer thermos. Everyone working with LN2 should have taken the Liquid Nitrogen Online Safety Course found HERE\nGrind each sample with mortar & pestle on LN2 -\n\n⚠️carefully⚠️ pour a small amount of LN2 into a sterilized mortar\nUsing sterilized forceps, pluck out coral fragments from the cryo vial and place in the mortar until you have as much material as about the size of an M&M (roughly a 16mm diameter sphere). Material amount does not have to be precise.\nPestle the coral fragment until it is ground to a powder. Work quickly to ensure the sample remains frozen. Add more LN2 when it evaporates from the mortar. This step is challenging! LN2 evaporates very quickly and must be replenished multiple times.\n\n\nThe coral is also very hard and prone to ‘squirting out’ from under the pestle\n\n\nLyse: Bead-Bash Samples\n\nUse sterilized scoopula to transfer the sample powder to its correspondingly labelled bead bashing tube\nAim to transfer 500uL of volume to each tube\nAdd 500uL of DNA/RNA Shield to each 2mL (0.1 - 0.5mm) bead-bashing tube with powdered sample and vortex to ensure powder is submersed in DNA/RNA Shield\nSet bead-bashing tubes in Mortexer and vortex at high speed for 40 minutes\n\n\n\nProteinase-K Digestion\n\nAfter bead bashing tubes are ‘intensely bubbly’\nTo tamp down bubbles, centrifuge in the mini-centrifuge for 1-2 minutes\nAdd Proteinase K & Buffer\n\nAdd the appropriate volume of Pro K buffer and Proteinase K (Proteinase K is stored in the -20 after being reconstituted)\n(10:1 ratio of sample:digestion buffer) & (2:1 ratio of digestion buffer:Proteinase K)\nFor tubes with 500uL of DNA/RNA Shield add:\n\n50ul pro k buffer\n25ul proteinase K\n\nIf you have tubes with a larger volume you can scale up the volumes (ex for 700ul, you would use 70ul buffer and 35ul pro k)\n\nIncubate in heat-block for 30mins at 55C\nVortex to mix\nCentrifuge on max for 30s\nTransfer \\(400 \\mu L\\) of the cleared supernatent to a nuclease-free tube\nAdd \\(400 \\mu L\\) of DNA/RNA Lysis Buffer to the supernatent(1:1) and vortex to mix\n\n\n\nPurify DNA & RNA\n\nTransfer the buffered supernatent (should be a total of 800uL, which can be passed through the filter in one go) to yellow Spin-Away Filter in a Collection Tube and centrifuge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDanger\n\n\n\nSave The flow-through in the collection tube for RNA purification!

The reason for this is that the NanoDrop will almost always over-“calculate” your sample concentrations (both RNA and DNA). The reason for this is that the NanoDrop is a spectrophotometer and measures light absorbance. With almost all DNA/RNA isolations, there will be residual DNA or RNA in your sample. The NanoDrop cannot distinguish between the two molecules, because they’re both made up of the same material; nucleotides. Nucleotides, regardless of their of their origin will absorb light at an average wavelength of 260nm.Since the Qubit assays use molecule-specific dyes, the dye will only bind to DNA or only to RNA. The dyes will not bind to any carryover of other types of molecules in the sample, so the accuracy (and sensitivity) is much, much higher than the NanoDrop.\n\n\n\n\n21-APR-2023.

This is the beginning of my exploration of using GitHub to jot down thoughts, record ‘daily bits’, and organize the procedures and methods I’ll use in my thesis research\nzbengt introduced me to ‘elicit’, a lit review search AI. I searched “What is the role of endocrine signaling in cnidarian development” and found an exciting paper titled “Sea Anemones Responding to Sex Hormones, Oxybenzone, and Benzyl Butyl Phthalate: Transcriptional Profiling and in Silico Modelling Provide Clues to Decipher Endocrine Disruption in Cnidarians” authored by Morgan et al. in 2022\nI explored another AI, ChatGPT, and gave it the prompt “write me a poem about corals and oysters and mothers” and it returned:\n\n\nCoral reefs, a vibrant sea of life, A home for countless creatures, rife. Oysters, clams, and mussels too, All nestled safe, their shells in view.\nBut danger lurks, the waters warm, The coral bleaches, it’s colors torn. Mother Nature’s wrath, a sight to see, But we can help, if only we believe.\nFor mothers, fierce and loving beasts, Will do what it takes, to protect at least. Their young and home, with all their might, They’ll fight and strive, through day and night.\nSo let us join, in their noble quest, To save the reefs, and all the rest. For oysters, corals, and mothers too, Deserve a chance, to make it through.\n\n\nI followed up with a ChatGPT prompt “what are examples of endocrine signaling in cnidarians?” and it returned:\n\n\nEndocrine signaling is the process of communicating information from one cell to another by releasing hormones into the circulatory system or through direct contact. In cnidarians, endocrine signaling can be used for a variety of functions, including the regulation of growth, development, and behavior.\nOne example of endocrine signaling in cnidarians is the release of growth hormones, which stimulate the growth and development of cells and tissues. For example, in some species of cnidarians, the release of growth hormones is regulated by the action of a hormone called insulin-like growth factor (IGF).\nAnother example of endocrine signaling in cnidarians is the regulation of reproductive function. In some species of cnidarians, hormones called gonadotropins are released by the endocrine cells of the gonads (sex organs) to stimulate the production and release of gametes (sex cells).\nEndocrine signaling is also involved in the regulation of behavior in cnidarians. For example, some species of cnidarians release hormones called neuropeptides that act on the nervous system to regulate behaviors such as feeding, movement, and response to stimuli.\nOverall, endocrine signaling plays a vital role in the regulation of various functions in cnidarians, including growth, development, and behavior.\n\n\n\n​**Is this is all true!? I’ll have to follow-up with my own dive into primary literature…\n\nAnother ChatGPT AI response, when asked the same questions, but prompted to provide references:\n\n\nExamples of endocrine signaling in cnidarians include the release of hormones in response to stimuli such as touch, temperature changes, and changes in light intensity.\nFor example, the hormone adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (ACAP) is released from cnidocytes in response to a variety of stimuli and activates adenylate cyclase, leading to the production of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and the regulation of various physiological processes.\nOther signaling molecules that have been identified in cnidarians include cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), inositol triphosphate (IP3), and Ca2+-dependent signaling pathways.\nReferences:\nLevitan, D. R., & Kohn, A. B. (2001). The Endocrine System of Cnidarians. Annual Review of Physiology, 63(1), 319-344.\nSchmid, V., & Pfründner, R. (1995).

Acceptable tubes include Qubit® assay tubes (Invitrogen Cat. no. Q32856, 500 tubes) or Axygen PCR-05-C tubes(VWR, part number 10011-830).\n\nThe qubit tube should only be labelled on the top; the sides should be clear so that the qubit fluorescence can be read without impedance.\nThe intermediate tubes and qubit tubes can just be labelled with the cryo_id, and whether they are RNA or DNA products such as: 1Ea DNA or 2CHb RNA\nThe FINAL tubes should be labelled with cryo_id, DNA/RNA, extraction_id, date (ddMMMyy), & initials, such as:\n1Ea\nex1 SST\nRNA\n10APR23\n⚠️Important Notes! ⚠️\n\nUse ethanol-proof lab markers to label tubes (ethanol is added to the green spin away collection tube)\nLabel collection tubes, not filters!\nAlways wear lab gloves that have been sterilized before handling tubes!\nShake tubes out of their bags onto sterilized surface, don’t ‘reach in’ (this reduces potential contamination)\n\n\n\nPrepare Buffers\n\nIf using the 50-prep kit (D7003), add 96 ml 100% ethanol (104 ml 95% ethanol) to the 24 ml DNA/RNA Wash Buffer concentrate.​ If using the 10-prep kit, DNA/RNA Wash Buffer (D7003T) is supplied ready-to-use and does not require the addition of ethanol.\nReconstitute lyophilized DNase I with DNase/RNase-Free Water and mix by gentle inversion. Use immediately or store frozen aliquots.\n50-prep, add 275 µl water\n10-prep, add 55 µl water\n\nReconstitute lyophilized Proteinase K at 20 mg/ml with Proteinase K Storage Buffer and mix by vortexing. Use immediately or store frozen aliquots.\n50-prep, (60 mg), add 3.12 ml buffer\n10-prep, (5 mg), add 0.26 ml (260 ul) buffer\n\nTo prepare a 1X solution of DNA/RNA Shield™, add an equal volume (5mL for the whole solution) of nuclease-free water (not provided) to the DNA/RNA Shield™ (2X concentrate) (1:1) and mix with a quick pulse on the vortexer."

    "text": "Extraction Steps\n\nGrind/Homogenize: Mortar & Pestle Samples\n\nTake dry-ice cooler to -80 freezer, pull out frozen samples and place them in the dry-ice cooler. Work quickly and carefully to sort through the vials and select the ones that you are working with. Nest the selected sample vials in the dry ice, and return the rest back to the -80 freezer. Bring working samples on dry-ice back to the lab bench.\nDon cryo-gloves over nitrile gloves and ⚠️carefully⚠️ dispense a small amount (no more than 1L) of liquid nitrogen (LN2) into the transfer thermos. Everyone working with LN2 should have taken the Liquid Nitrogen Online Safety Course found HERE\nGrind each sample with mortar & pestle on LN2 -\n\n⚠️carefully⚠️ pour a small amount of LN2 into a sterilized mortar\nUsing sterilized forceps, pluck out coral fragments from the cryo vial and place in the mortar until you have as much material as about the size of an M&M (roughly a 16mm diameter sphere). Material amount does not have to be precise.\nPestle the coral fragment until it is ground to a powder. Work quickly to ensure the sample remains frozen. Add more LN2 when it evaporates from the mortar. This step is challenging! LN2 evaporates very quickly and must be replenished multiple times.\n\n\nThe coral is also very hard and prone to ‘squirting out’ from under the pestle\n\n\nLyse: Bead-Bash Samples\n\nUse sterilized scoopula to transfer the sample powder to its correspondingly labelled bead bashing tube\nAim to transfer 500uL of volume to each tube\nAdd 500uL of DNA/RNA Shield to each 2mL (0.1 - 0.5mm) bead-bashing tube with powdered sample and vortex to ensure powder is submersed in DNA/RNA Shield\nSet bead-bashing tubes in Mortexer and vortex at high speed for 40 minutes\n\n\n\nProteinase-K Digestion\n\nAfter bead bashing tubes are ‘intensely bubbly’\nTo tamp down bubbles, centrifuge in the mini-centrifuge for 1-2 minutes\nAdd Proteinase K & Buffer\n\nAdd the appropriate volume of Pro K buffer and Proteinase K (Proteinase K is stored in the -20 after being reconstituted)\n(10:1 ratio of sample:digestion buffer) & (2:1 ratio of digestion buffer:Proteinase K)\nFor tubes with 500uL of DNA/RNA Shield add:\n\n50ul pro k buffer\n25ul proteinase K\n\nIf you have tubes with a larger volume you can scale up the volumes (ex for 700ul, you would use 70ul buffer and 35ul pro k)\n\nIncubate in heat-block for 30mins at 55C\nVortex to mix\nCentrifuge on max for 30s\nTransfer \\(400 \\mu L\\) of the cleared supernatent to a nuclease-free tube\nAdd \\(400 \\mu L\\) of DNA/RNA Lysis Buffer to the supernatent(1:1) and vortex to mix\n\n\n\nPurify DNA & RNA\n\nTransfer the buffered supernatent (should be a total of 800uL, which can be passed through the filter in one go) to yellow Spin-Away Filter in a Collection Tube and centrifuge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDanger\n\n\n\nSave The flow-through in the collection tube for RNA purification! At this step the DNA is in the yellow spin column filter and the RNA is in the flow through.\n\n\n\nTranfser the yellow Spin-Away Filter to a new Collection Tube\nTo the RNA flow-through, add 800uL (1:1) of 200-proof ethanol to the flow-through and mix by pipetting up and down 12 times\nIn aliquots up to 700uL, transfer the RNA in ethanol to the green Zymo-Spin IIICG Column in a Collection Tube, centrifuge, and discard the flow-through. This step binds the RNA to the green column filter.\n\n\nDNase 1 Treatment\n\nAdd 400uL DNA/RNA Wash Buffer to the green Zymo-Spin IIICG Column, centrifuge and discard the flow-through\nTo prepare DNase 1 Reaction Mix: \\[\nDNase\\, 1\\, volume = 5 \\mu L * (no.\\, of\\, sample\\, preps)\n\\]\n\n\\[\nDNA\\, Digestion\\, Buffer\\, volume  = 75 \\mu L * (no.\\, of\\, sample\\, preps)\n\\]\n\nAdd 75uL of DNA Digestion Buffer per prep to a new nuclease-free tube\nAdd 5uL of reconstituted DNase 1 (thawed if previously frozen at \\(-20^{\\circ}C\\)) per sample prep to the nuclease-free tube\nMix by gentle inversion\n\n\nCarefully drip \\(80 \\mu L\\) of DNase 1 Reaction Mix directly onto the green Zymo-Spin IIICG Column filter and let incubate at room temperature for 15mins\nAdd \\(400 \\mu L\\) DNA/RNA Prep Buffer to each column and centrifuge at 16,000xg for 30s, then discard the flow-through\nAdd \\(700 \\mu L\\) of DNA/RNA Wash Buffer to each column and centrifuge at 16,000xg for 30s, then discard the flow-through\nAdd \\(400 \\mu L\\) of DNA/RNA Wash Buffer to each column and centrifuge at 16,000xg for 2mins to ensure complete removal of the wash buffer, then discard the flow-through\nCarefully transfer the column into the FINAL nuclease-free tube labelled for containing the eluted DNA/RNA end products\nAdd \\(50 \\mu L\\) DNase/RNase-Free Water directly to the column matrix and centrifuge at 16,000xg for 30s\nPlace FINAL eluted DNA/RNA tubes on ice\nTransfer \\(1 \\mu L\\) of each eluted DNA/RNA sample to their respectively labelled Qubit assay tube, and place Qubit assay tubes with eluted DNA/RNA on ice\nStore FINAL eluted DNA/RNA tubes in wax boxes in the \\(-80^{\\circ}C\\) freezer\nTake Qubit assay tubes to run Qubit quantification on eluted DNA and RNA\nEnd Products\n\nThe end products are two 1.5mL vials per sample that contain:\n\n50ul of DNA in nuclease-free water\n50ul of RNA in nuclease-free water.\n\nPlace these vials on ice and for RNA proceed with Qubit RNA Broad Range Protocol\nOR, to continue lab-work later,\nPlace them in a wax freezer box, label the box, and freeze them in the -80C."
