  abstract = {A high resolution coastal and ocean hydrodynamic model system was used to investigate the transport and deposition patterns of Particulate Organic Matter (POM) from kelp farmed at three locations of different properties: a sheltered location, an exposed location, and an offshore location. Published values on the sinking speeds of organic particles from kelp were used, spanning several orders of magnitude. Recent work on quantifying the release of particulate organic matter from farmed kelp was used to link the release of carbon to possible cultivation volumes and scenarios, and finally to link this to the potential for carbon loading on the ocean floor. The results are presented in terms of loading and distribution per unit harvested kelp, and the loading estimates are compared with estimates of natural (background) primary production. According to the simulation results, organic matter may be transported anything from a few (hundred) meters up to a hundred km away from the release site, depending on the sinking rates, time of release, and the location. The depth at which the matter settles on the sea floor likewise depends on the properties of the matter and the sites. The time until settlement varied from minutes to several hundred hours. The results underscore the importance of constraining the dispersal and deposition of detritus from kelp cultivation in order to better understand and quantify associated environmental risks posed by organic loading, and the potential for seafloor carbon sequestration by kelp farming as a nature based climate solution.},

  abstract = {Global habitat deterioration of marine ecosystems has led to a need for active interventions to halt or reverse the loss of ecological function. Restoration has historically been a key tool to reverse habitat loss and restore functions, but the extent to which this will be sufficient under future climates is uncertain. Emerging genetic technologies now provide the ability for restoration to proactively match adaptability of target species to predicted future environmental conditions, which opens up the possibility of boosting resistance to future stress in degraded and threatened habitats. As such, the choice of whether to restore to historical baselines or anticipate the future remains a key decision that will influence restoration success in the face of environmental and climate change. Here, we present an overview of the different motives for restoration \textendash{} to recover or revive lost or degraded habitats to extant or historical states, or to reinforce or redefine for future conditions. We focus on the genetic and adaptive choices that underpin each option and subsequent consequences for restoration success. These options span a range of possible trajectories, technological advances and societal acceptability, and represent a framework for progressing restoration of marine habitat forming species into the future.},

  abstract = {Rising atmospheric CO2 is expected to increase global temperatures and partial pressure of CO2 in surface waters, causing ocean warming and acidification. These changes may have important consequences for the physiological performance of early life-history stages of marine organisms. In this study we investigated the potential for interactive effects of ecologically relevant levels of temperature and pCO(2) on germination, dormancy and mortality of zoospores of the giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera, a foundation species of temperate reef ecosystems. Newly settled kelp spores were cultured in the laboratory for seven days in a factorial design with temperature (13 degrees C and 18 degrees C) and pCO(2) (similar to 370 and similar to 1800 mu atm) as experimental factors. The two levels of temperature and the low-pCO(2) treatment in our design were consistent with present-day environmental conditions in the kelp forest as measured by autonomous temperature and pH sensors, while the high-pCO(2) treatment reflects an extreme, future acidification scenario. Our results revealed that the combined effects of increased temperature and pCO(2) can significantly decrease germination rates and increase the mortality of kelp spores. Interactive effects of temperature and pCO(2) were detected,on spore mortality and dormancy. Spore mortality only differed between pCO(2) treatments at high temperature. In contrast, spore dormancy was higher in the treatment with low temperature and high pCO(2), which is similar to the environmental conditions experienced during upwelling events in southern California. Our results highlight the importance of considering multiple stressors to understand how the early-stages of foundation species such as M pyrifera will be affected by global change.

  abstract = {A growing trend of interest for the cultivation of kelp is driven by predictions for high global demands of important commodities, which require the development of alternative supplies of natural resources. In this study the dynamics of loss of biomass from cultivated               Saccharina latissima               were studied from February to August 2018 at two kelp farms in Northern (69\textdegree 45.26{${'}$}N/019\textdegree 02.18{${'}$}E) and in Mid-Norway (63\textdegree 42.28{${'}$}N/08\textdegree 52.23{${'}$}E). Kelp fronds at each farm were individually followed throughout the growing season. Sectional regression was applied for conversion of measured frond lengths to estimated dry weights. The study shows that between 40 and 100\% of all individuals in the studied kelp population constantly eroded slightly from their distal ends. However, until June the accumulated loss was only 8\% of produced dry weight. Due to dislodgement of whole sporophytes this picture changed in July and August to heavy losses in Mid-Norway. Thus, the overall losses of kelp in terms of accumulated dry weight were only 8\textendash 13\% of the gross growth until harvest in June in Mid-Norway and August in Northern Norway. Losses increased significantly in Mid-Norway during July and reached 49.4\% of the annual production in August. The rates of losses were separated into specific erosion and dislodgement rates. Erosion rates over the whole experimental period for the two sites were not significantly different, while differences in dislodgement rates between farm sites proved to be highly significant. The exported annual amount of carbon was estimated on the basis of lost and measured carbon content in the tissue. From these data a scenario was built for a commercial Norwegian kelp farm growing               S. latissima               showing a carbon export of 63\textendash 88 g C m               \textendash 2               y               \textendash 1               . This is eight times less than has been reported from scenarios for kelp farms in China. This study confirms that optimal timing of harvest is the most important management tool for avoidance of heavy losses from kelp farms. In conclusion, an industry with early harvest will likely have a low carbon export, while a late-harvested bulk production could export four to six times as much carbon with an increased potential for carbon sequestration.},

  abstract = {Global seaweed carbon sequestration estimates are currently taken as the fraction of the net primary production (NPP) exported to the deep ocean. However, this perspective does not account for CO2 from the consumption of external subsidies. Here, we clarify: (i) the role of export relative to seaweed net ecosystem production (NEP) for a closed system and one more likely open to subsidies; (ii) the importance of subsidies by compiling published estimates of NEP from seaweed-dominated ecosystems; and (iii) discuss their impact on the global seaweed net carbon balance and other sequestration constraints as a mitigation service. Examples of seaweed NEP (n~=~18) were sparse and variable. Nevertheless, the average NEP (-4.0~mmol C m\textendash 2 d\textendash 1 SE {$\pm~$}12.2) suggested that seaweed ecosystems are a C source, becoming increasingly heterotrophic as their export is consumed. Critically, mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions was mixed relative to their replacement or baseline states, and where CO2 is supplied independently of organic metabolism and atmospheric exchange, we caution a sole reliance on NEP or NPP. This will ensure a more accurate seaweed mitigation assessment, one that does exceed their capacity and is effective within a compliance and carbon trading scheme.},

Without this knowledge, health-based consumption advisories can not be determined for consumers that include Tribes and First Nations, Asian and Pacific Islander community members, and recreational harvesters. We measured contaminant concentrations in edible seaweeds (Fucus distichus, F. spiralis, and Nereocystis luetkeana) from 43 locations in the Salish Sea. Metals were analyzed in all samples, and 94 persistent organic pollutants (POPs) (i.e. 40 PCBs, 15 PBDEs, 17 PCDD/Fs, and 22 organochlorine pesticides) and 51 PAHs were analyzed in Fucus spp. We compared concentrations of contaminants to human health-based screening levels calculated from the USEPA and to international limits. We then worked with six focal contaminants that either exceeded screening levels or international limits (Cd, total Hg, Pb, benzo[a]pyrene [BaP], and PCBs) or are of regional interest (total As). USEPA cancer-based screening levels were exceeded in 30 samples for the PCBs and two samples for BaP. Cadmium concentrations did not exceed the USEPA noncancer-based screening level but did exceed international limits at all sites. Lead exceeded international limits at three sites. Because there are no screening levels for total Hg and total As, and to be conservative, we made comparisons to methyl Hg and inorganic As screening levels. All samples were below the methyl Hg and above the inorganic As screening levels. Without knowledge of the As speciation, we cannot assess the health risk associated with the As. While seaweed was the focus, we did not consider contaminant exposure from consuming other foods. Other chemicals, such as contaminants of emerging concern (e.g., PFAS, pharmaceuticals and personal care products), should also be considered. Additionally, although we focused on toxicological aspects, there are cultural and health benefits of seaweed use that may affect consumer choice.},

In comparison, IMTA systems excluding a fed component have received little research. Here we report a field study of an IMTA cultivation of the sugar kelp, Saccharina latissima, and the blue mussel, Mytilus edulis, on the Swedish west coast. Kelp were cultivated at two depths, 1-2~m and 3-4~m, either 10~m downstream of commercial scale blue mussel farms, or at control (monoculture) sites at least 500~m from the nearest farm. Significant enhancement of kelp yields in terms of both blade length and biomass was observed in IMTA treatments compared to monoculture, with a mean increase in length of 22\% and biomass of 38\%. Moreover, kelps co-cultivated with mussels displayed an epiphyte reduction of more than half compared to kelps grown in monoculture, with a 15\% coverage in monoculture compared to 6\% in co-culture. Significant increases in pigment content were also detected, with higher levels of chlorophyll a, fucoxanthin and phaeophytin in IMTA treatment kelps in comparison to monoculture. This study provides evidence for the potential of IMTA systems containing solely extractive species and presents factors beyond nutrient enrichment as drivers for enhanced growth in these systems.},

Whereas the basic physiological and ecophysiological characteristics of kelps are well studied, the molecular processes underlying acclimation to different light and temperature conditions are still poorly understood. Therefore we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the physiological acclimation to light and temperature stress. Sporophytes of S. latissima were exposed to combinations of light intensities and temperatures, and microarray hybridizations were performed to determine changes in gene expression patterns. This first large-scale transcriptomic study of a kelp species shows that S. latissima responds to temperature and light stress with a multitude of transcriptional changes: up to 32\% of genes showed an altered expression after the exposure experiments. High temperature had stronger effects on gene expression in S. latissima than low temperature, reflected by the higher number of temperature-responsive genes. We gained insights into underlying molecular processes of acclimation, which includes adjustment of the primary metabolism as well as induction of several ROS scavengers and a sophisticated regulation of Hsps. We show that S. latissima, as a cold adapted species, must make stronger efforts for acclimating to high than to low temperatures. The strongest response was caused by the combination of high temperatures with high light intensities, which proved most harmful for the alga.},

In kelps, the sexuality is expressed during the haploid life stage and the microscopic gametophytes exhibit significant sexual dimorphism. To understand the sex-dependent impact of temperature on the gametophyte stage, we analyzed for the first time, gene expression profiles of male and female gametophytes at three different temperatures (4, 12, and 20\textdegree C) characteristic for the species distribution range by using RNA-sequencing. We identified several differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between sexes; while female biased genes were enriched in general metabolism and energy production, male biased genes function within cell cycle and signaling. In our study, temperature modulated sex-biased gene expression, with only a small percentage of DEGs consistently male (7\%) or female-biased (12\%) at the three temperatures. Female gametophytes responded stronger to higher temperatures than males, suggesting that males are more heat tolerant. Differences between S. latissima and other brown algal gender-dependent gene expression might mirror the different evolutionary and ecological contexts. Genomic information on kelp gametophyte is still scarce and thus this study adds to our knowledge on sex differences in abiotic stress responses in macroalgae at the transcriptomic level.},

  abstract = {Thermal tolerance is often interpreted as a species-wide thermal niche in the absence of studies focusing on the adaptive potential of populations to exhibit differential thermal tolerance. Thus, considering intraspecific thermal plasticity, local adaptation or both between populations along distributional gradients~when interpreting and predicting species responses to warming is imperative. Removing the effect of environmental histories by raising kelp gametophyte generations               in vitro               under common garden conditions allows unbiased comparison between population-specific adaptive variation under different environmental conditions. Following this approach, this study aims to detect (potentially) adaptive differentiation in microscopic life-stages (gametophytes) between populations of a temperate forest forming kelp,               Laminaria ochroleuca               from locations with distinct thermal conditions. Gametophytes from four geographically distinct populations were subjected to different temperature treatments (17, marine heat waves of 23, 25 and 27\textdegree C) and gametophyte survival during thermal stress as well as reproductive success and photosynthetic responses during recovery were investigated. Intraspecific variation in resilience and reproductive output to thermal stress was found in               L. ochroleuca               ; gametophytes from the most northern population (Brittany, France) were the most thermally sensitive, with mortality onset at 23\textdegree C, whereas mortality in the remaining populations was only apparent at 27\textdegree C. Gametophytes from northern Spain and Morocco exhibited very low reproductive success during recovery from 23 and 25\textdegree C. However, when recovering from the highest thermal treatment (27\textdegree C) the reproductive development and sporophyte output was higher than in the gametophytes from France and Italy (Mediterranean). The population-specific responses of gametophyte resilience and reproductive success to temperature stress suggest genetic differentiation in response to variation in local thermal regimes.},

Here we review the literature on seaweed responses to MHWs, including 58 observations related to resistance, bleaching, changes in abundance, species invasions and local to regional extinctions. More records existed for canopy-forming kelps and bladed and filamentous turf-forming seaweeds than for canopy-forming fucoids, geniculate coralline turf and crustose coralline algae. Turf-forming seaweeds, especially invasive seaweeds, generally increased in abundance after a MHW, whereas native canopy-forming kelps and fucoids typically declined in abundance. We also found four examples of regional extinctions of kelp and fucoids following specific MHWs, events that likely have long term consequences for ecological structure and functioning. Although a relatively small number of studies have described impacts of MHWs on seaweed, the broad range of documented responses highlights the necessity of better baseline information regarding seaweed distributions and performance, and the need to study specific characteristics of MHWs that affect the vulnerability and resilience of seaweeds to these increasingly important climatic perturbations. A major challenge will be to disentangle impacts caused by the extreme temperature increases of MHWs itself from co-occurring potential stressors including altered current patterns, increasing herbivory, changes in water clarity and nutrient content, solar radiation and desiccation stress in the intertidal zone. With future increases anticipated in the intensity, duration and frequencies of MHWs, we expect to see more replacements of large long-lived habitat forming seaweeds with smaller ephemeral seaweeds, reducing the habitat structure and effective services seaweed-dominated reefs can provide.},

  abstract = {Kelp forests are economically important ecosystems that support a wealth of biodiversity but are declining globally. They are often replaced by biologically depauperate alternate stable states dominated by turfing algae. Hysteresis maintains algal turfs by inhibiting kelp recruitment, preventing the reestablishment of kelp forests. The mechanisms inhibiting kelp recruitment remain poorly understood as microscopic stages of kelp are difficult to study in situ. A potential mechanism contributing to the suppression of recruitment may be turf-facilitated grazing of kelp gametophytes, the haploid free-living reproductive life stage. Here we assess the resilience of kelp gametophytes to grazing pressure from a gastropod micrograzer commonly present in turf under current and future ocean warming scenarios. Gametophyte coverage and abundance were significantly reduced following grazing under all temperatures, however there was no significant effect of temperature on grazing rates. Once grazing pressure was removed, gametophyte abundance recovered to control levels, but the total coverage and length of gametophytes continued to decline in all treatments. Gametophytes were found to survive micrograzer ingestion and continued to grow in aggregations in the gastropod's mucus trail and faeces, even producing sporophytes. Gametophyte survival post-ingestion may positively contribute to dispersal and sporophyte recruitment, however the lack of gametophyte recovery at elevated temperatures may counteract this effect under future ocean warming. Taken together, this study demonstrates complex interactions that take place in the turf micro-habitat of kelp gametophytes and highlights biotic factors influencing transitions between kelp forests and algal turfs.},

  abstract = {Organelles are intracellular compartments which are themselves compartmentalized. Biogenic and metabolic processes are localized to specialized domains or microcompartments to enhance their efficiency and suppress deleterious side reactions. An example of intra-organellar compartmentalization is the pyrenoid in the chloroplasts of algae and hornworts. This microcompartment enhances the photosynthetic CO2-fixing activity of the Calvin-Benson cycle enzyme Rubisco, suppresses an energetically wasteful oxygenase activity of Rubisco, and mitigates limiting CO2 availability in aquatic environments. Hence, the pyrenoid is functionally analogous to the carboxysomes in cyanobacteria. However, a comprehensive analysis of pyrenoid functions based on its protein composition is lacking. Here we report a proteomic characterization of the pyrenoid in the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Pyrenoid-enriched fractions were analyzed by quantitative mass spectrometry. Contaminant proteins were identified by parallel analyses of pyrenoid-deficient mutants. This pyrenoid proteome contains 190 proteins, many of which function in processes that are known or proposed to occur in pyrenoids: e.g. the carbon concentrating mechanism, starch metabolism or RNA metabolism and translation. Using radioisotope pulse labeling experiments, we show that pyrenoid-associated ribosomes could be engaged in the localized synthesis of the large subunit of Rubisco. New pyrenoid functions are supported by proteins in tetrapyrrole and chlorophyll synthesis, carotenoid metabolism or amino acid metabolism. Hence, our results support the long-standing hypothesis that the pyrenoid is a hub for metabolism. The 81 proteins of unknown function reveal candidates for new participants in these processes. Our results provide biochemical evidence of pyrenoid functions and a resource for future research on pyrenoids and their use to enhance agricultural plant productivity.
