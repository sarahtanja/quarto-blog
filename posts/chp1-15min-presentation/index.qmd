`8 million tons` of plastics enter the oceans `every year`

::: {.notes}
Today I am going to talk about phthalates, thermal stress and the microbiome of Montipora capitata corals... and while this talk will get deep into the nitty-gritty weeds of genomics and physiology (don't worry, yes we will get there), I want to start by acknowledging that this research was motivated by the dual global challenges of marine plastic pollution and ocean warming.

Like this art piece by photographer Celine Bellanger on the coast of France depits, this is the monster we are fighting
