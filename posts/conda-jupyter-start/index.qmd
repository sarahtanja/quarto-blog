Sometimes it seems the hardest part about developing a new workflow is deciding *where* to put it! As I start working on analyzing my microbiome data, I need to have a workspace that has conda and can run QIIME2 in a jupyter notebook.

I started by following the [QIIME2 Install Instructions](https://docs.qiime2.org/2023.5/install/native/) for a native install on a Windows Subsystem for Linux.

SSH into the Roberts Lab raven server by:

```{r. engine='bash'}
ssh stanja@172.25.149.12
```
...and then enter the user password and press enter.

The following is the command to start the conda shell on the Roberts Lab raven server:

```{r, engine='bash'}
eval "$(/opt/anaconda/anaconda3/bin/conda shell.bash hook)"
```
