  abstract = {Seawater, sediment, seagrass and fish from several sites along the Tunisian coast were monitored for several phthalate esters (PAEs) and non-phthalate plasticizers (NPPs) during 2018\textendash 2019. In water and sediment, NPPs were higher than PAEs, being di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP, 0.0717 and 4.59 {$\mu$}g/g), and di(2-ethylhexyl) terephthalate (DEHT, 0.634 and 2.42 {$\mu$}g/g) most abundant. As expected, sediments acted as a sink for plasticizers, thus revealing a stronger contamination than water. Seagrass was less contaminated than fish, being DEHP (0.726 and 1.77 {$\mu$}g/g) and DEHT (9.19 and 23.2 {$\mu$}g/g) predominant. Biota poorly concentrated/accumulated plasticizers from water and sediment depending on the logKoct/wat and water solubility of single congeners. The spatial distribution of plasticizers was affected by the proximity to anthropogenic sources and the rate of coastal currents; whereas their seasonal variation may be related to the length of time of touristic/industrial inputs and factors such as rainfall and urban stormwater runoff.},

  abstract = {This study provides a first estimation on the sources, distribution and risk of organic micropollutants (OMPs) in coastal waters from NW Mediterranean Sea. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, polychlorinated biphenyls, organochlorinated pesticides, polybrominated diphenyl ethers, phthalates and alkylphenols were analyzed by solid phase extraction and gas chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (SPE\textendash GC\textendash EI-MS/MS). River waters and wastewater treatment plant effluents discharging to the sea were identified as the main sources of OMPs to coastal waters, with an estimated input amount of around of 25,800 g d-1. The concentration of {$\Sigma$}OMPs in coastal areas ranged from 17.4 to 8442 ng L-1, and was the highest in port waters, followed by coastal and river mouth seawaters. A summarized overview of the patterns and sources of OMP contamination on the investigated coastal sea waters of NW Mediterranean Sea, as well as of their geographical distribution was obtained by Principal Component Analysis of the complete data set after its adequate pretreatment. Alkylphenols, bisphenol A and phthalates were the main contributors to {$\Sigma$}OMPs and produced an estimated significant pollution risk for fish, algae and the sensitive mysid shrimp organisms in seawater samples. The combination of GC-MS/MS, chemometrics and risk analysis is proven to be useful for a better control and management of OMP discharges.},

  abstract = {Plastic pollution is a global threat to marine ecosystems. Plastic litter can leach a variety of substances into marine environments; however, virtually nothing is known regarding how this affects photosynthetic bacteria at the base of the marine food web. To address this, we investigated the effect of plastic leachate exposure on marine Prochlorococcus, widely considered the most abundant photosynthetic organism on Earth and vital contributors to global primary production and carbon cycling. Two strains of Prochlorococcus representing distinct ecotypes were exposed to leachate from common plastic items: high-density polyethylene bags and polyvinyl chloride matting. We show leachate exposure strongly impairs Prochlorococcus in vitro growth and photosynthetic capacity and results in genome-wide transcriptional changes. The strains showed distinct differences in the extent and timing of their response to each leachate. Consequently, plastic leachate exposure could influence marine Prochlorococcus community composition and potentially the broader composition and productivity of ocean phytoplankton communities., Sasha Tetu et al. have examined the effects of plastic leachate exposure on the marine bacteria Prochlorococcus, the most abundant photosynthetic organism on Earth. They find plastic leachates impair growth, photosynthetic capacity and cause global changes in transcription.},
