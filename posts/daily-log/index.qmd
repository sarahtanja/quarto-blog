```{r}
dilute <- function(C1, C2) {
  # Initialize variables
  n <- length(C1)
  C1 <- C1
  V1 <- numeric(n)  # Initialize V1 vector
  V2 <- numeric(n)  # Initialize V2 vector
  
  # Loop through rows
  for (i in seq_along(C1)) {
    # Check for missing data
    if (C1[i] <= 0) {
      cat("Skipping row ", i, ": Invalid data\n")
      next
    }
    
    # Initialize V1 and V2 for the current row
    V1_row <- 1
    V2_row <- (C1[i] * V1_row) / C2
    
    # Loop until conditions are satisfied
    while (!is.na(V1_row) && !is.na(V2_row) && (V1_row < 1 || V2_row < 50)) {
      V1_row <- V1_row + 1
      V2_row <- (C1[i] * V1_row) / C2
      
      # Break the loop if V1 exceeds a threshold value
      if(V1_row > 49) {
        cat("Skipping row ", i, ": No valid solution found\n")
        next
      }
    }
    
    # Store optimized V1 and V2 values in the corresponding vectors
    V1[i] <- V1_row
    V2[i] <- V2_row
  }
  
# Create a data frame with C1 column
  result <- data.frame(C1 = C1)

# Add V1 and V2 columns to the result data frame
  result$V1 <- V1
  result$V2 <- V2
  result$C2 <- C1*V1/V2

  return(result)
}

-   found [96-well PCR shipping guide](https://microbe.med.umich.edu/sites/default/files/downloads/2021_ConsolidatedShippingGuide_0.pdf)

-   emailed Mr.DNA about 20 16S samples

-   read up on NanoDrop vs. Qubit

-   reached out to Sam White about Ubuntu/Windows dual-boot computer in lab 236, which is connected to the Thermo NanoDrop 2000c Sam shared:

    > FYI, if you're solely using the NanoDrop for quantification (i.e. not worried about 260/280), then I'd highly recommend just relying on the Qubit, with both DNA and RNA. The reason for this is that the NanoDrop will almost always over-"calculate" your sample concentrations (both RNA and DNA). The reason for this is that the NanoDrop is a spectrophotometer and measures light absorbance. With almost all DNA/RNA isolations, there will be residual DNA or RNA in your sample. The NanoDrop cannot distinguish between the two molecules, because they're both made up of the same material; nucleotides. Nucleotides, regardless of their of their origin will absorb light at an average wavelength of 260nm.Since the Qubit assays use molecule-specific dyes, the dye will only bind to DNA or only to RNA. The dyes will not bind to any carryover of other types of molecules in the sample, so the accuracy (and sensitivity) is much, much higher than the NanoDrop.

##### 21-APR-2023. F

        -   https://github.com/AHuffmyer/EarlyLifeHistory_Energetics \> Here is the spreadsheet of my NCBI accession numbers for my sequences: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qDGGpLFcmoO-fIFOPSUhPcxi4ErXIq2PkQbxvCCzI40/edit?pli=1#gid=457642286 If you look at the Mcapitata Ontogeny Timeseries tab it'll have all the SRR numbers you will need to download the TagSeq files. Instead of downloading the full data set you could just pick like three lifestages for a test comparison - AH

##### 10-APR-2023. M

-   created script to randomize sample processing in [coral-DNA-RNA-lab-extractions](https://github.com/sarahtanja/coral-DNA-RNA-lab-extractions) repo

            > The University of Washington is transitioning from their old DOS-based system to Workday Finance, with a Go Live date of July 5th, 2023. During the transition period, there will be some disruptions to normal operations, and the continuity of research and teaching and minimizing the impact on faculty, staff, and students is the priority. There will be Restrictive Periods during which no one will be able to process purchase orders or obtain reimbursements in ARIBA. Exceptions may be made for urgent or emergency purchases. Travel reimbursements and non-travel-related reimbursements should be submitted before June 9th, and processing will resume on July 5th. Blanket Purchase Orders that are expected to be active past June 30th, 2023, will not be automatically transferred to Workday, and all continuing BPOs must be manually reentered by the College of the Environment. Navigating the transition will require patience and close partnerships between research and administrative groups

-   called Zymo tech Christian Camacho ccamacho\@zymoresearch.com to get advice on working with coral samples and the Zymo DNA/RNA miniprep kit:

    -   bead bash for 40 minutes for microbes on mortexer vortex-mixer! This is still tested to result in good RNA, though there may be a trade-off between bead-bashing for lysis and RNA interity... see Zymo optimized lysis protocol
    -   benchmark mortexer is not a tested method for the kit.. but it's closest to the vortex genie approved method for lysis
        -   [optimized lysis protocols](https://files.zymoresearch.com/documents/bead_beating_short_protocol_tables.pdf)
    -   mortar & pestle with liquid nitrogen, then add powder to bead bashing tube with RNA shield
    -   lyophilized (freeze-dried) proteinase K is stable at room temp, it should be stored in the -20 freezer only after resuspending in the buffer
    -   the DNAse 1 is similarly a lyophilized powder, but a very small amount, such that the vial looks empty

-   Gathered lab supplies

    -   mortar & pestles
    -   alcohol burner for use with denatured ethyl alcohol
    -   flint spark torch ignitor
    -   found expired RNA later
    -   DNAse away
    -   DEPC water (does that expire?)
    -   weigh papers (for powdered samples)

    NEED

        > Coral reefs, a vibrant sea of life, A home for countless creatures, rife. Oysters, clams, and mussels too, All nestled safe, their shells in view.
        >
        > But danger lurks, the waters warm, The coral bleaches, it's colors torn. Mother Nature's wrath, a sight to see, But we can help, if only we believe.
        >
        > For mothers, fierce and loving beasts, Will do what it takes, to protect at least. Their young and home, with all their might, They'll fight and strive, through day and night.
        >
        > So let us join, in their noble quest, To save the reefs, and all the rest. For oysters, corals, and mothers too, Deserve a chance, to make it through.

-   I followed up with a ChatGPT prompt "what are examples of endocrine signaling in cnidarians?" and it returned:

    -   

        > Endocrine signaling is the process of communicating information from one cell to another by releasing hormones into the circulatory system or through direct contact. In cnidarians, endocrine signaling can be used for a variety of functions, including the regulation of growth, development, and behavior.
        >
        > One example of endocrine signaling in cnidarians is the release of growth hormones, which stimulate the growth and development of cells and tissues. For example, in some species of cnidarians, the release of growth hormones is regulated by the action of a hormone called insulin-like growth factor (IGF).
        >
        > Another example of endocrine signaling in cnidarians is the regulation of reproductive function. In some species of cnidarians, hormones called gonadotropins are released by the endocrine cells of the gonads (sex organs) to stimulate the production and release of gametes (sex cells).
        >
        > Endocrine signaling is also involved in the regulation of behavior in cnidarians. For example, some species of cnidarians release hormones called neuropeptides that act on the nervous system to regulate behaviors such as feeding, movement, and response to stimuli.
        >
        > Overall, endocrine signaling plays a vital role in the regulation of various functions in cnidarians, including growth, development, and behavior.

â\*\*Is this is all true!? I'll have to follow-up with my own dive into primary literature...

-   Another ChatGPT AI response, when asked the same questions, but prompted to provide references:

    -   

        > Examples of endocrine signaling in cnidarians include the release of hormones in response to stimuli such as touch, temperature changes, and changes in light intensity.
        >
        > For example, the hormone adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (ACAP) is released from cnidocytes in response to a variety of stimuli and activates adenylate cyclase, leading to the production of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and the regulation of various physiological processes.
        >
        > Other signaling molecules that have been identified in cnidarians include cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), inositol triphosphate (IP3), and Ca2+-dependent signaling pathways.
