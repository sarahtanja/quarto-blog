## November 2023

#### 05-NOV-2023

-   Undoing large file commit on coral-pae-temp for \~2hrs ðŸ¤¬, tried to just undo the one commit, but couldn't get it to work. Had to execute `git reset â€“hard origin/main`

-   Added the following to the `git/hooks/pre-commit` file:

        #!/bin/bash

        echo "automatically ignoring large files"
        find . -size 5M | sed 's|^\./||g' >> .gitignore
        cat .gitignore | sort | uniq > .gitignore

        git diff --exit-code .gitignore
        exit_status=$?
        if [ $exit_status -eq 1 ]
        then
            set +e
            for i in `cat .gitignore`
            do
            set +e
                git rm --cached $i
            done

            git add .gitignore
            git commit .gitignore --no-verify -m"ignoring large files"

            echo "ignored new large files"
        fi

#### 01-NOV-2023

-   GSS Presentation Design Workshop with Tim Essington

    -   Presentations should have ONE THING they are communicating: 'Here's a nugget'

    -   One Word Theme

    -   One Sentence Summary

    -   Add motion to a few slides to break things up visually

    -   Use a blank slide and pause at a key pivot in your story

    -   build the slide iteratively when you have a complex figure

    -   story arc:

        -   ordinary world

        -   challenge

        -   series of actions to overcome challenge

        -   resolution

        -   new world

    -   'Lean into your 'buts'

    -   leave silence + space between story arcs

-   attended lab meeting via Zoom

"Total RNA was extracted using the Duet DNA/RNA Miniprep Plus Kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA, USA, Cat #D7003) with modifications to the manufacturer's sample preparation steps, as described here. Sterile clippers were used to remove an approximately 1-cm diameter region from the coral tissue. The tissue clipping was placed in 500Â Î¼L of DNA/RNA shield (Zymo Cat #R1100-50) with 0.5Â mm glass beads (Fisher Scientific Cat #15-340-152) and homogenized by vortexing for 1Â minute. The supernatant (450Â Î¼l) was transferred to a new tube and centrifuged at 9000Â rcf for 3Â min to remove any debris. The supernatant (300Â Î¼l) was mixed with 30Â Î¼l of Proteinase K (Zymo Cat #D3001-2-20) digestion buffer and 15Â Î¼l of Proteinase K in a new tube using a brief vortex step. Equal volume of Zymo lysis buffer (Zymo Cat #D7001-1-200) was added (345Â Î¼l) and extraction was completed as outlined in the manufacturer's protocol. RNA concentration was quantified using the Qubit RNA Broad Range kit (Invitrogen Cat #Q10211) and integrity was assayed with an Agilent TapeStation 4200 system and the RNA Integrity Number (RIN) values ranged from 7.0--8.9. RNA libraries were prepared using the Zymo-Seq RiboFree Total RNA Library Kit (Zymo Cat #R3000) according to the manufacturer's instructions, starting with 125Â ng of RNA as input. Prepared libraries were sent to Zymo Research Corporation for sequencing using the Illumina HiSeq for paired end sequencing (2Â Ã—Â 100Â base pairs \[bp\])." - Wong & Putnam 2022 [@wong2022]

#### 11-OCT-2023

-   Attended [ISB](https://isbscience.org/) workshop day 1

    -   Gibbons-Lab github repo: <https://github.com/Gibbons-Lab/isb_course_2023/tree/main>

    -   center log ratio transform abundance counts

    -   recommended papers:

        -   [**Microbiome differential abundance methods produce different results across 38 datasets**](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-28034-z)

        -   [**Beta diversity (or Ordination) analysis**](https://www.futurelearn.com/info/courses/exploring-the-landscape-of-antibiotic-resistance-in-microbiomes/0/steps/272960#:~:text=PCoA%20and%20NMDS%20methods%20take,to%20fit%20a%20normal%20distribution)"PCoA and NMDS methods take the distance matrix as an input and are sensitive to distance method used. The PCoA maximises the linear correlation between samples, wherein NMDS maximises the rank-order correlation between samples. Additionally, in case of NMDS, data is not required to fit a normal distribution." This link has some good visualizations: <https://www.davidzeleny.net/anadat-r/doku.php/en:pcoa_nmds>

        -   Why is the mean being used instead of the median or the modal? Bacteria distribution is not a normal distribution across populations.... This is a log ratio of (relative abundance/geometric mean). It's a common method for transforming compositional data. For sequencing data normalization does not mean making anything normally distributed but rather putting samples on the same scale... Here's a review on the topic: <https://www.nature.com/articles/s41522-020-00160-w>

#### 01-SEP-2023

-   crashed my bike and badly injured my hands... can't do lab work ðŸ˜­

-   met with UW mim_c Steven Salipantes

    -   I need to send him a sample list for a final quote, but should be \$2K for \~100-120 samples (cost of sequencing lane + reagents) .. averages to \~\$20/sample, much better than Mr. DNA \~\$85/sample, plus no shipping charges.

    -   bring all 100-120 samples together

    -   1.5mL microcentrifuge tubes

    -   50uL volume , 20ng/uL quantity concentration

-   submitted SICB abstract

-   submitted Kip's capstone proposal to Greg Jensen

#### 28-AUG-2023

-   Look into the [Margaret A. Davidson Graduate Fellowship](https://coast.noaa.gov/nerrs/research/davidson-fellowship.html)

-   Wrote abstract for [SICB](https://sicb.org/) , Seattle Jan 2-6 ... Deadline is Aug 29th!

-   Met with UW mim_c Kyle Asfahl

-   balanced Hall budget, have \~\$5K left to spend

-   Michael Shriever reset medusaFTIR and downloaded Nanodrop software to it

-   Take Jeremy's samples out of freezer to thaw at 4PM

#### 24-AUG-2023

-   Trial with 2 ambient samples of modified extraction protocol and RNA Clean & Concentrator. I did 2 samples because I had a kit that had 2 preps left over. Most of the time spent is in lab bench sterilizing, prepping, labelling, getting ice! Which takes literally a 30 minute hike across campus... But I started at 930AM and finished with Qubit in the FTR Roberts Lab by 4PM. With 2 samples! Extractions take ALL DAY.

#### 17-AUG-2023

-   Are we sure we want to try TriZol for RNA? It isn't a phenol-free kit like the Quick DNA/RNA Miniprep, and we have RNA, we just need to purify it. Tomorrow lets run all eluted RNA through RNA Clean & Concentrator, and check it on Nanodrop! LFG.

-   **THE BLANK HAD 'TOO LOW' DNA IN QUBIT!**

-   Organized extraction notes (handwritten) for extractions 1-8

-   Reserved 1 King Bed in Hotel Block for WSN

-   Applied for WSN Student Travel Grant

    > **How will attending the WSN meeting help you advance your career as a naturalist and/or scientist (75 words max)?**
    >
    > Attending WSN would be my first opportunity to share my Masters thesis with the scientific community. As an undergrad, I had a bad first conference experience where I was ridiculed for not having results in a methods poster. I hope to attend WSN because its reputation as a welcoming environment for early-career scientists is the kind of scientific community I wish to be a part of and perpetuate in my own career.
    >
    > **What are you working on to improve diversity, equity and inclusion in your community (75 words max)? (Examples may relate to personal identify, interest, experience, etc.)**
    >
    > I recently took part of the Identity, Belonging, and Inquiry in Science Program, and received special training to mentor students from diverse backgrounds. My mentee worked hard to complete research that she will present at the upcoming SACNAS conference, and I couldn't be more proud. The training gave me confidence to take on another mentee, this time a Capstone student. Mentorship is a key part of DEI efforts that I find extremely rewarding.

#### 16-AUG-2023

-   asked JPG to buy benchtop UV Sterilizer for me & Callum, got approval! Purchased by Kat same day :D

-   NMDS (non-metric multidimensional scaling) ordination plots

-   walked with Callum, plan to ask JPG to buy Qubit too!

-   Made some taxonomy bar plots and heatmap dendrograms... still working to understand what they mean but they don't look like there is separation between treatments. Haven't gotten any pvalues yet from the composition analyses...

-   Wondering if I should break up the Notebook into diversity & composition? It's getting really long and overwhelming with all the analyses moshed together

-   Still can't `quarto render` in Jupyter Lab on raven server, need to figure out how to get those interactive jupyter plots in my notebook!

#### 15-AUG-2023

-   met with Dr. Amy VanCise about microbiome analysis:

    -   Look into work by WHOI Amy Apprill, Laura Weber, Cynthia Becker

    -   Focus analysis on **community composition** over **diversity** statistics

        > different sampling depths across different samples ... subsample the counts without replacement so that each sample has the same number of features

    -   Differential abundance analysis on microbial community is similar to differential gene expression analysis!

    -   Sampling depth is normalizing between samples

    -   Look into getting a UV Sterilizer

    -   Do the analysis without blank, mock, & env samples included... get a clean look at only treatments

    -   Look into R Vegan package

    -   Phred score: spatial, 30 (or 25) is good to keep

#### 03-AUG-2023

-   Received RNA samples back from UT GSAF

-   Used PCR Inhibitor Removal Kit on five of the samples (see RNA Woes post [here](https://sarahtanja.github.io/quarto-blog/posts/rna-woes/#:~:text=A260%20value.%E2%80%9D-,Zymo%20OneStep%20PCR%20Inhibitor%20Removal%20Kit,-I%20first%20tried)) :

    -   1-CA2a

    -   1-CH2a

    -   1-Ea

    -   1-PA2a

    -   1-PH1a

-   PCR Inhibitor Removal Kit said to add 50-200uL of RNA, but I only could add 30uL. I took the 5 samples from the 96-well plate and augmented them with all the leftover diluted normalized RNA.

-   Nanodrop note: blank should result in a spectrum that varies no more than 0.050A in the 1mm path. For this batch I used the Roberts Lab Nanodrop and the blank was -0.009/-0.008 10mm path.

## June 2023

#### 07-JUN-2023

-   Shipped DNA to Mr. DNA and RNA to UT GSAF!

#### 06-JUN-2023

-   Normalized all 20 RNA samples

#### 05-JUN-2023

-   Re-normalized 2-CA2a DNA and successfully got it to 19.5, 19.2 :D

-   Worked all day to normalize RNA with mixed results. In the first batch, 7 out of 20 samples were 'off' of the target concentration of 25ng/uL by enough to make me want to redo them (one was way high at 230ng/uL, others were too low at \~10ng/uL)

-   I first re-ran the qubit (2nd qubit run) and got really poor results, with all the rerun samples too-low, (even the one that was previously 230ng/uL!?)

-   I then re-normalized the samples and ran them on qubit again (3rd qubit run). In this run 4-PH1b hit the target, the rest were still too low

-   I re-normalized the samples for a third time (with some increasing concentration modifications) and ran them on qubit for a 4th time. In this run 4-PA2a hit the target, the rest were still too low, and 2-PH2a even got worse despite increasing concentration.

-   Ended the day unsatisfied with the following samples too low for normalization despite 4 attempts:

    -   2-PH2a - too low

    -   2-CA2a - 15.0, 15.4

    -   1-PA2a - 10.2, 10.0

    -   1-PH1a - 17.6, 17.6

    -   3-CH2a - 15.0, 14.6

    -   4-CA1a - 14.0, 13.0

#### 02-JUN-2023

-   Normalized DNA (still have RNA left to do)
-   Tested normalized DNA on Qubit BR DNA assay, results overall were good but a smidge lower than my goal
-   blank + microbial standard extraction

#### 01-JUN-2023

-   Presented Bioinformatics [final project for FISH 546](https://rpubs.com/sarah_tanja/1048844)
-   Attended GSR Meeting
-   Attended Seminar/TGIT

## May 2023

#### 31-MAY-2023

-   wrote `dilute` function to normalize RNA & DNA in [coral-DNA-RNA-lab-extractions](https://github.com/sarahtanja/coral-DNA-RNA-lab-extractions/blob/main/code/03-normalizing.qmd) GitHub repo:

```{r}
dilute <- function(C1, C2) {
  # Initialize variables
  n <- length(C1)
  C1 <- C1
  V1 <- numeric(n)  # Initialize V1 vector
  V2 <- numeric(n)  # Initialize V2 vector
  
  # Loop through rows
  for (i in seq_along(C1)) {
    # Check for missing data
    if (C1[i] <= 0) {
      cat("Skipping row ", i, ": Invalid data\n")
      next
    }
    
    # Initialize V1 and V2 for the current row
    V1_row <- 1
    V2_row <- (C1[i] * V1_row) / C2
    
    # Loop until conditions are satisfied
    while (!is.na(V1_row) && !is.na(V2_row) && (V1_row < 1 || V2_row < 50)) {
      V1_row <- V1_row + 1
      V2_row <- (C1[i] * V1_row) / C2
      
      # Break the loop if V1 exceeds a threshold value
      if(V1_row > 49) {
        cat("Skipping row ", i, ": No valid solution found\n")
        next
      }
    }
    
    # Store optimized V1 and V2 values in the corresponding vectors
    V1[i] <- V1_row
    V2[i] <- V2_row
  }
  
# Create a data frame with C1 column
  result <- data.frame(C1 = C1)

# Add V1 and V2 columns to the result data frame
  result$V1 <- V1
  result$V2 <- V2
  result$C2 <- C1*V1/V2

  return(result)
}
```

#### 23-MAY-2023

-   completed UW driver safety training
-   met with Steven Roberts, confirmed that no blank/standard is used for RNA-seq
-   emailed with Jesse Zaneveld, learned about Zymo mock [microbial community standard](https://www.zymoresearch.com/collections/zymobiomics-microbial-community-standards/products/zymobiomics-microbial-community-standard) and [microbial community DNA standards](https://www.zymoresearch.com/collections/zymobiomics-microbial-community-standards/products/zymobiomics-microbial-community-dna-standard) to be used as positive controls for the extraction (community standard cells) and the PCR library prep and sequencing (community standard DNA) to assess bias in each process.
-   Put both Zymo standards on purcahsing log, emailed Kat and she said she would buy them tonight with the pcard
-   Met with Nora, she has made an [awesome quarto blog](https://norahess.quarto.pub/uw-lab-note-book/) for the IBIS celebration to showcase what she has learned. We also talked a bit about stats and need to follow up with what to do when your data is not normally distributed (moving from paired T test to Wilcoxon paired-sample T test)
-   Tried using `quarto publish gh-pages` command to publish blog

#### 19-MAY-2023

-   emailed Mr.DNA about 20 16S samples

-   read up on NanoDrop vs. Qubit

-   reached out to Sam White about Ubuntu/Windows dual-boot computer in lab 236, which is connected to the Thermo NanoDrop 2000c Sam shared:

    > FYI, if you're solely using the NanoDrop for quantification (i.e. not worried about 260/280), then I'd highly recommend just relying on the Qubit, with both DNA and RNA. The reason for this is that the NanoDrop will almost always over-"calculate" your sample concentrations (both RNA and DNA). The reason for this is that the NanoDrop is a spectrophotometer and measures light absorbance. With almost all DNA/RNA isolations, there will be residual DNA or RNA in your sample. The NanoDrop cannot distinguish between the two molecules, because they're both made up of the same material; nucleotides. Nucleotides, regardless of their of their origin will absorb light at an average wavelength of 260nm.Since the Qubit assays use molecule-specific dyes, the dye will only bind to DNA or only to RNA. The dyes will not bind to any carryover of other types of molecules in the sample, so the accuracy (and sensitivity) is much, much higher than the NanoDrop.

        -   no purchases in June!

            > The University of Washington is transitioning from their old DOS-based system to Workday Finance, with a Go Live date of July 5th, 2023. During the transition period, there will be some disruptions to normal operations, and the continuity of research and teaching and minimizing the impact on faculty, staff, and students is the priority. There will be Restrictive Periods during which no one will be able to process purchase orders or obtain reimbursements in ARIBA. Exceptions may be made for urgent or emergency purchases. Travel reimbursements and non-travel-related reimbursements should be submitted before June 9th, and processing will resume on July 5th. Blanket Purchase Orders that are expected to be active past June 30th, 2023, will not be automatically transferred to Workday, and all continuing BPOs must be manually reentered by the College of the Environment. Navigating the transition will require patience and close partnerships between research and administrative groups

-   called Zymo tech Christian Camacho ccamacho\@zymoresearch.com to get advice on working with coral samples and the Zymo DNA/RNA miniprep kit:

    -   bead bash for 40 minutes for microbes on mortexer vortex-mixer! This is still tested to result in good RNA, though there may be a trade-off between bead-bashing for lysis and RNA interity... see Zymo optimized lysis protocol

    -   benchmark mortexer is not a tested method for the kit.. but it's closest to the vortex genie approved method for lysis

        -   [optimized lysis protocols](https://files.zymoresearch.com/documents/bead_beating_short_protocol_tables.pdf)

    -   mortar & pestle with liquid nitrogen, then add powder to bead bashing tube with RNA shield

    -   lyophilized (freeze-dried) proteinase K is stable at room temp, it should be stored in the -20 freezer only after resuspending in the buffer

    -   the DNAse 1 is similarly a lyophilized powder, but a very small amount, such that the vial looks empty

-   Gathered lab supplies

    -   mortar & pestles
    -   alcohol burner for use with denatured ethyl alcohol
    -   flint spark torch ignitor

#### 09-JAN-2023

-   Today I setup my GitHub 'notebook'! This is the beginning of my exploration of using GitHub to jot down thoughts, record 'daily bits', and organize the procedures and methods I'll use in my thesis research

-   [zbengt](https://github.com/zbengt) introduced me to '[elicit](https://elicit.org/)', a lit review search AI. I searched "What is the role of endocrine signaling in cnidarian development" and found an exciting paper titled [**"Sea Anemones Responding to Sex Hormones, Oxybenzone, and Benzyl Butyl Phthalate: Transcriptional Profiling and *in Silico* Modelling Provide Clues to Decipher Endocrine Disruption in Cnidarians"**](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fgene.2021.793306/full) authored by Morgan et al. in 2022

-   I explored another AI, [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/), and gave it the prompt "write me a poem about corals and oysters and mothers" and it returned:

    -   

        > Coral reefs, a vibrant sea of life, A home for countless creatures, rife. Oysters, clams, and mussels too, All nestled safe, their shells in view.
        >
        > But danger lurks, the waters warm, The coral bleaches, it's colors torn. Mother Nature's wrath, a sight to see, But we can help, if only we believe.
        >
        > For mothers, fierce and loving beasts, Will do what it takes, to protect at least. Their young and home, with all their might, They'll fight and strive, through day and night.
        >
        > So let us join, in their noble quest, To save the reefs, and all the rest. For oysters, corals, and mothers too, Deserve a chance, to make it through.

-   I followed up with a ChatGPT prompt "what are examples of endocrine signaling in cnidarians?" and it returned:

    -   

        > Endocrine signaling is the process of communicating information from one cell to another by releasing hormones into the circulatory system or through direct contact. In cnidarians, endocrine signaling can be used for a variety of functions, including the regulation of growth, development, and behavior.
        >
        > One example of endocrine signaling in cnidarians is the release of growth hormones, which stimulate the growth and development of cells and tissues. For example, in some species of cnidarians, the release of growth hormones is regulated by the action of a hormone called insulin-like growth factor (IGF).
        >
        > Another example of endocrine signaling in cnidarians is the regulation of reproductive function. In some species of cnidarians, hormones called gonadotropins are released by the endocrine cells of the gonads (sex organs) to stimulate the production and release of gametes (sex cells).
        >
        > Endocrine signaling is also involved in the regulation of behavior in cnidarians. For example, some species of cnidarians release hormones called neuropeptides that act on the nervous system to regulate behaviors such as feeding, movement, and response to stimuli.
        >
        > Overall, endocrine signaling plays a vital role in the regulation of various functions in cnidarians, including growth, development, and behavior.

â€‹\*\*Is this is all true!? I'll have to follow-up with my own dive into primary literature...

-   Another ChatGPT AI response, when asked the same questions, but prompted to provide references:

    -   

        > Examples of endocrine signaling in cnidarians include the release of hormones in response to stimuli such as touch, temperature changes, and changes in light intensity.
        >
        > For example, the hormone adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (ACAP) is released from cnidocytes in response to a variety of stimuli and activates adenylate cyclase, leading to the production of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and the regulation of various physiological processes.
        >
        > Other signaling molecules that have been identified in cnidarians include cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), inositol triphosphate (IP3), and Ca2+-dependent signaling pathways.
        >
        > References:
