The aim of this protocol is to take coral fragments that have been snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and extract both DNA for downstream archaea & bacteria microbiome 16S Microbiome Sequencing and RNA for downstream coral-host tissue Tag-seq or RNA-seq analysis.

> In plain, I want to answer 'who is there?' regarding the bacterial community, and 'what is the coral doing?' regarding gene expression.

The benefits of doing DNA and RNA extraction together are that it saves time, money, & sample material. It also facilitates paired sample analysis, where each data point in one dataset is uniquely paired to a data point in the second dataset because we are making duplicate measurements on the *same sample*.

The challenge is lysing the sample enough to get the bacterial DNA (busting open all those layers of cell membranes!) and retaining host (coral) RNA integrity.

This protocol follows the Zymo Research [*Quick*-DNA/RNA Mininprep Plus Kit Instruction Manual](https://files.zymoresearch.com/protocols/_d7003t_d7003_quick-dna-rna_miniprep_plus_kit.pdf) with help and optimization from URI Putnam Lab Members Open Lab Notebook posts; such as Emma Strand's notebook post on [Zymo-Duet-RNA-DNA-Extraction-Protocol](https://emmastrand.github.io/EmmaStrand_Notebook/Zymo-Duet-RNA-DNA-Extraction-Protocol/), Kevin Wong's post on [Porites Extractions](https://kevinhwong1.github.io/KevinHWong_Notebook/20201027-DNA-RNA-Extractions-Porites-July-Bleaching-Experiment) and M.E. Schedl's post on [Porites Extractions](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/porites-zymo-rna/), as well as suggestions from a Zymo tech on [March 28th 2023](https://sarahtanja.github.io/lab-book/blog/daily-log/#28-mar-2023-t) regarding [optimized lysis protocols](https://files.zymoresearch.com/documents/bead_beating_short_protocol_tables.pdf) and suggestions from a Zymo tech on May 15th 2023 regarding optimized Proteinase K digestion temperature. This protocol was updated again in August 2023 after initial RNA samples failed library prep[^1] and DNA sample analysis showed high contamination present in the blank.

## Advanced Prep

### Biological Sample Info

The samples I am working with are liquid-nitrogen snap-frozen \~3cm *Montipora capitata* coral fragments held at -80°C, in 1.5mL cryovials. The samples are fragments of coral that had been exposed to the multiple stressors of thermal stress and phthalate pollution in 20mL mesocosms for 48 hours.

#### *Reagents*

::: column-margin
I previously used [DEPC-treated](https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/4387937#:~:text=DEPC%2Dtreated%20water%20is%20autoclaved,%2C%20exonuclease%2C%20and%20RNase%20activity.) water to dilute the 2X concentrated DNA/RNA Sheild, thinking this was the same thing as nuclease-free water. It Isn't! and this may have been a source of contamination in my initial blank microbiome sample!
:::

::: {.callout-important appearance="simple"}
The nuclease-free water is used to dilute 2X concentrated DNA/RNA Shield. It is very important for microbiome studies that this water does not have any bacterial contamination!

> "...extraction kits have a good amount of background (as does every reagent including the water you used... about the only reagent that does not have some background is the qiagen DNA free water... the 16s is extremely sensitive and a water extraction is VERY pure DNA so amplifies very well." - Advice via email from Dr. Scot Dowd, [Mr DNA Lab](https://www.mrdnalab.com/)
:::

-   [ ] [Qiagen nuclease-free water](https://www.qiagen.com/us/products/discovery-and-translational-research/lab-essentials/buffers-reagents/nuclease-free-water)
-   [ ] 99.5% (200 proof) molecular-grade ethanol

#### *Sterilizing*

-   [ ] 10% bleach in spray-bottle
-   [ ] 70% ethanol in spray-bottle
-   [ ] DI water in spray-bottle
-   [ ] RNase away in spray-bottle
-   [ ] Kimwipes/paper towels

#### *Pipettes & Tips*

-   [ ] P10 + filtered tips *DNase/RNase free*
-   [ ] P100 + filtered tips *DNase/RNase free*
-   [ ] P1000 + filtered tips *DNase/RNase free*
-   [ ] P5000 + tips (for buffer prep)

### Randomize Sample Processing

Make sure to randomize which samples are processed in each batch of extractions to reduce 'batch effects'!

::: column-margin
See ['Randomize Sample Processing'](https://github.com/sarahtanja/coral-DNA-RNA-lab-extractions/blob/main/rand-sample-processing.Rmd) script for how I randomized sample processing.
:::

::: {.callout-tip appearance="simple"}
Think about how many samples you can process at once, and your kit, centrifuge, and homogenizer capacity. You should also make sure to include a blank and a mock community for downstream analysis. 1 blank and 1 mock community extraction per analysis will suffice for a study like this one, which is focusing on the differences between treatments (and not focusing on the absolute numbers of bacteria in the samples)
:::

## Lab Setup

### Sterilize {#sterilize}

-   Don lab coat 🥼 & tie hair back , glove up 🧤

-   Spray down `benchtop`, `microcentrifuge tube racks`, `pipettes`, and `pipette tip boxes` with:

    -   `10% bleach` in spray-bottle, then wipe with Kimwipe

    -   `DI water` in spray-bottle, then wipe with Kimwipe

    -   `70% ethanol`in spray-bottle, then wipe with Kimwipe

-   Spray down `mortars & pestles` , `scoopulas`, and `forceps` with:

    -   `10% bleach` in spray-bottle, then wipe with Kimwipe

    -   `DI water` in spray-bottle, then wipe with Kimwipe

    -   `70% ethanol` in spray-bottle, then wipe with Kimwipe

    -   `RNase away` in spray-bottle, then wipe with Kimwipe

-   Spray Kimwipe with `RNase away` and wipe down equipment buttons/handles/surfaces that may have been touched by ungloved hands

-   Spray `RNase away`on gloves and rub hands together

### Arrange Lab Bench + Tubes

**Lysing Station**

-   liquid nitrogen dewer
-   dry-ice bucket with ❄️samples, ❄️scoopulas, & ❄️mini funnels[^4]
-   forceps
-   mortars & pestles
-   mortexer

[^4]: Placing the scoopulas and mini funnels on dry ice gets them cold to the same temperature as the powdered coral samples after grinding them in the mortar. This allows you to scoop the powder and have it remain cold❄️ while you transfer it as a cold dry powder through the funnel into the bead-bashing tube. If the scoopula and funnel are room temperature, when they touch the cold powdered sample they condensate and the sample gets wet and booger-like in consistency, making it impossible to transfer into the bead-bashing tube.

**Purification Station**

-   centrifuge
-   microcentrifuge tube racks
-   pipettes
-   pipette tips

I tend to arrange my workflow left to right:

### Prepare Buffers

-   [ ] If using the 50-prep kit (D7003), add `96 ml 100% ethanol (104 ml 95% ethanol)` to the 24 ml DNA/RNA Wash Buffer concentrate.

    ​ *If using the 10-prep kit, DNA/RNA Wash Buffer (D7003T) is supplied ready-to-use and does not require the addition of ethanol.*

-   [ ] Reconstitute `lyophilized DNase I` with `DNase/RNase-Free Water` and mix by gentle inversion. Use immediately or store frozen aliquots.

    -   [ ] 50-prep, add 275 µl water
    -   [ ] 10-prep, add 55 µl water

-   [ ] Reconstitute `lyophilized Proteinase K` at 20 mg/ml with `Proteinase K Storage Buffer` and mix by vortexing. Use immediately or store frozen aliquots.

    -   [ ] 50-prep, (60 mg), add 3.12 ml buffer
    -   [ ] 10-prep, (5 mg), add 0.26 ml (260 ul) buffer

-   [ ] To prepare a 1X solution of `DNA/RNA Shield™`, add an equal volume (5mL for the whole solution) of `nuclease-free water` (not provided) to the `DNA/RNA Shield™` (2X concentrate) (1:1) and mix with a quick pulse on the vortexer.

## Extraction Steps

### Grind/Homogenize: Mortar & Pestle Samples

-   Take [dry-ice](#dry-ice) cooler to the -80 freezer, pull out frozen samples and place them in the dry-ice cooler. Work quickly and carefully to sort through the vials and select the ones that you are working with. Nest the selected sample vials in the dry ice, and return the rest back to the -80 freezer. Bring working samples on dry-ice back to the lab bench.

    ::: {.callout-important appearance="simple"}
    Place the ❄️scoopulas❄️ and ❄️mini funnels❄️ in the dry ice 🧊 bucket!
    :::

-   Don cryo-gloves over nitrile gloves and ⚠️carefully⚠️ dispense a small amount of liquid nitrogen (LN2) into the transfer thermos. **Everyone working with LN2 should have taken the Liquid Nitrogen Online Safety Course found [HERE](https://www.ehs.washington.edu/training/liquid-nitrogen-safety)**

-   Grind each sample with mortar & pestle on LN2 -

    -   ⚠️carefully⚠️ pour a small amount of LN2 into a [sterilized](#sterilize) mortar
    -   Using [sterilized](#sterilize) forceps, pluck out coral fragments from the cryo vial and place in the mortar until you have about as much material as a lima bean. Material amount does not have to be precise.
    -   Pestle the coral fragment until it is ground to a powder[^5]. Work quickly to ensure the sample remains frozen. Add more LN2 when it evaporates from the mortar. This step is challenging! LN2 evaporates very quickly and must be replenished multiple times.

[^5]: The coral fragments are prone to 'squirting out' from under the pestle. Don't lose sample material! Rather than use your arms to 'stir' the fragments in a circular motion, crush the fragments by firmly placing the pestle square atop a fragment and press your whole torso body-weight onto the pestle. Think like a hydraulic press!

### Lyse: Bead-Bash Samples

-   Add 500uL of `DNA/RNA Shield` to each 2mL (0.1 - 0.5mm) bead-bashing tube

::: column-margin
In initial extractions I only used 500uL of DNA/RNA Sheild and was advised to increase it to at least 800uL by a Zymo rep:

> "A minimum of 800 µl of liquid volume is what we typically recommend when working with the BashingBead Tubes. This is because anything lower may lead to inefficient bead movement during shaking, oversaturation of content, and difficulties when transferring sample from the tube without disturbing the debris. All of these can lead to impurity by precipitation/clogging in the columns, therefore we highly recommend increasing the amount of DNA/RNA Shield for processing."
:::

-   Use chilled, [sterilized](#sterilize) scoopula and a sterilized chilled mini-funnel to transfer the sample powder to its correspondingly labelled [bead bashing tube](https://www.zymoresearch.com/collections/lysis-tubes/products/zr-bashingbead-lysis-tubes-0-1-0-5-mm)

-   Aim to transfer 500uL of powdered volume (take up about 1/4th of the 2mL tube, or an equal volume as the beads)

-   Cap the bead-bashing tube and shake it like a Polaroid picture

-   Open the tube, and 'top-off' the sample with another 1000uL of `DNA/RNA Shield`, bringing the total volume to 1500uL

-   Vortex to ensure powder is fully submersed in `DNA/RNA Shield`

-   Set bead-bashing tubes in Mortexer and homogenize at high speed for **40 minutes**

### Proteinase-K Digestion

-   Get the Proteinase K out of the -20 freezer & set the heat-block to warm up to 55C for 30mins

-   After bead bashing, tubes are ['intensely bubbly'](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/Larvae-Ex-Protocol/#:~:text=Tubes%20after%20vortexing%20are%20intensely%20bubbly), to tamp down bubbles, centrifuge in the mini-centrifuge for 1min

-   Transfer 600uL of supernatent to a new nuclease-free tube, making sure not to disturb beads and debris at the bottom of the bead-bashing tube[^6]

-   Add Proteinase K & Buffer

    -   Add the appropriate volume of Pro K buffer and Proteinase K (Proteinase K is stored in the -20 after being reconstituted)

    -   (10:1 ratio of sample:digestion buffer) & (2:1 ratio of digestion buffer:Proteinase K)

    -   For tubes with approximately 500uL of sample add:

        -   50ul pro K buffer
        -   25ul proteinase K

-   Vortex to mix

-   Incubate in the heat-block for 30mins at 55C

-   Vortex to mix & centrifuge on max for 2mins to pellet any debris

-   Transfer 350uL of the cleared supernatent to a new 1.5mL nuclease-free tube, making sure not to disturb any debris at the bottom of the tube

-   Add 350uL of **DNA/RNA Lysis Buffer** to the supernatent(1:1) and vortex to mix

[^6]: Why do we transfer from the bead-bashing tube to two different nuclease-free tubes in this step? Jerry Yu from Zymo says:

    > "We are worried about the sample debris remaining in the tube, which should still contain protein. One of the reasons for Proteinase K treatment at this step is to break down protein in the solution to make it less viscous/sticky, so the column can process it without issue. By transferring the mixture out, the treatment could be more efficient."

## Purify DNA & RNA

Transfer the buffered supernatent (should be a total of 700uL, which can be passed through the filter in one go) to yellow **`Spin-Away Filter`** in a **`Collection Tube`** and centrifuge at 16,000xg for 30 sec

::: {.callout-warning appearance="simple"}
Save The flow-through in the collection tube for RNA purification! At this step the DNA is in the yellow spin column filter and the RNA is in the flow through.
:::

Transfer the yellow **`Spin-Away Filter`** to a new **`Collection Tube`**

-   To the RNA flow-through, add 700uL (1:1) of 200-proof ethanol to the flow-through and mix by pipetting up and down 12 times

-   The RNA+ethanol volume is now 1,400uL. In aliquots up to 700uL, transfer the RNA sample to the green **`Zymo-Spin IIICG Column`** in a **`Collection Tube`**, centrifuge, and discard the flow-through. Dab the rim of the collection tube with a Kim Wipe to clean off any residual flow-through. This step binds the RNA to the green column filter. Repeat until all RNA Sample has passed through the filter.

> #### DNase 1 Treatment for RNA
>
> -   Add 400uL **`DNA/RNA Wash Buffer`** to the `green Zymo-Spin IIICG Column`, centrifuge and discard the flow-through
>
> -   For each sample to be treated, prepare **`DNase 1 Reaction Mix`**: $$
>     DNase\, 1\, volume = 5 \mu L * (no.\, of\, sample\, preps)
>     $$ $$
>     DNA\, Digestion\, Buffer\, volume  = 75 \mu L * (no.\, of\, sample\, preps)
>     $$
>
> -   Add 75uL of **`DNA Digestion Buffer`** per prep to a new nuclease-free tube
>
> -   Add 5uL of reconstituted **`DNase 1`** (thawed if previously frozen at -20C) per sample prep to the nuclease-free tube
>
> -   Mix by gentle inversion
>
> -   Carefully drip 80uL of **`DNase 1 Reaction Mix`** directly onto the `green Zymo-Spin IIICG Column` filter and let incubate at room temperature for **15mins**

### Wash & Elute

-   Add 400uL **`DNA/RNA Prep Buffer`** to each column and centrifuge at 16,000xg for 30s, then discard the flow-through

-   Add 700uL of **`DNA/RNA Wash Buffer`** [^7]to each column and centrifuge at 16,000xg for 30s, then discard the flow-through

-   Add 400uL of **`DNA/RNA Wash Buffer`** to each column and centrifuge at 16,000xg for 2mins to ensure complete removal of the wash buffer, then discard the flow-through

-   Conduct a dry spin and centrifuge at 16,000xg for 2mins to ensure complete removal of the wash buffer prior to elution[^8]

-   Carefully transfer the column into the nuclease-free tube labelled for containing the eluted DNA/RNA end products

-   Add 70uL **`DNase/RNase-Free Water`** directly to the column matrix and centrifuge at 16,000xg for 30s

-   Place eluted DNA/RNA tubes on ice to continue work, or store in the -80C freezer for later

[^7]: Slowly dispense wash buffer along the sides of the filter like pouring a heady beer down the side of a pint glass. Jerry Yu from Zymo says:

    > "You are correct with the beer analogy. By slowly dispensing wash buffer along the inner radius of the column, you can rinse off salts/residuals from previous spins, so future spins will be cleaner."

[^8]: Another tip from Zymo:

    > The goal of rinsing and reducing the volume of wash buffer is to avoid residual buffer from previous washes to end up in the elution, which will reduce purity. If volume of the wash buffer is increased in the final wash step, make sure to also increase the centrifugation time (e.g., 2 minutes) or include a second spin without buffer (dry spin) to ensure complete removal of the buffer prior to elution.
