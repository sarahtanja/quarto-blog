## Samples

list of cryo_ID's:


## Key Results

| cryo_id | ex_id     | qubit_rna_1 | qubit_rna_2 | qubit_dna_1 | qubit_dna_2 | 
|---------|-----------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
















-   qubit_rna_1 was run by SST and NAH at 1140 on 25APR2023, Run ID 2023-04-25-110503
-   qubit_rna_2 and qubit_rna_3 were run on 2 separately prepared technical replicates by SST at 1340 on 25APR2023, Run ID 2023-04-25-133744
-   exported RNA Qubit Data file **(Run ID 2023-04-25-133744 & 2023-04-25-110503)** with more details can be found [HERE](https://github.com/sarahtanja/coral-DNA-RNA-lab-extractions/blob/main/data/QubitData_2023-04-25/QubitData_2023-04-25_13-41-07.csv)
-   qubit_dna was checked on 5/4/2023 because we were waiting for the Thermo Qubit DNA Broad Range (BR) Assay Kit to be delivered. Samples were frozen in a -80C freezer between extraction and being checked by Qubit for quantity
-   exported DNA Qubit Data file **(Run ID 2023-05-02-102849)** with more details can be found [HERE](https://github.com/sarahtanja/coral-DNA-RNA-lab-extractions/blob/main/data/QubitData_2023-05-02/QubitData_2023-05-02_10-32-16.csv)

Samples are stored in -80C 'sucks' freezer in respective `Eluted-DNA` or `Eluted-RNA` wax freezer boxes with the labels:
