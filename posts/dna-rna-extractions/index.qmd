-   2-CH1a: 1 scoop[^1], 2-PH2a: 2 scoops
-   Mass/volume of starting material is \~0.16g, or \~200-160uL per 'scoop' of powdered sample
-   Used 500uL of DNA/RNA Shield in each 2mL bead-bashing tube
-   Let proteinase K digestion incubate at room temp for 2 hours directly in bead bashing tube
-   Added DNA/RNA Lysis buffer directly to bead bashing tube
-   Transferred 400uL from bead bashing tube to yellow spin column
-   No RNA Clean & Concentrator
-   No DNA Clean & Concentrator

[^1]: Possibly the low input was a reason for the low DNA yeild

## Samples

-   3-CA1a
-   3-Ea

Samples were randomly selected for processing given constraints explained in [this RMarkdown document](https://github.com/sarahtanja/coral-DNA-RNA-lab-extractions/blob/main/rand-sample-processing.Rmd).

## Key Results

| cryo_id | qubit_dna_1 | qubit_dna_2 | qubit_dna_avg |
|---------|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| 3-CA1a  | 72.8        | 75          | 73.9          |
| 3-Ea    | 39          | 38.4        | 38.7          |

-   DNA Qubit was checked on 04-MAY-2023, [*Run ID 2023-05-02-102849*](https://github.com/sarahtanja/coral-DNA-RNA-lab-extractions/blob/main/data/QubitData_2023-05-02/QubitData_2023-05-02_10-32-16.csv) because we were waiting for the Thermo Qubit DNA Broad Range (BR) Assay Kit to be delivered. Samples were frozen in a -80C freezer between extraction and getting checked by Qubit for quantity

-   RNA Qubit was run by SST and NAH at 1140 on 25-APR-2023, [*Run ID 2023-04-25-110503*](https://github.com/sarahtanja/coral-DNA-RNA-lab-extractions/blob/main/data/QubitData_2023-04-25/QubitData_2023-04-25_13-41-07.csv) and on 2 separately prepared technical replicates by SST at 1340 on 25-APR-2023, [*Run ID 2023-04-25-133744*](https://github.com/sarahtanja/coral-DNA-RNA-lab-extractions/blob/main/data/QubitData_2023-04-25/QubitData_2023-04-25_13-41-07.csv)

Samples are stored in -80C freezer in respective `Eluted-DNA` or `Eluted-RNA` wax freezer boxes.

## Extraction Notes

-   extractions were started by SST and NAH and finished by SST on 21-APR-2023 ::: column-margin ![mortar and pestle with cryogloves](PXL_20230421_213402619.jpg){width="3in"} :::

-   `3-CA1a` pestled 1st, half of the material in the cryo vial was used. Half remains in the freezer.

-   `3-Ea` pestled 2nd, all of the material in the cryo vial was used, but half fell on the floor and had to be thrown out.

-   LN2 evaporates very quickly and had to be replenished multiple times

-   We did this with two people (NAH to grind, SST to carefully dispense LN2)

::: callout-warning
The coral is very hard to pestle and prone to 'squirting out' from under the pestle! Learned that it is better to leverage whole body weight above the mortar and work to crush the coral fragment like a hydraulic press. When pestling sample 3-Ea at an angle, half of the fragment shot out of the mortar and ended up on the floor (which was discarded and not used), resulting in less starting material left to use in the mortar. **This could be a reason why 3-Ea had 'out of range, too low' result for Qubit!**
:::

-   Used [sterilized](#sterilize) scoopula to transfer the sample powder to its correspondingly labelled [bead bashing tube](https://www.zymoresearch.com/collections/lysis-tubes/products/zr-bashingbead-lysis-tubes-0-1-0-5-mm).

For this step we made small disposable funnels from lab weigh-paper and label tape to try and make this easier. ⚠️**Unfortunately, this didn't work very well!** ⚠️ Finely ground powder melts fast and the cold from the LN2 means that all the moisture in the lab is condensing on the sample. As soon as it is removed from the mortar by the scoopula it begins to melt , condense water vapor, and turn into a sticky booger! It doesn't slide nice and dry down the paper funnel. We had to tamp it vigorously to get it into the bead bashing tube.

::: callout-tip
Fixed the melting booger problem by getting [small metal funnels](https://www.amazon.com/Yansanido-Stainless-Miniature-Essential-Lipbalms/dp/B086MCNT66/ref=sxts_rp_s_a_1_0?content-id=amzn1.sym.3432eb1a-1558-4445-9430-9bb3e7f7b9b7%3Aamzn1.sym.3432eb1a-1558-4445-9430-9bb3e7f7b9b7&cv_ct_cx=small+metal+funnel&keywords=small+metal+funnel&pd_rd_i=B086MCNT66&pd_rd_r=ea974960-1e0a-42ee-ad24-697dac76e00c&pd_rd_w=qJ6ax&pd_rd_wg=BfUCw&pf_rd_p=3432eb1a-1558-4445-9430-9bb3e7f7b9b7&pf_rd_r=1F9G2RCT07066Q1KP00D&qid=1685747165&sbo=RZvfv%2F%2FHxDF%2BO5021pAnSA%3D%3D&sr=1-1-5985efba-8948-4f09-9122-d605505c9d1e) and metal scoopulas and chilling them on dry-ice, with the goal being to **keep the powder cold during the transfer from the mortar to inside the bead bashing tube**. This worked really well!

:::

-   Once the sample powder was in the bead bashing tube, we quickly added `750uL` of `DNA/RNA Sheild` to the bead bashing tube, shook it vigorously & vortexed it to ensure the sample was submersed in `DNA/RNA Sheild`

::: callout-warning
After bead beating tube was very very bubbly! Would suggest centrifuging after the bead-beating homogenization 'shaker' step prior to opening tube lid and putting it in the bead bashing tube before the sample in future extractions.
:::

-   We then set bead-bashing tubes in the `Mortexer` and let it mix at max speed for **40 mins**
-   Added `30uL` of Proteinase-K Digestion Buffer directly to the bead bashing tube
-   Added `15uL` of Proteinase-K directly to the bead bashing tube
-   Incubated (left to sit) at room temp for **30 minutes**
-   eluted 100ul of DNA in nuclease-free water
-   eluted 100ul of RNA in nuclease-free water
-   No RNA Clean & Concentrator
-   No DNA Clean & Concentrator
