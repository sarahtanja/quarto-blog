	abstract = {Microplastic debris is a pervasive type of contaminant in marine ecosystems, being considered a major threat to marine biota. One of the problems of microplastics is that they can adsorb contaminants in extremely high concentrations. When released from the particle, these contaminants have the potential to cause toxic effects in the biota. So far, reports of toxic effects are mostly linked with the direct exposure of organisms through ingestion of contaminated microplastics. There is little information on the toxicity of leachates from microplastics to marine organisms. In this study, we conducted experiments to evaluate the toxicity of leachates from virgin and beached plastic pellets to embryo development of the brown mussel (Perna perna). We compared the efficiency of two test procedures, and evaluated the toxicity of beached pellets collected in a coastal marine protected area. We observed that mussel embryo is sensitive to leachate from both virgin and beached pellets. However, the toxicity of the leachate from beached pellets was much higher than that of virgin pellets. We suggest contaminants adsorbed onto the surface of beached pellets were responsible for the high toxicity of leachate from beached pellets, while the toxicity of leachate from virgin pellets was mainly due to plastic additives. Our results suggest microplastic debris may be harmful even if ingestion is not the only or main pathway of interaction of marine organisms with contaminated plastic debris.},

	abstract = {Ecosystems in remote regions tend to be highly specific, having historically evolved over long timescales in relatively constant environmental conditions, with little human influence. Such regions are amongst those most physically altering and biologically threatened by global climate change. In addition, they are increasingly receiving anthropogenic pollution. Microplastic pollution has now been found in these most remote places on earth, far from most human activities. Microplastics can induce complex and wide-ranging physical and chemical effects but little to date is known of their long-term biological impacts. In combination with climate-induced stress, microplastics may lead to enhanced multi-stress impacts, potentially affecting the health and resilience of species and ecosystems. While species in historically populated areas have had some opportunity to adapt to mounting human influence over centuries and millennia, the relatively rapid intensification of widespread anthropogenic activities in recent decades has provided species in previously ‘untouched’ regions little such opportunities. The characteristics of remote ecosystems and the species therein suggest that they could be more sensitive to the combined effects of microplastic pollution, global physical change and other stressors than elsewhere. Here we discuss how species and ecosystems within two remote yet contrasting regions, coastal Antarctica and the deep sea, might be especially vulnerable to harm from microplastic pollution in the context of a rapidly changing environment.},

	abstract = {Anthropogenic stressors can affect individual species and alter species interactions. Moreover, species interactions or the presence of multiple stressors can modify the stressor effects, yet most work focuses on single stressors and single species. Plant-microbe interactions are a class of species interactions on which ecosystems and agricultural systems depend, yet may be affected by multiple global change stressors. Here, we use duckweed and microbes from its microbiome to model responses of interacting plants and microbes to multiple stressors: climate change and tire wear particles. Climate change is occurring globally, and microplastic tire wear particles from roads now reach many ecosystems. We paired perpendicular gradients of temperature and carbon dioxide ({CO}2) treatments with factorial manipulation of leachate from tire wear particles and duckweed microbiomes. We found that tire leachate and warmer temperatures enhanced duckweed and microbial growth, but caused effects of microbes on duckweed to become negative. However, induced negative effects of microbes were less than additive with warming and leachate. Without tire leachate, we observed that higher {CO}2 and temperature induced positive correlations between duckweed and microbial growth, which can strengthen mutualisms. In contrast, with tire leachate, growth correlations were never positive, and shifted negative at lower {CO}2, again suggesting leachate disrupts this plant-microbiome mutualism. In summary, our results demonstrate that multiple interacting stressors can affect multiple interacting species, and that leachate from tire wear particles could potentially disrupt plant-microbe mutualisms.},

We quantified the density of microplastics found on the surfaces of three species of intertidal seagrasses (Cymodocea rotundata, Cymodocea serrulata and Thalassia hemprichii) and two species of subtidal macroalgae (Padina sp. and Sargassum ilicifolium), and found significantly higher microplastic densities on seagrasses than on macroalgae.

However, observed diﬀerences in species susceptibility to the disease are not well understood. Here, we examined the susceptibility of three temperate abalone species, the cool water (4–14 °C) pinto or northern abalone (Haliotis kamtschatkana), the intermediate water (8–18 °C) red abalone (H. rufescens), and the warm water (12–23 °C) pink abalone (H. corrugata), to experimental {WS} infection at temperatures facilitating disease proliferation. Mortality data paired with histological and molecular detection of the {WS} pathogen conﬁrmed that these abalone species exhibit diﬀerent levels of susceptibility to infection and resistance to {WS} development ranging from high susceptibility and low resistance in pinto abalone to moderate/low susceptibility and resistance in red and pink abalones. The temperature associated with {WS} induced mortalities also varied among species: pinto abalone died at the lowest experimental temperature (17.32 ± 0.09 °C), while red abalone died at an intermediate temperature (17.96 ± 0.16 °C), and pink abalone required the highest temperature (18.84 ± 0.16 °C). When data from the current and previous studies were examined, susceptibility to {WS} was inversely related to phylogenetic distance from white abalone (H. sorenseni), which had the highest susceptibility and lowest resistance of all abalone species tested prior to the current study. These results provide further evidence that an abalone’s thermal optima and phylogenetic relationship can determine its susceptibility to {WS}; species with cool water evolutionary histories are most susceptible to {WS} and the most susceptible species appear to be closely related. Diﬀerences among the thermal ranges of abalone species have broad implications for {WS} disease dynamics and highlight the importance of understanding the mechanisms governing the abalone-{WS} relationship in order to properly manage declining abalone populations.},

              Rising sea temperatures and increasing pollution threaten the fate of coral reefs and millions of people who depend on them. Some reef-building corals respond to thermal stress and subsequent bleaching with increases in heterotrophy, which may increase the risk of ingesting microplastics. Whether this heterotrophic plasticity affects microplastics ingestion or whether ingesting microplastics affects heterotrophic feeding in corals is unknown. To determine this, two coral species,
              Montipora capitata
              and
              Pocillopora damicornis
              , were exposed to ambient ({\textasciitilde}27 °C) and increased ({\textasciitilde}30 °C) temperature and then fed microplastics,
              Artemia
              nauplii, or both. Following thermal stress, both species significantly reduced feeding on
              Artemia

              P

              damicornis
              only ingested microplastics when
              Artemia
              were also present, providing evidence that microplastics are not selectively ingested by this species and are only incidentally ingested when food is available. As the first study to examine microplastics ingestion following thermal stress in corals, our results highlight the variability in the risk of microplastics ingestion among species and the importance of considering multiple drivers to project how corals will be affected by global change.},

	abstract = {The aquaculture sector is anticipated to be a keystone in food production systems in the coming decades. However, it is associated with potentially important environmental damages caused by its contribution to eutrophication or climate change, for example. To comprehensively quantify those impacts, life cycle assessment ({LCA}) studies have been conducted on several seafood farming systems for the past 15 years. But, what major ﬁndings and common trends can we draw from this pool of studies? What can we learn to provide recommendations to decision and policymakers in the aquaculture sector? To address these questions, we performed a critical review of 65 {LCA} studies of aquaculture systems from the open literature. We conducted quantitative analyses to explore which impacts can be identiﬁed as dominating and to compare different types of aquaculture systems. Our results evidenced that the feed production is a key driver for climate change, acidiﬁcation, cumulative energy use and net primary production use, while the farming process is a key driver for eutrophication. We also found that different aquaculture systems and technology components may exert considerably different environmental impacts. Based on identiﬁed patterns and comparisons, we therefore provided speciﬁc recommendations to aquaculture stakeholders for future policy and system development. Overall, the analysis of existing studies demonstrates that important insights can be gained by applying {LCA} to aquaculture systems, and, to move towards an environmentally sustainable aquaculture sector, we recommend its systematic use in the design of new aquaculture systems or policies, and/or in the evaluation and optimization of existing ones.},

At the same time, it produces large amounts of pollution - from non-biodegradable materials such as plastics, to toxic liquids and greenhouse gases, known for their contribution to climate change. The circular economy is a model of production and consumption which aims to move closer to the cyclical processes in nature whereby waste from one species is broken down, for example into nutrients, and used by another. It prioritises the use of renewable and sustainably sourced materials, facilitating their post-use composting to regenerate the natural systems we have tapped into. When it comes to the production of non-biodegradable products, such as machinery, it involves organising production to recuperate, reuse and recycle the parts and materials that went into those products.},

	abstract = {Plastic pollution is a global threat to marine ecosystems. Plastic litter can leach a variety of substances into marine environments; however, virtually nothing is known regarding how this affects photosynthetic bacteria at the base of the marine food web. To address this, we investigated the effect of plastic leachate exposure on marine Prochlorococcus, widely considered the most abundant photosynthetic organism on Earth and vital contributors to global primary production and carbon cycling. Two strains of Prochlorococcus representing distinct ecotypes were exposed to leachate from common plastic items: high-density polyethylene bags and polyvinyl chloride matting. We show leachate exposure strongly impairs Prochlorococcus in vitro growth and photosynthetic capacity and results in genome-wide transcriptional changes. The strains showed distinct differences in the extent and timing of their response to each leachate. Consequently, plastic leachate exposure could influence marine Prochlorococcus community composition and potentially the broader composition and productivity of ocean phytoplankton communities., Sasha Tetu et al. have examined the effects of plastic leachate exposure on the marine bacteria Prochlorococcus, the most abundant photosynthetic organism on Earth. They find plastic leachates impair growth, photosynthetic capacity and cause global changes in transcription.},

	abstract = {Plastic pollution is a defining environmental contaminant and is considered to be one of the greatest environmental threats of the Anthropocene, with its presence documented across aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. The majority of this plastic debris falls into the micro (1 lm–5 mm) or nano (1–1000 nm) size range and comes from primary and secondary sources. Its small size makes it cumbersome to isolate and analyze reproducibly, and its ubiquitous distribution creates numerous challenges when controlling for background contamination across matrices (e.g., sediment, tissue, water, air). Although research on microplastics represents a relatively nascent subfield, burgeoning interest in questions surrounding the fate and effects of these debris items creates a pressing need for harmonized sampling protocols and quality control approaches. For results across laboratories to be reproducible and comparable, it is imperative that guidelines based on vetted protocols be readily available to research groups, many of which are either new to plastics research or, as with any new subfield, have arrived at current approaches through a process of trial-and-error rather than in consultation with the greater scientific community. The goals of this manuscript are to (i) outline the steps necessary to conduct general as well as matrix-specific quality assurance and quality control based on sample type and associated constraints, (ii) briefly review current findings across matrices, and (iii) provide guidance for the design of sampling regimes. Specific attention is paid to the source of microplastic pollution as well as the pathway by which contamination occurs, with details provided regarding each step in the process from generating appropriate questions to sampling design and collection.},

Critical studies have revealed the abundance of microplastics in nature, while others have tested the impacts of these small plastics on organismal health in the laboratory. Yet, there is often a mismatch between these two areas of research, resulting in major discrepancies and an inability to interpret certain ﬁndings. Here, we focus on several main lines of inquiry. First, even though the majority of environmental microplastics are plastic microﬁbers from textiles, laboratory studies still largely use spherical microbeads. There are also inconsistencies between the measurements of microplastics in the environment as compared to the concentrations that tend to be used in experimental studies. Likewise, the period of exposure occurring in experimental studies and in the environment are vastly different. Lastly, although experimental studies often focus on a particular subset of toxic chemicals present on microplastics, textile microﬁbers carry other dyes and chemicals that are understudied. They also cause types of physical damage not associated with microspheres. This review will analyze the literature pertaining to these mismatches, focusing on aquatic organisms and model systems, and seek to inform a path forward for this burgeoning area of research.},

	abstract = {Fishing can drive changes in important phenotypic traits through plastic and evolutionary pathways. Size-­selective harvest is a primary driver of such trait change, has received much attention in the literature and is now commonly considered in fisheries management. The potential for selection on behavioural traits has received less study, but mounting evidence suggests that aggression, foraging behaviour and linked traits can also be affected by fishing. An important phenomenon that has received much less attention is selection on reproductive phenology (i.e., the timing of breeding). The potential for this type of “temporal selection” is widespread because there is often substantial variability in reproductive phenology within fish populations, and fisheries management strategies or fishermen’s behaviours can cause fishing effort to vary greatly over time. For example, seasonal closures may expose only early or late breeding individuals to harvest as observed in a range of marine and freshwater fisheries. Such selection may induce evolutionary responses in phenological traits, but can also have demographic impacts such as shortened breeding seasons and reduced phenotypic diversity. These changes can in turn influence productivity, reduce the efficacy of management, exacerbate ongoing climate-­driven changes in phenology and reduce resilience to environmental change. In this essay, we describe how fisheries management can cause temporal variability in harvest, and describe the types of selection on temporal traits that can result. We then summarize the likely biological consequences of temporally selective fishing on populations and population complexes and conclude by identifying areas for future research.},

We studied the effects of different fallowing periods on the recovery of macrofauna at two salmon farms in Norway. The macrofauna at the farm stations were characterised by high abundances of opportunistic taxa (e.g. Capitella spp.), low diversity and significantly different community structure compared to reference sites. The fallowing initiated macrofauna recovery at both farm stations, indicated by a decline of dominant opportunistic taxa after 2months. Significant changes in taxa composition occurred only after 6months, although indications of disturbance were still evident. Surprisingly, no corresponding spatial or temporal differences were found in the sediment parameters such as redox, {TOC} and {pH}. The results suggest that macrofauna is a more sensitive indicator and that the seasonal timing of fallowing may affect recovery dynamics.},

	abstract = {Global plastic production has increased exponentially since manufacturing commenced in the 1950’s, including polymer types infused with diverse additives and fillers. While the negative impacts of plastics are widely reported, particularly on marine vertebrates, impacts on microbial life remain poorly understood. Plastics impact microbiomes directly, exerting toxic effects, providing supplemental carbon sources and acting as rafts for microbial colonisation and dispersal. Indirect consequences include increased environmental shading, altered compositions of host communities and disruption of host organism or community health, hormone balances and immune responses. The isolation and application of plastic-degrading microbes are of substantial interest yet little evidence supports the microbial biodegradation of most high molecular weight synthetic polymers. Over 400 microbial species have been presumptively identified as capable of plastic degradation, but evidence for the degradation of highly prevalent polymers including polypropylene, nylon, polystyrene and polyvinyl chloride must be treated with caution; most studies fail to differentiate losses caused by the leaching or degradation of polymer monomers, additives or fillers. Even where polymer degradation is demonstrated, such as for polyethylene terephthalate, the ability of microorganisms to degrade more highly crystalline forms of the polymer used in commercial plastics appears limited. Microbiomes frequently work in conjunction with abiotic factors such as heat and light to impact the structural integrity of polymers and accessibility to enzymatic attack. Consequently, there remains much scope for extremophile microbiomes to be explored as a source of plastic-degrading enzymes and microorganisms. We propose a best-practice workflow for isolating and reporting plastic-degrading taxa from diverse environmental microbiomes, which should include multiple lines of evidence supporting changes in polymer structure, mass loss, and detection of presumed degradation products, along with confirmation of microbial strains and enzymes (and their associated genes) responsible for high molecular weight plastic polymer degradation. Such approaches are necessary for enzymatic degraders of high molecular weight plastic polymers to be differentiated from organisms only capable of degrading the more labile carbon within predominantly amorphous plastics, plastic monomers, additives or fillers.},

	abstract = {Open marine net pens facilitate virus and sea lice transfer, occasionally leading to infections and outbreaks of disease in farmed salmon. A review of 3 salmon pathogens (infectious salmon anaemia virus [{ISAV}], salmon alphavirus [{SAV}] and the salmon louse Lepeophtheirus salmonis) shows that increased risk of exposure to neighbouring farms is inversely related to distance from and directly related to biomass at the source of infection. Epidemiological techniques integrating data from oceanography, diagnostics and pathogen shedding rates and viability contribute to improved understanding of pathogen transmission pathways among farms and permit the designation of areas of risk associated with sources of infection. Occupation of an area of risk may increase the likelihood of exposure, infection and disease among susceptible fish. Disease mitigation in mariculture occurs at 2 scales: area-based (coordinated stocking, harvesting and fallowing) and farm-based (vaccination, early pathogen detection, veterinary prescribed treatments and depopulation or early harvest in the event of viral disease). Collectively, implementation of mitigation measures results in virus disease outbreaks of shorter duration with lower mortality and therefore reduces the likelihood of pathogen transmission. In contrast, the mitigation of sea lice transmission is less likely to be effective in some areas due to the loss of parasite sensitivity to therapeutants and to dissemination of larval lice when parasites occur below management thresholds. For wild populations, risk of pathogen spillback is estimated from farm-based epidemiological data; however, validation, particularly for {ISAV} and {SAV}, is required using direct surveillance.},

A large piece of polystyrene ({PS}) foam (34 × 31 × 5 cm) covered by microalgae, moss, lichens and microfauna was found in a fellfield along the shores of the Fildes Peninsula (King George Island). The application of an improved enzymatic digestion coupled with Fourier transform infrared microscopy (µ-{FTIR}), unequivocally detected traces of {PS} (less than 100 µm) in the gut of the collembolans associated with the {PS} foam and documented their ability to ingest plastic. Plastics are thus entering the short Antarctic terrestrial food webs and represent a new potential stressor to polar ecosystems already facing climate change and increasing human activities. Future research should explore the effects of plastics on the composition, structure and functions of polar terrestrial biota.},

	abstract = {Marine protected areas ({MPAs}) are conservation tools that are increasingly implemented, with growing national commitments for {MPA} expansion. Perhaps the greatest challenge to expanded use of {MPAs} is the perceived trade-off between protection and food production. Since {MPAs} can benefit both conservation and fisheries in areas experiencing overfishing and since overfishing is common in many coastal nations, we ask how {MPAs} can be designed specifically to improve fisheries yields. We assembled distribution, life history, and fisheries exploitation data for 1,338 commercially important stocks to derive an optimized network of {MPAs} globally. We show that strategically expanding the existing global {MPA} network to protect an additional 5\% of the ocean could increase future catch by at least 20\% via spillover, generating 9 to 12 million metric tons more food annually than in a business-as-usual world with no additional protection. Our results demonstrate how food provisioning can be a central driver of {MPA} design, offering a pathway to strategically conserve ocean areas while securing seafood for the future.},

	abstract = {Marine protected areas ({MPAs}) cover 3–7\% of the world’s ocean, and international organizations call for 30\% coverage by 2030. Although numerous studies show that {MPAs} produce conservation beneﬁts inside their borders, many {MPAs} are also justiﬁed on the grounds that they confer conservation beneﬁts to the connected populations that span beyond their borders. A network of {MPAs} covering roughly 20\% of the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary was established in 2003, with a goal of providing regional conservation and ﬁshery beneﬁts. We used a spatially explicit bioeconomic simulation model and a Bayesian difference-in-difference regression to examine the conditions under which {MPAs} can provide population-level conservation beneﬁts inside and outside their borders and to assess evidence of those beneﬁts in the Channel Islands. As of 2017, we estimated that biomass densities of targeted ﬁn-ﬁsh had a median value 81\% higher (90\% credible interval: 23–148) inside the Channel Island {MPAs} than outside. However, we found no clear effect of these {MPAs} on mean total biomass densities at the population level: estimated median effect was –7\% (90\% credible interval: –31 to 23) from 2015 to 2017. Our simulation model showed that effect sizes of {MPAs} of {\textless}30\% were likely to be difﬁcult to detect (even when they were present); smaller effect sizes (which are likely to be common) were even harder to detect. Clearly, communicating expectations and uncertainties around {MPAs} is critical to ensuring that {MPAs} are effective. We provide a novel assessment of the population-level effects of a large {MPA} network across many different species of targeted ﬁn-ﬁsh, and our results offer guidance for communities charged with monitoring and adapting {MPAs}.},

	abstract = {In Greenland, polar bears (Ursus maritimus) are nutritional, economic, and cultural subsistence resources for Inuit. Traditional Ecological Knowledge ({TEK}) collected from subsistence hunters can provide important insights and improve management decisions when collected systematically. We report on the results of a {TEK} survey of subsistence polar bear hunters living in the areas around Tasiilaq and Ittoqqortoormiit, East Greenland. Twenty-ﬁve full-time polar bear hunters were interviewed between December 2014 and March 2015 in a conversation-style interview, where a local interviewer ﬂuent in the East Greenlandic dialect asked a series of 55 predetermined questions. The primary goals were to (1) gather Inuit perspectives on polar bear subsistence quotas and hunting strategies, (2) understand how climate change is affecting the polar bear subsistence hunt, and (3) document observed changes in polar bear distribution, abundance, and biology. Approximately 40\% of the Tasiilaq respondents had caught between 10 and 19 polar bears in their lifetime, while 67\% of Ittoqqortoormiit respondents reported lifetime catches of ≥20 bears. In both areas, polar bears were most commonly hunted between February and April. Hunters noted large changes to the climate in the areas where they hunt polar bears. Most hunters reported loss of sea ice, receding glaciers, unstable weather, and warmer temperatures. In Tasiilaq 73\% of the hunters said climate changes had affected the polar bear hunt and in Ittoqqortoormiit about 88\% of respondents reported the same. Hunters indicated that sea ice loss has created more areas of open water so dog sledges have become unsafe for hunting transportation compared to 10–15 years ago (reported by 100\% of hunters in Tasiilaq and 80\% in Ittoqqortoormiit). In Ittoqqortoormiit, the distance traveled during polar bear hunting trips has decreased dramatically. In both areas hunters noted that more polar bears are coming into their communities compared to 10–15 years ago (81\% of Tasiilaq hunters and 78\% of Ittoqqortoormiit hunters) and pointed to the introduction of quotas and loss of sea ice as potential reasons. This study provides an important perspective on the East Greenland subpopulation of polar bears that can be used to direct science questions and inform management.},

	abstract = {Climate change has broad ecological implications for species that rely on sensitive habitats. For some top predators, loss of habitat is expected to lead to cascading behavioral, nutritional, and reproductive changes that ultimately accelerate population declines. In the case of the polar bear (Ursus maritimus), declining Arctic sea ice reduces access to prey and lengthens seasonal fasting periods. We used a novel combination of physical capture, biopsy darting, and visual aerial observation data to project reproductive performance for polar bears by linking sea ice loss to changes in habitat use, body condition (i.e., fatness), and cub production. Satellite telemetry data from 43 (1991–1997) and 38 (2009–2015) adult female polar bears in the Baffin Bay subpopulation showed that bears now spend an additional 30 d on land (90 d in total) in the 2000s compared to the 1990s, a change closely correlated with changes in spring sea ice breakup and fall sea ice formation. Body condition declined for all sex, age, and reproductive classes and was positively correlated with sea ice availability in the current and previous year. Furthermore, cub litter size was positively correlated with maternal condition and spring breakup date (i.e., later breakup leading to larger litters), and negatively correlated with the duration of the ice-free period (i.e., longer ice-free periods leading to smaller litters). Based on these relationships, we projected reproductive performance three polar bear generations into the future (approximately 35 yr). Results indicate that two-cub litters, previously the norm, could largely disappear from Baffin Bay as sea ice loss continues. Our findings demonstrate how concurrent analysis of multiple data types collected over long periods from polar bears can provide a mechanistic understanding of the ecological implications of climate change. This information is needed for long-term conservation planning, which includes quantitative harvest risk assessments that incorporate estimated or assumed trends in future environmental carrying capacity.},

	abstract = {Plastics are persistent synthetic polymers that accumulate as waste in the marine environment. Microplastic ({MP}) particles are derived from the breakdown of larger debris or can enter the environment as microscopic fragments. Because filter-feeder organisms ingest {MP} while feeding, they are likely to be impacted by {MP} pollution. To assess the impact of polystyrene microspheres (micro-{PS}) on the physiology of the Pacific oyster, adult oysters were experimentally exposed to virgin micro-{PS} (2 and 6 µm in diameter; 0.023 mg·L−1) for 2 mo during a reproductive cycle. Effects were investigated on ecophysiological parameters; cellular, transcriptomic, and proteomic responses; fecundity; and offspring development. Oysters preferentially ingested the 6-µm micro-{PS} over the 2-µm-diameter particles. Consumption of microalgae and absorption efficiency were significantly higher in exposed oysters, suggesting compensatory and physical effects on both digestive parameters. After 2 mo, exposed oysters had significant decreases in oocyte number (−38\%), diameter (−5\%), and sperm velocity (−23\%). The D-larval yield and larval development of offspring derived from exposed parents decreased by 41\% and 18\%, respectively, compared with control offspring. Dynamic energy budget modeling, supported by transcriptomic profiles, suggested a significant shift of energy allocation from reproduction to structural growth, and elevated maintenance costs in exposed oysters, which is thought to be caused by interference with energy uptake. Molecular signatures of endocrine disruption were also revealed, but no endocrine disruptors were found in the biological samples. This study provides evidence that micro-{PS} cause feeding modifications and reproductive disruption in oysters, with significant impacts on offspring.},

	abstract = {Coral diseases have increased in frequency and intensity around the tropics worldwide. However, in many cases, little is known about their etiology. Montipora white syndrome ({MWS}) is a common disease affecting the coral Montipora capitata, a major reef builder in Hawai'i. Chronic Montipora white syndrome ({cMWS}) is a slow-moving form of the disease that affects M. capitata throughout the year. The effects of this chronic disease on coral immunology and microbiology are currently unknown. In this study, we use prophenoloxidase immune assays and 16S {rRNA} gene amplicon sequencing to characterize the microbiome and immunological response associated with {cMWS}. Our results show that immunological and microbiological responses are highly localized. Relative to diseased samples, apparently healthy portions of {cMWS} corals differed in immune activity and in the relative abundance of microbial taxa. Coral tissues with {cMWS} showed decreased tyrosinase-type catecholase and tyrosinase-type cresolase activity and increased laccase-type activity. Catecholase and cresolase activity were negatively correlated across all tissue types with microbiome richness. The localized effect of {cMWS} on coral microbiology and immunology is probably an important reason for the slow progression of the disease. This local confinement may facilitate interventions that focus on localized treatments on tissue types. This study provides an important baseline to understand the interplay between the microbiome and immune system and the mechanisms used by corals to manage chronic microbial perturbations associated with white syndrome.},

Microplastics come in a wide variety of shapes, sizes, and plastic types, each with unique physical and chemical properties and toxicological impacts. Understanding the magnitude of the microplastic problem and determining the highest priorities for mitigation require accurate measures of microplastic occurrence in the environment and identification of likely sources. The field of microplastic pollution is in its infancy, and there are not yet widely accepted standards for sample collection, laboratory analyses, quality assurance/quality control ({QA}/{QC}), or reporting of microplastics in environmental samples. Based on a comprehensive assessment of microplastics in San Francisco Bay water, sediment, fish, bivalves, stormwater, and wastewater effluent, we developed recommended best practices for collecting, analyzing, and reporting microplastics in environmental media. We recommend factors to consider in microplastic study design, particularly in regard to site selection and sampling methods. We also highlight the need for standard {QA}/{QC} practices such as collection of field and laboratory blanks, use of methods beyond microscopy to identify particle composition, and standardized reporting practices, including suggested vocabulary for particle classification.},

However, most knowledge of the coral microbiome has come from reef-building scleractinian corals, with far less known about the nature and importance of the microbiome of octocorals (subclass Octocorallia), which contribute significantly to reef biodiversity and functional complexity. We examined the diversity and structure of the bacterial component of octocoral microbiomes over summer and winter, with a focus on two temperate (Erythropodium hicksoni, Capnella gaboensis; Sydney Harbour) and two tropical (Sinularia sp., Sarcophyton sp.; Heron Island) species common to reefs in eastern Australia. Bacterial communities associated with these octocorals were also compared to common temperate (Plesiastrea versipora) and tropical (Acropora aspera) hard corals from the same reefs. Using 16S {rRNA} amplicon sequencing, bacterial diversity was found to be heterogeneous among octocorals, but we observed changes in composition between summer and winter for some species (C. gaboensis and Sinularia sp.), but not for others (E. hicksoni and Sarcophyton sp.). Bacterial community structure differed significantly between all octocoral species within both the temperate and tropical environments. However, on a seasonal basis, those differences were less pronounced. The microbiomes of C. gaboensis and Sinularia sp. were dominated by bacteria belonging to the genus Endozoicomonas, which were a key conserved feature of their core microbiomes. In contrast to previous studies, our analysis revealed that Endozoicomonas phylotypes are shared across different octocoral species, inhabiting different environments. Together, our data demonstrates that octocorals harbour a broad diversity of bacterial partners, some of which comprise ‘core microbiomes’ that potentially impart important functional roles to their hosts.},

However, most studies to date, particularly studies on bacterial communities, have examined temporal variation over a time frame of less than 1 year, which is insufficient to establish if microbiome variations are indeed seasonal in nature. The present study focused on expanding our understanding of long-term variability in microbial community composition using two common coral species, Acropora hyacinthus, and Acropora spathulata, at two mid-shelf reefs on the Great Barrier Reef. By sampling over a 2-year time period, this study aimed to determine whether temporal variations reflect seasonal cycles. Community composition of both bacteria and Symbiodiniaceae was characterized through 16S {rRNA} gene and {ITS}2 {rDNA} metabarcoding. We observed significant variations in community composition of both bacteria and Symbiodiniaceae among time points for A. hyacinthus and A. spathulata. However, there was no evidence to suggest that temporal variations were cyclical in nature and represented seasonal variation. Clear evidence for differences in the microbial communities found between reefs suggests that reef location and coral species play a larger role than season in driving microbial community composition in corals. In order to identify the basis of temporal patterns in coral microbial community composition, future studies should employ longer time series of sampling at sufficient temporal resolution to identify the environmental correlates of microbiome variation.},

At present, most of the studies on the toxicity of microplastics are concentrated on aquatic feeding animals, but relatively few have addressed freshwater algae. This study investigated the effect of microplastics (polypropylene ({PP}) and polyvinyl chloride ({PVC})) exposure on the photosynthetic system of freshwater algae over the logarithmic growth period. The results showed that both {PVC} and {PP} had a negative effect on chlorophyll a concentrations of Chlorella (C.) pyrenoidosa and Microcystis (M.) flos-aquae; among them, when the concentration of {PVC} exceeded 250 mg/L, compared with the control group, the chlorophyll a content of C. pyrenoidosa was reduced by 55.23\%. For photosynthetic activity, higher concentrations of {PVC} and {PP} can induce lower values of Fv/Fm, Fv/F0, and Fv’/Fm’, suggesting a larger impact in algae. However, algae were able to adjust, with increased values of Fv/Fm, Fv/F0, and Fv’/Fm’. This dose-negative effect phenomenon also exists in the study of the rapid light-response curves. In addition, comparing the two microplastics, we could see that {PVC} greatly inhibits the photosynthesis system of freshwater algae. Our study confirmed that microplastics can affect algae growth under certain concentrations, which provides evidence for understanding the risks of microplastics.},

This critical issue affects both sea life and human beings since microplastics can enter the food chain and cause several health impacts. Plastic recycling, chemical treatments, incineration and landfill are apparently not the optimum solutions for reducing plastic pollution. Hence, this review presents two newly identified environmentally friendly approaches, plastic biodegradation and bioplastic production using algae, to solve the increased global plastic waste. Algae, particularly microalgae, can degrade the plastic materials through the toxins systems or enzymes synthesized by microalgae itself while using the plastic polymers as carbon sources. Utilizing algae for plastic biodegradation has been critically reviewed in this paper to demonstrate the mechanism and how microplastics affect the algae. On the other hand, algae-derived bioplastics have identical properties and characteristics as petroleum-based plastics, while remarkably being biodegradable in nature. This review provides new insights into different methods of producing algae-based bioplastics (e.g., blending with other materials and genetic engineering), followed by the discussion on the challenges and further research direction to increase their commercial feasibility.},

Our estimates indicate that globally up to 23,600 metric tons of {DOC} are leaching from marine plastics annually. About 60\% of it is available to microbial utilization in less than 5 days. If exposed to solar radiation, however, this {DOC} becomes less labile. Thus, plastic pollution of marine surface waters likely alters the composition and activity of the base of the marine food webs. It is predicted that plastic waste entering the ocean will increase by a factor of ten within the next decade, resulting in an increase in plastic-derived {DOC} that might have unaccounted consequences for marine microbes and for the ocean system.},

Additives include bisphenols, phthalates, flame retardants, and further emerging and legacy contaminants. With a few exceptions, additives are not chemically bound to the polymer, and potentially migrate within the material reaching its surface, then possibly leach out to the environment. Leachates are mixtures of additives, some of which belong to the list of emerging contaminants, i.e. substances that show the potential to pose risks to the environment and human health, while are not yet regulated. The review discusses the state of the art and gaps concerning the hidden threat of plastic leachates. The focus is on reports addressing the biological impacts of plastic leachates as a whole mixture. Degradation of plastics, including the weathering-driven fragmentation, and the release of additives, are analysed together with the techniques currently employed for chemically screening leachates. Because marine plastic litter is a major concern, the review mainly focuses on the effects of plastic leachates on marine flora and fauna. Moreover, it also addresses impacts on freshwater organisms. Finally, research needs and perspectives are examined, to promote better focused investigations, that may support developing different plastic materials and new regulations.},

	abstract = {Synthetic polymer-based materials are ubiquitous in aquatic environments, where weathering processes lead to their progressive fragmentation and the leaching of additive chemicals. The current study assessed the chemical content of freshwater and marine leachates produced from car tire rubber ({CTR}), polypropylene ({PP}), polyethylene terephthalate ({PET}), polystyrene ({PS}) and polyvinyl chloride ({PVC}) microplastics, and their adverse effects on the microalgae Raphidocelis subcapitata (freshwater) and Skeletonema costatum (marine) and the Mediterranean mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis. A combination of non-target and target chemical analysis revealed a number of organic and metal compounds in the leachates, including representing plasticizers, antioxidants, antimicrobials, lubricants, and vulcanizers. {CTR} and {PVC} materials and their corresponding leachates had the highest content of tentatively identified organic additives, while {PET} had the lowest. The metal content varied both between polymer leachates and between freshwater and seawater. Notable additives identified in high concentrations were benzothiazole ({CTR}), phthalide ({PVC}), acetophenone ({PP}), cobalt ({CTR}, {PET}), zinc ({CTR}, {PVC}), lead ({PP}) and antimony ({PET}). All leachates, except {PET}, inhibited algal growth with {EC}50 values ranging from 0.5\% ({CTR}) and 64\% ({PP}) of the total leachate concentration. Leachates also affected mussel endpoints, including the lysosomal membrane stability and early stages endpoints as gamete fertilization, embryonic development and larvae motility and survival. Embryonic development was the most sensitive parameter in mussels, with {EC}50 values ranging from 0.8\% ({CTR}) to 65\% ({PET}) of the total leachate. The lowest impacts were induced on D-shell larvae survival, reflecting their ability to down-regulate motility and filtration in the presence of chemical stressors. This study provides evidence of the relationship between chemical composition and toxicity of plastic/rubber leachates. Consistent with increasing contamination by organic and inorganic additives, the leachates ranged from slightly to highly toxic to mussels and algae, highlighting the need for a better understanding of the overall impact of plastic-associated chemicals on aquatic ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Due to its widespread use, large amounts of expanded polystyrene ({EPS}) have been released into the marine environment, where it is broken down into small pieces with large surface areas. As such, chemical additives may be released into the environment, which can affect marine organisms; however, studies of the effects of such additives are lacking. We assessed the effects of leachate from {EPS} on the photosynthetic activities of four microalgal species (Dunaliella salina, Scenedesmus rubescens, Chlorella saccharophila, and Stichococcus bacillaris). They were exposed to {EPS} leachate for seven days and their photosynthetic activities were analyzed based on seven parameters. Overall, leachate exposure increased photosynthetic activity in all four species, albeit to different degrees and showing slightly different trends among the seven parameters. Based on chemical analysis, hexabromocyclododecane concentrations were higher in small-fragment leachate, whereas {UV}326 concentrations were higher in low-concentration-large-sphere leachate; bisphenol-A and total organic carbon showed no major differences among leachates. Thus, we speculate that exposure to trace chemicals influenced microalgal photosynthesis and overall growth. These results support further investigation of the impacts of plastic debris and chemical additives on marine ecosystems and organisms.},

In comparison, {IMTA} systems excluding a fed component have received little research. Here we report a field study of an {IMTA} cultivation of the sugar kelp, Saccharina latissima, and the blue mussel, Mytilus edulis, on the Swedish west coast. Kelp were cultivated at two depths, 1-2 m and 3-4 m, either 10 m downstream of commercial scale blue mussel farms, or at control (monoculture) sites at least 500 m from the nearest farm. Significant enhancement of kelp yields in terms of both blade length and biomass was observed in {IMTA} treatments compared to monoculture, with a mean increase in length of 22\% and biomass of 38\%. Moreover, kelps co-cultivated with mussels displayed an epiphyte reduction of more than half compared to kelps grown in monoculture, with a 15\% coverage in monoculture compared to 6\% in co-culture. Significant increases in pigment content were also detected, with higher levels of chlorophyll a, fucoxanthin and phaeophytin in {IMTA} treatment kelps in comparison to monoculture. This study provides evidence for the potential of {IMTA} systems containing solely extractive species and presents factors beyond nutrient enrichment as drivers for enhanced growth in these systems.},

The two most abundant phylotypes are co-localized specifically with the corals' endosymbiotic algae and symbiont-containing host cells.

	abstract = {Assessing the vulnerability of marine invertebrates to ocean acidification ({OA}) requires an understanding of critical thresholds at which developmental, physiological, and behavioral traits are affected. To identify relevant thresholds for echinoderms, we undertook a three-step data synthesis, focused on California Current Ecosystem ({CCE}) species. First, literature characterizing echinoderm responses to {OA} was compiled, creating a dataset comprised of {\textgreater}12,000 datapoints from 41 studies. Analysis of this data set demonstrated responses related to physiology, behavior, growth and development, and increased mortality in the larval and adult stages to low {pH} exposure. Second, statistical analyses were conducted on selected pathways to identify {OA} thresholds specific to duration, taxa, and depth-related life stage. Exposure to reduced {pH} led to impaired responses across a range of physiology, behavior, growth and development, and mortality endpoints for both larval and adult stages. Third, through discussions and synthesis, the expert panel identified a set of eight duration-dependent, life stage, and habitat-dependent {pH} thresholds and assigned each a confidence score based on quantity and agreement of evidence. The thresholds for these effects ranged within {pH} from 7.20 to 7.74 and duration from 7 to 30 days, all of which were characterized with either medium or low confidence. These thresholds yielded a risk range from early warning to lethal impacts, providing the foundation for consistent interpretation of {OA} monitoring data or numerical ocean model simulations to support climate change marine vulnerability assessments and evaluation of ocean management strategies. As a demonstration, two echinoderm thresholds were applied to simulations of a {CCE} numerical model to visualize the effects of current state of {pH} conditions on potential habitat.},

	abstract = {Global climate change is causing ocean acidification ({OA}), warming, and decreased dissolved oxygen ({DO}) in coastal areas, which can cause physiological stress and compromise the health of marine organisms. While there is increased focus on how these stressors will affect marine species, there is little known regarding how changes in water chemistry will impact the bioaccumulation of trace metals. This study compared trace metal concentrations in tissue of Mediterranean mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) and Olympia oysters (Ostrea lurida) in Puget Sound, Washington, a region that experiences naturally low {pH}, seasonal hypoxia, and is surrounded by urbanized and industrialized areas. Shellfish were held at three sites (Carr Inlet, Point Wells, and Dabob Bay) where oceanographic data was continuously collected using mooring buoys. Using inductively coupled plasma mass-spectrometry ({ICP}-{MS}) to measure trace metals in the tissue, we found differences in accumulation of trace metals based on species, location, and shellfish size. Our study found differences between sites in both the mean metal concentrations and variability around the mean of those concentrations in bivalves. However, high metal concentrations in bivalves were not associated with high concentrations of metals in seawater. Metal concentrations in shellfish were associated with size: smaller shellfish had higher concentrations of metals. Carr Inlet at 20 m depth had the smallest shellfish and the highest metal concentrations. While we could not eliminate possible confounding factors, we also found higher metal concentrations in shellfish associated with lower {pH}, lower temperature, and lower dissolved oxygen (conditions seen at Carr Inlet at 20 m and to a lesser extent at Point Wells at 5 m depth). There were also significant differences in accumulation of metals between oysters and mussels, most notably copper and zinc, which were found in higher concentrations in oysters. These findings increase our understanding of spatial differences in trace metal bioaccumulation in shellfish from Puget Sound. Our results can help inform the Puget Sound aquaculture industry how shellfish may be impacted at different sites as climate change progresses and coastal pollution increases.},

Recent findings of mud blisters on the shells of Pacific oysters (Crassostrea gigas Thunberg) in Washington State suggest a new spionid polychaete outbreak. To determine the identity of the polychaete causing these blisters, we obtained Pacific oysters from two locations in Puget Sound and examined them for blisters and burrows caused by polychaete worms. Specimens were also obtained from eastern oysters (Crassostrea virginica Gmelin) collected in New York for morphological and molecular comparison. We compared polychaete morphology to original descriptions, extracted {DNA} and sequenced mitochondrial (cytochrome c oxidase I [{mtCOI}]) and nuclear (small subunit 18S {rRNA} [18S {rRNA}]) genes to determine a species-level molecular identification for these worms. Our data show that Polydora websteri are present in the mud blisters from oysters grown in Puget Sound, constituting the first confirmed record of this species in Washington State.

Despite increasing research efforts, there are still many gaps in our knowledge of how these stressors interact to affect economically and ecologically important species. This project is the first to explore the physiological effects of high {pCO}(2) and temperature on the acclimation potential of the purple-hinge rock scallop (Crassadoma gigantea), a widely distributed marine bivalve, important reef builder, and potential aquaculture product. Scallops were exposed to two {pCO}(2) (365 and 1050 mu atm) and temperature (14 and 21.5 degrees C) conditions in a two-factor experimental design. Simultaneous exposure to high temperature and high {pCO}(2) reduced shell strength, decreased outer shell density and increased total lipid content. Despite identical diets, scallops exposed to high {pCO}(2) had higher content of saturated fatty acids, and lower content of polyunsaturated fatty acids suggesting reorganization of fatty acid chains to sustain basic metabolic functions under high {pCO}(2). Metagenomic sequencing of prokaryotes in scallop tissue revealed treatment differences in community composition between treatments and in the presence of genes associated with microbial cell regulation, signaling, and pigmentation. Results from this research highlight the complexity of physiological responses for calcifying species under global change related stress and provide the first insights for understanding the response of a bivalve's microbiome under multiple stressors.},

	abstract = {Rising atmospheric {CO}2 is expected to increase global temperatures and partial pressure of {CO}2 in surface waters, causing ocean warming and acidification. These changes may have important consequences for the physiological performance of early life-history stages of marine organisms. In this study we investigated the potential for interactive effects of ecologically relevant levels of temperature and {pCO}(2) on germination, dormancy and mortality of zoospores of the giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera, a foundation species of temperate reef ecosystems. Newly settled kelp spores were cultured in the laboratory for seven days in a factorial design with temperature (13 degrees C and 18 degrees C) and {pCO}(2) (similar to 370 and similar to 1800 mu atm) as experimental factors. The two levels of temperature and the low-{pCO}(2) treatment in our design were consistent with present-day environmental conditions in the kelp forest as measured by autonomous temperature and {pH} sensors, while the high-{pCO}(2) treatment reflects an extreme, future acidification scenario. Our results revealed that the combined effects of increased temperature and {pCO}(2) can significantly decrease germination rates and increase the mortality of kelp spores. Interactive effects of temperature and {pCO}(2) were detected,on spore mortality and dormancy. Spore mortality only differed between {pCO}(2) treatments at high temperature. In contrast, spore dormancy was higher in the treatment with low temperature and high {pCO}(2), which is similar to the environmental conditions experienced during upwelling events in southern California. Our results highlight the importance of considering multiple stressors to understand how the early-stages of foundation species such as M pyrifera will be affected by global change.

In the Hawaiian Archipelago, the Leptoseris species complex form the most spatially extensive mesophotic coral ecosystem known and provide habitat for a unique community. To study how the ecophysiology of Leptoseris species relates to symbiont-host specialization and understand the mechanisms responsible for coral energy acquisition in extreme low light environments, we examined Symbiodinium (endosymbiotic dinoflagellate) photobiological characteristics and the lipids and isotopic signatures from Symbiodinium and coral hosts over a depth-dependent light gradient (55-7 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1), 60-132 m). Clear performance differences demonstrate different photoadaptation and photoacclimatization across this genus. Our results also show that flexibility in photoacclimatization depends primarily on Symbiodinium type. Colonies harboring Symbiodinium sp. {COI}-2 showed significant increases in photosynthetic pigment content with increasing depth, whereas colonies harboring Symbiodinium spp. {COI}-1 and {COI}-3 showed variability in pigment composition, yield measurements for photosystem {II}, as well as size and density of Symbiodinium cells. Despite remarkable differences in photosynthetic adaptive strategies, there were no significant differences among lipids of Leptoseris species with depth. Finally, isotopic signatures of both host and Symbiodinium changed with depth, indicating that coral colonies acquired energy from different sources depending on depth. This study highlights the complexity in physiological adaptations within this symbiosis and the different strategies used by closely related mesophotic species to diversify energy acquisition and to successfully establish and compete in extreme light-limited environments.},

Coralline algae are ecosystem engineers that play significant functional roles in oceans worldwide and are considered vulnerable to ocean acidification. Using different stages of coralline algae, we tested the hypothesis that populations living in environments with higher environmental variability and exposed to higher levels of {pCO}(2) would be less affected by high {pCO}(2) than populations from a more stable environment experiencing lower levels of {pCO}(2). Our results show that spores are less sensitive to elevated {pCO}(2) than adults. Spore growth and mortality were not affected by {pCO}(2) level; however, elevated {pCO}(2) negatively impacted the physiology and growth rates of adults, with stronger effects in populations that experienced both lower levels of {pCO}(2) and lower variability in carbonate chemistry, suggesting local adaptation. Differences in physiological plasticity and the potential for adaptation could have important implications for the ecological and evolutionary responses of coralline algae to future environmental changes.},

	abstract = {The variety of Earth’s organisms is manifold. However, it is the small-scale marine community that makes the world goes round. Microbial organisms of pro- and eukaryotic origin drive the carbon supply and nutrient cycling, thus are mediating the primary productivity within the world largest ecosystem called ocean. But due to the ocean’s great size and large number of biogeographically habitats, the total of microbial species can hardly be grabbed and therefore their functional roles not fully described. However, recent advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies are revolutionizing our understanding of the marine microbial diversity, ecology and evolution. Nowadays, research questions on species differentiation can be solved with genomic approaches such as metabarcoding, while transcriptomics offers the possibility to assign gene functions even to a single cell, e.g., single-cell transcriptomics. On the other hand, due to the diversified amount of sequencing data, the certainty of a data crisis is currently evolving. Scientists are forced to broaden their view on bioinformatics resources for analysis and data storage in from of, e.g., cloud services, to ensure the data’s exchangeability. Which is why time resources are now shifting toward solving data problems rather than answering the eco-evolutionary questions stated in the first place. This review is intended to provide exchange on *omics approaches and key points for discussions on data handling used to decipher the relevant diversity and functions of microbial organisms in the marine ecosystem.},

The theory explains the global biogeography of diazotrophs and the observed large-scale variations in surface ocean nutrient concentrations. The ratios in which N, P, and Fe are delivered to the surface ocean, relative to the demands of the phytoplankton community, define several biogeochemical provinces in terms of the limiting nutrients and the presence or absence of diazotrophs. Nutrient supply ratios provided by a global ecosystem model support the theoretical view that diazotroph biogeography is dominated by the Fe : N supply ratio, with the P : N supply ratio taking an important secondary role. The theory yields robust predictions for which strong empirical support is found in global observations of surface nutrient concentrations and diazotroph abundance.},

We identified four P cf. lobata genetic lineages. On Palau’s outer reefs, a thermally sensitive lineage dominates. The Rock Islands harbor two lineages with enhanced thermal tolerance and no consistent growth trade-off. One of these lineages also occurs on several outer reefs. This suggests that the Rock Islands provide naturally tolerant larvae to neighboring areas.

In this work, we compared solid-phase microextraction ({SPME}) to ultrasonic assisted solvent extraction ({UASE}) as sample preparation methods for the liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry ({LC}-{MS}/{MS}) determination of phthalates in ﬁsh ﬁllets. {UASE} was carried out with an acetone-hexane (1:1) solution and according to a reference procedure aimed to obtain the exhaustive extraction of the target analytes. {SPME} was carried out by applying C18 ﬁbers in direct immersion mode and by using water/methanol 20:80 mixture to desorb the aliquot required for the analysis. Overall, {SPME} displayed an improved control of the background contamination and enabled lower {LOQs}. Precision, calculated as relative standard deviation ({RSD}) on replicates of a reference sample, was below 24\% for both the method. Analysis of real samples purchased from Italian supermarkets showed that {SPME} might be an efﬁcient tool for estimating the risk associated with ﬁsh consumption.},

Microalgae, one of the most important primary producers in aquatic ecosystems, could suffer from microplastic contamination, leading to larger impacts on aquatic food webs. Nonetheless, little is known about the toxic effects of microplastics on microalgae populations. Thus, the objective of this review was to identify these effects and the impacts of microplastics on microalgae populations based on currently available literature, also identifying knowledge gaps. Even though microplastics seem to have limited effects on parameters such as growth, chlorophyll content, photosynthesis activity and reactive oxygen species ({ROS}), current environmental concentrations are not expected to induce toxicity. Even so, microplastics could disrupt population regulation mechanisms, by reducing the availability or absorption of nutrients (bottom-up) or reducing the population of predator species (top-down). Microplastics' properties can also inﬂuence the effects on microalgae, with smaller sizes and positive surface charges having higher toxicity. Therefore, more research is needed to better understand the effects of microplastics on microalgae, such as adaptation strategies, effects on population dynamics and microplastics properties inﬂuencing toxicity.},

However, marine plastic pollution is getting increasingly serious due to the large consumption and mismanagement of global plastics. The impact of marine plastics on ecosystem responsible for the gas exchange and circulation of marine {CO}2 may cause more greenhouse gas emissions. Consequently, in this paper, threats of marine microplastics to ocean carbon sequestration are discussed. Marine microplastics can 1) aﬀect phytoplankton photosynthesis and growth; 2) have toxic eﬀects on zooplankton and aﬀect their development and reproduction; 3) aﬀect marine biological pump; and 4) aﬀect ocean carbon stock. Phytoplankton and zooplankton are the most important producer and consumer of the ocean. As such, clearly, further research should be needed to explore the potential scale and scope of this impact, and its underlying mechanisms.},

Results showed that at high plastic concentrations (50 particles/{mL} nominal concentration) the photosynthetic efﬁciency of photosystem {II} in the coral symbiont was affected after 4 weeks of exposure. Both moderate and high (5 and 50 particles/{mL} nominal) concentrations of microplastics caused subtle but signiﬁcant alterations to metabolite proﬁles of coral, as determined by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ({NMR}) spectroscopy. Speciﬁcally, exposed corals were found to have increased levels of phosphorylated sugars and pyrimidine nucleobases that make up nucleotides, scyllo-inositol and a region containing overlapping proline and glutamate signals, compared to control animals. Together with the photo-physiological stress response observed and previously published literature, these ﬁndings support the hypothesis that microplastics disrupt host-symbiont signaling and that corals respond to this interference by increasing signaling and chemical support to the symbiotic zooxanthellae algae. These ﬁndings are also consistent with increased mucus production in corals exposed to microplastics described in previous studies. Considering the importance of coral reefs to marine ecosystems and their sensitivity to anthropogenic stressors, more research is needed to elucidate coral response mechanisms to microplastics under realistic exposure conditions.},

Furthermore, whether {MP} exposure influences coral susceptibility to other stressors such as ocean warming is unknown. Our objective was to determine the physiology response of corals exposed to {MP} concentrations that have been observed in-situ at ambient and elevated temperature that replicates ocean warming. Here, two sets of short-term experiments were conducted at ambient and elevated temperature, exposing the corals Acropora sp. and Seriatopora hystrix to microspheres and microfibres. Throughout the experiments, gross photosynthesis and net respiration was quantified using a 4-chamber coral respirometer, and photosynthetic yields of photosystem {II} were measured using Pulse-Amplitude Modulated ({PAM}) fluorometry. Results indicate the effect of {MP} exposure is dependent on {MP} type, coral species, and temperature. {MP} fibres (but not spheres) reduced photosynthetic capability of Acropora sp., with a 41\% decrease in photochemical efficiency at ambient temperature over 12 days. No additional stress response was observed at elevated temperature; photosynthetic performance significantly increased in Seriatopora hystrix exposed to {MP} spheres. These findings show that a disruption to coral photosynthetic ability can occur at {MP} concentrations that have been observed in the marine environment and that {MP} pollution impact on corals remains an important aspect for further research.},

While bleaching episodes significantly impact shallow waters, little is known about their impact on mesophotic coral communities. We studied the prevalence of coral bleaching two to three months after a heat stress event, along an extreme depth range from 6 to 90 m in French Polynesia. Bayesian modelling showed a decreasing probability of bleaching of all coral genera over depth, with little to no bleaching observed at lower mesophotic depths (greater than or equal to 60 m). We found that depth-generalist corals benefit more from increasing depth than depth-specialists (corals with a narrow depth range). Our data suggest that the reduced prevalence of bleaching with depth, especially from shallow to upper mesophotic depths (40 m), had a stronger relation with the light-irradiance attenuation than temperature. While acknowledging the geographical and temporal variability of the role of mesophotic reefs as spatial refuges during thermal stress, we ought to understand why coral bleaching reduces with depth. Future studies should consider repeated monitoring and detailed ecophysiological and environmental data. Our study demonstrated how increasing depth may offer a level of protection and that lower mesophotic communities could escape the impacts of a thermal bleaching event.},

(clade C) under exposure to 42-nm polystyrene beads. In laboratory experiments, the cell number and aggregation were reduced after 10 days of nanoplastic exposure at 0.01, 0.1, and 10 mg/L concentrations, but no clear correlation with plastic concentration was observed. Genes involved in dynein motor function were upregulated when compared to control conditions, while genes related to photosynthesis, mitosis, and intracellular degradation were downregulated. Overall, nanoplastic exposure led to more genes being downregulated than upregulated and the number of genes with altered expression was larger in Cladocopium sp. than in S. tridacnidorum, suggesting different sensitivity to nano-plastics between species. Our data show that nano-plastic inhibits growth and alters aggregation properties of microalgae, which may negatively affect the uptake of these indispensable symbionts by coral reef organisms.},

              Saccharina latissima
              were studied from February to August 2018 at two kelp farms in Northern (69°45.26′N/019°02.18′E) and in Mid-Norway (63°42.28′N/08°52.23′E). Kelp fronds at each farm were individually followed throughout the growing season. Sectional regression was applied for conversion of measured frond lengths to estimated dry weights. The study shows that between 40 and 100\% of all individuals in the studied kelp population constantly eroded slightly from their distal ends. However, until June the accumulated loss was only 8\% of produced dry weight. Due to dislodgement of whole sporophytes this picture changed in July and August to heavy losses in Mid-Norway. Thus, the overall losses of kelp in terms of accumulated dry weight were only 8–13\% of the gross growth until harvest in June in Mid-Norway and August in Northern Norway. Losses increased significantly in Mid-Norway during July and reached 49.4\% of the annual production in August. The rates of losses were separated into specific erosion and dislodgement rates. Erosion rates over the whole experimental period for the two sites were not significantly different, while differences in dislodgement rates between farm sites proved to be highly significant. The exported annual amount of carbon was estimated on the basis of lost and measured carbon content in the tissue. From these data a scenario was built for a commercial Norwegian kelp farm growing
              S. latissima

              . This is eight times less than has been reported from scenarios for kelp farms in China. This study confirms that optimal timing of harvest is the most important management tool for avoidance of heavy losses from kelp farms. In conclusion, an industry with early harvest will likely have a low carbon export, while a late-harvested bulk production could export four to six times as much carbon with an increased potential for carbon sequestration.},

Here, we use nutrient bioassays to isolate how N (relative to other macronutrients P, Si) regulates {KC} of phytoplankton communities from the Australian coast during summer, when N-availability is often highly variable. {KC} consistently responded to N-amendment, exhibiting up to a threefold reduction and hence an apparent increase in the efﬁciency with which electrons were used to drive C-ﬁxation. However, the process driving this consistent reduction was dependent upon initial conditions. When diatoms dominated assemblages and N was undetectable (e.g., post bloom), {KC} decreased predominantly via a physiological adjustment of the existing community to N-amendment. Conversely, for mixed assemblages, N-addition achieved a similar reduction in {KC} through a change in community structure toward diatom domination. We generate new understanding and parameterization of {KC} that is particularly critical to advance how {FRRf} can be applied to examine C-uptake throughout the global ocean where nitrogen availability is highly variable and thus frequently limits primary productivity.},

	abstract = {The alga Chlamydomonas nivalis thrives in polar snow fields and on high-altitude mountain tops, and contributes significantly on primary production in the polar regions, however, the mechanisms underlying this adaptation to low temperatures are unknown. Here, we compared the growth, photosynthetic activity, membrane lipid peroxidation, and antioxidant activity of C. nivalis with those of the model alga C. reinhardtii, under grow temperature and low temperatures. C. nivalis maintained its photosynthetic activity in these conditions by reducing the light-harvesting ability of photosystem {II} and enhancing the cyclic electron transfer around photosystem I, both of which limited damage to the photosystem from excess light energy and resulted in {ATP} production, supporting cellular growth and other physiological processes. Furthermore, the increased cyclic electron transfer rate, carotenoid content, and antioxidant enzyme activities jointly regulated the reactive oxygen species levels in C. nivalis, enabling recovery from excess excitation energy and reduced photooxidative damage to the cell. Therefore, we propose a model in which adaptive mechanisms related to photosynthetic regulation promote the survival and even blooming of C. nivalis under polar environment, suggesting that C. nivalis can provide organic carbon sources as an important primary producer for other surrounding life in the polar regions for maintaining ecosystem.},

	abstract = {Endocrine disrupting chemicals ({EDC}) are released into environment from different sources. They are mainly used in packaging industries, pesticides and food constituents. Clinical evidence, experimental models, and epidemiological studies suggest that {EDC} have major risks for human by targeting different organs and systems in the body. Multiple mechanisms are involved in targeting the normal system, through estrogen receptors, nuclear receptors and steroidal receptors activation. In this review, different methods by which xenobiotics stimulate signaling pathways and genetic mutation or {DNA} methylation have been discussed. These methods help to understand the results of xenobiotic action on the endocrine system. Endocrine disturbances in the human body result in breast cancer, ovarian problems, thyroid eruptions, testicular carcinoma, Alzheimer disease, schizophrenia, nerve damage and obesity. {EDC} characterize a wide class of compounds such as organochlorinated pesticides, industrial wastes, plastics and plasticizers, fuels and numerous other elements that exist in the environment or are in high use during daily life. The interactions and mechanism of toxicity in relation to human general health problems, especially endocrine disturbances with particular reference to reproductive problems, diabetes, and breast, testicular and ovarian cancers should be deeply investigated. There should also be a focus on public awareness of these {EDC} risks and their use in routine life. Therefore, the aim of this review is to summarize all evidence regarding different physiological disruptions in the body and possible involved mechanisms, to prove the association between endocrine disruptions and human diseases.},

	abstract = {Global habitat deterioration of marine ecosystems has led to a need for active interventions to halt or reverse the loss of ecological function. Restoration has historically been a key tool to reverse habitat loss and restore functions, but the extent to which this will be sufficient under future climates is uncertain. Emerging genetic technologies now provide the ability for restoration to proactively match adaptability of target species to predicted future environmental conditions, which opens up the possibility of boosting resistance to future stress in degraded and threatened habitats. As such, the choice of whether to restore to historical baselines or anticipate the future remains a key decision that will influence restoration success in the face of environmental and climate change. Here, we present an overview of the different motives for restoration – to recover or revive lost or degraded habitats to extant or historical states, or to reinforce or redefine for future conditions. We focus on the genetic and adaptive choices that underpin each option and subsequent consequences for restoration success. These options span a range of possible trajectories, technological advances and societal acceptability, and represent a framework for progressing restoration of marine habitat forming species into the future.},

Management of coral reefs through maintenance (e.g., marine-protected areas, catchment management to improve water quality), restoration, as well as global and national governmental agreements to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (e.g., the 2015 Paris Agreement) is critical for the persistence of coral reefs. Despite these initiatives, the health and abundance of corals reefs are rapidly declining and other solutions will soon be required. We have recently discussed options for using assisted evolution (i.e., selective breeding, assisted gene flow, conditioning or epigenetic programming, and the manipulation of the coral microbiome) as a means to enhance environmental stress tolerance of corals and the success of coral reef restoration efforts. The 2014–2016 global coral bleaching event has sharpened the focus on such interventionist approaches. We highlight the necessity for consideration of alternative (e.g., hybrid) ecosystem states, discuss traits of resilient corals and coral reef ecosystems, and propose a decision tree for incorporating assisted evolution into restoration initiatives to enhance climate resilience of coral reefs.},

Thus, some organisms are exposed to multiple stressors simultaneously, whereas others experience them sequentially. Understanding these physicochemical dynamics is critical because how organisms respond to multiple stressors depends on the magnitude and relative timing of each stressor. Here, we first discuss broad patterns of covariation between stressors in marine systems at various temporal scales. Wethen describe how these dynamics will influence physiological responses to multi-stressor exposures. Finally, we summarize how multi-stressor effects are currently assessed. We find that multi-stressor experiments have rarely incorporated naturalistic physicochemical variation into their designs, and emphasize the importance of doing so to make ecologically relevant inferences about physiological responses to global change.},

            Since the middle of the past century, the Western Antarctic Peninsula has warmed rapidly with a significant loss of sea ice but the impacts on plankton biodiversity and carbon cycling remain an open question. Here, using a 5-year dataset of eukaryotic plankton {DNA} metabarcoding, we assess changes in biodiversity and net community production in this region. Our results show that sea-ice extent is a dominant factor influencing eukaryotic plankton community composition, biodiversity, and net community production. Species richness and evenness decline with an increase in sea surface temperature ({SST}). In regions with low {SST} and shallow mixed layers, the community was dominated by a diverse assemblage of diatoms and dinoflagellates. Conversely, less diverse plankton assemblages were observed in waters with higher {SST} and/or deep mixed layers when sea ice extent was lower. A genetic programming machine-learning model explained up to 80\% of the net community production variability at the Western Antarctic Peninsula. Among the biological explanatory variables, the sea-ice environment associated plankton assemblage is the best predictor of net community production. We conclude that eukaryotic plankton diversity and carbon cycling at the Western Antarctic Peninsula are strongly linked to sea-ice conditions.},

Significant differences (p {\textless} 0.05) in concentration, types, polymer composition, and weathering were found among four compartments. Windward beaches had 1-2 orders of magnitude more plastic pollution (g/m2) than leeward beaches, despite smaller human populations on windward sides. Sea surface and windward beaches were dominated by severely weathered, less dense floating polymers (polyethylene and polypropylene comprised 92.7 and 93.5\% on average, respectively, of the total debris mass), while leeward beaches and the seafloor debris consisted of less weathered and more dense sinking polymers (e.g., 41.0 and 44.7\% of total mass consisted of the sum of polystyrene, nylon, cellulose acetate, polyethylene terephthalate, and additive-masked debris). These results are some of the first to provide evidence of polymeric stratification in the marine environment and emphasize that the majority of marine debris in Hawaii is floating in from distant sources rather than from Hawaii's residents or tourists.},

In the {IC} of bleached corals, 22 proteins were signiﬁcantly more abundant and 17 were signiﬁcantly less abundant compared to the {IC} of non-bleached corals. Gene ontology ({GO}) and pathway analyses revealed metabolic processes that were occurring in bleached corals but not in non-bleached corals. The {OL} of bleached corals used the glyoxylate cycle to derive carbon from internal storage compounds such as lipids, had a high protein turnover rate, and shifted reliance on nitrogen from ammonia to nitrogen produced from the breakdown of urea and betaine. The {IC} of bleached corals compartmentalized the shunting of glucose to the pentose phosphate pathway. Bleached corals increased abundances of several antioxidant proteins in both the {OL} and {IC} compartments compared to non-bleached corals. These results highlight contrasting strategies for responding to bleaching stress in different compartments of bleached M. capitata and shed light on some potential mechanisms behind bleaching resilience.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Biological communities are normally composed of a few abundant and many rare species. This pattern is particularly prominent in microbial communities, in which most constituent taxa are usually extremely rare. Although abundant and rare subcommunities may present intrinsic characteristics that could be crucial for understanding community dynamics and ecosystem functioning, microbiologists normally do not differentiate between them. Here, we investigate abundant and rare subcommunities of marine microbial eukaryotes, a crucial group of organisms that remains among the least-explored biodiversity components of the biosphere. We surveyed surface waters of six separate coastal locations in Europe, independently considering the picoplankton, nanoplankton, and microplankton/mesoplankton organismal size fractions.
{RESULTS}: Deep Illumina sequencing of the 18S {rRNA} indicated that the abundant regional community was mostly structured by organismal size fraction, whereas the rare regional community was mainly structured by geographic origin. However, some abundant and rare taxa presented similar biogeography, pointing to spatiotemporal structure in the rare microeukaryote biosphere. Abundant and rare subcommunities presented regular proportions across samples, indicating similar species-abundance distributions despite taxonomic compositional variation. Several taxa were abundant in one location and rare in other locations, suggesting large oscillations in abundance. The substantial amount of metabolically active lineages found in the rare biosphere suggests that this subcommunity constitutes a diversity reservoir that can respond rapidly to environmental change.
{CONCLUSIONS}: We propose that marine planktonic microeukaryote assemblages incorporate dynamic and metabolically active abundant and rare subcommunities, with contrasting structuring patterns but fairly regular proportions, across space and time.},

              drawdown. Viral lysis and grazing have very different effects on microbial community dynamics and carbon export, yet, very little is known about the relative magnitude and ecological impact of viral lysis on natural phytoplankton communities, especially in Antarctic waters. Here, we report on the temporal dynamics and relative importance of viral lysis rates, in comparison to grazing, for Antarctic nano- and pico-sized phytoplankton of varied taxonomy and size over a full productive season. Our results show that viral lysis was a major loss factor throughout the season, responsible for roughly half (58\%) of seasonal phytoplankton carbon losses. Viral lysis appeared critically important for explaining temporal dynamics and for obtaining a complete seasonal mass balance of Antarctic phytoplankton. Group-specific responses indicated a negative correlation between grazing and viral losses in
              Phaeocystis
              and picoeukaryotes, while for other phytoplankton groups losses were more evenly spread throughout the season. Cryptophyte mortality was dominated by viral lysis, whereas small diatoms were mostly grazed. Larger diatoms dominated algal carbon flow and a single ‘lysis event’ directed {\textgreater}100\% of daily carbon production away from higher trophic levels. This study highlights the need to consider viral lysis of key Antarctic phytoplankton for a better understanding of microbial community interactions and more accurate predictions of organic matter flux in this climate-sensitive region.},

	abstract = {Single species forest systems often suffer from low resistance and resilience to perturbations. Consequently, fostering tree species diversity is discussed as an important management approach to address the impacts of changing climate and disturbance regimes. Yet, the effect of the spatial grain of tree species mixtures remains unknown. We asked whether increasing tree species diversity between stands (beta diversity) has the same effect as increasing tree species diversity within stands (alpha diversity) at similar overall levels of richness (gamma diversity). We conducted a multi-model simulation experiment under climate change, applying two forest landscape models ({iLand} and {LandClim}) across two contrasting landscapes of Central Europe. We analysed the effect of different levels and configurations of diversity on the disturbance impact and the temporal stability of biomass stocks and forest structure. In general, increasing levels of diversity decreased disturbance impacts. Positive diversity effects increased with increasing severity of climate change. Beta diversity buffered disturbance impacts on landscape-level biomass stocks more strongly than alpha diversity. The effects of the spatial configuration on forest structure were more variable. Diversity effects on temporal stability were less pronounced compared to disturbance impacts, and mixture within and between stands had comparable effects on temporal stability. Diversity effects were context-dependent, with patterns varying between landscapes and indicators. Furthermore, we found a strong species identity effect, with increasing diversity being particularly beneficial in conifer-dominated systems of the European Alps. The two models agreed on the effects of different levels and configurations of tree species diversity, underlining the robustness of our findings. Synthesis and application. Enhancing tree species diversity can buffer forest ecosystems against increasing levels of perturbation. Mixing tree species between stands is at least as effective as mixing tree species within stands. Given the managerial advantages of between-stand mixtures (e.g. reduced need to control competition to maintain diversity, higher timber quality, lower logistic effort), we conclude that forest management should consider enhancing diversity at multiple spatial scales. ​},

	abstract = {Background: Reef corals are heterotrophic coelenterates that achieve high productivity through their photosynthetic dinoflagellate symbionts. Excessive seawater temperature destabilises this symbiosis and causes corals to ‘‘bleach,’’ lowering their photosynthetic capacity. Bleaching poses a serious threat to the persistence of coral reefs on a global scale. Despite expanding research on the causes of bleaching, the mechanisms remain a subject of debate.
Methodology/Principal Findings: This study determined how light and food availability modulate the effects of temperature stress on photosynthesis in two reef coral species. We quantified the activities of Photosystem {II}, Photosystem I and whole chain electron transport under combinations of normal and stressful growth temperatures, moderate and high light levels and the presence or absence of feeding of the coral hosts. Our results show that {PS}1 function is comparatively robust against temperature stress in both species, whereas {PS}2 and whole chain electron transport are susceptible to temperature stress. In the symbiotic dinoflagellates of Stylophora pistillata the contents of chlorophyll and major photosynthetic complexes were primarily affected by food availability. In Turbinaria reniformis growth temperature was the dominant influence on the contents of the photosynthetic complexes. In both species feeding the host significantly protected photosynthetic function from high temperature stress.
Conclusions/Significance: Our findings support the photoinhibition model of coral bleaching and demonstrate that {PS}1 is not a major site for thermal damage during bleaching events. Feeding mitigates bleaching in two scleractinian corals, so that reef responses to temperature stresses will likely be influenced by the coinciding availabilities of prey for the host.},

	abstract = {In order to satisfy metabolic requirements for growth, marine cyanobacteria such as Prochlorococcus must acquire cobalt from seawater and synthesize cobalamin cofactors. Through a series of experiments with Prochlorococcus strain {MIT} 9215 under cobalt limiting conditions, the mechanism of Prochlorococcus’ cobalt uptake was investigated. Due to low quotas, Prochlorococcus {MIT} 9215 can maintain growth at extremely slow rates of cobalt uptake, circa 1 atom per cell per hour. Cobalt quotas were linearly related to the concentration of inorganic cobalt species, Co0, indicating that the metal binding sites on the transporter are strongly unsaturated with respect to cobalt. When limited by cobalt, Prochlorococcus growth rates decreased at high levels of both Zn and Mn, suggesting that both metals compete with cobalt for the same transporter. This effect was not observed under a wide range of Fe, Cu, and Ni concentrations, although the onset of exponential growth was delayed at high Ni. These observations agree with prior characterizations of the periplasmic manganese binding protein {MntC}, which is probably the main pathway for inorganic cobalt uptake and the locus for Mn and Zn competitive inhibition. The toxicity of zinc toward cobalt limited Prochlorococcus {MIT} 9215 contrasts with the observation of cobalt-zinc substitution in eukaryotic phytoplankton and is expected to occur at environmentally relevant concentrations of free zinc and cobalt ions. Thus, the ecological success of Prochlorococcus in the modern ocean may depend on access to cobalt complexed by strong organic ligands that are not subject to competitive inhibition by other metals.},

However, the interactive effects of temperature and pathogens on the coral holobiont are poorly understood. Here, we assessed three compartments of the holobiont (host, Symbiodinium and bacterial community) of the coral Montipora aequituberculata challenged with the pathogen Vibrio coralliilyticus and the commensal bacterium Oceanospirillales sp. under ambient (27°C) and elevated (29.5 and 32°C) seawater temperatures. Few visual signs of bleaching and disease development were apparent in any of the treatments, but responses were detected in the holobiont compartments. V. coralliilyticus acted synergistically and negatively impacted the photochemical efficiency of Symbiodinium at 32°C, while Oceanospirillales had no significant effect on photosynthetic efficiency. The coral, however, exhibited a minor response to the bacterial challenges, with the response towards V. coralliilyticus being significantly more pronounced, and involving the prophenoloxidase-activating system and multiple immune system-related genes. Elevated seawater temperatures did not induce shifts in the coral-associated bacterial community, but caused significant gene expression modulation in both Symbiodinium and the coral host. While Symbiodinium exhibited an antiviral response and upregulated stress response genes, M. aequituberculata showed regulation of genes involved in stress and innate immune response processes, including immune and cytokine receptor signalling, the complement system, immune cell activation and phagocytosis, as well as molecular chaperones. These observations show that M. aequituberculata is capable of maintaining a stable bacterial community under elevated seawater temperatures and thereby contributes to preventing disease development.},

This study aimed to isolate and identify potential pathogens associated with {PWPS} utilizing both culture and nonculture screening techniques and inoculation trials. A total of 14 bacterial strains (those dominant in disease lesions, absent or rare in healthy tissues and considered potential pathogens in a previous study) were cultured and used to experimentally inoculate otherwise healthy individuals in an attempt to fulfil Henle?Koch's postulates. However, only one (P180R), identified as closely related (99?100\% sequence identity based on 1.4 kb 16S {RNA} sequence) to Vibrio tubiashii, elicited signs of disease in tank experiments. Following experimental infection (which resulted in a 90\% infection rate), the pathogen was also successfully re-isolated from the diseased tissues and re-inoculated in healthy corals colonies, therefore fulfilling the final stages of Henle?Koch's postulates.

At the Southern Ocean sea ice edge in coastal {McMurdo} Sound, we observed simultaneous cobalamin and iron limitation of surface water phytoplankton communities in late Austral summer. Cobalamin is produced only by bacteria and archaea, suggesting phytoplankton–bacterial interactions must play a role in this limitation. To characterize these interactions and investigate the molecular basis of multiple nutrient limitation, we examined transitions in global gene expression over short time scales, induced by shifts in micronutrient availability. Diatoms, the dominant primary producers, exhibited transcriptional patterns indicative of co-occurring iron and cobalamin deprivation. The major contributor to cobalamin biosynthesis gene expression was a gammaproteobacterial population,
              Oceanospirillaceae
              {ASP}10-02a. This group also contributed significantly to metagenomic cobalamin biosynthesis gene abundance throughout Southern Ocean surface waters.
              Oceanospirillaceae
              {ASP}10-02a displayed elevated expression of organic matter acquisition and cell surface attachment-related genes, consistent with a mutualistic relationship in which they are dependent on phytoplankton growth to fuel cobalamin production. Separate bacterial groups, including
              Methylophaga
              , appeared to rely on phytoplankton for carbon and energy sources, but displayed gene expression patterns consistent with iron and cobalamin deprivation. This suggests they also compete with phytoplankton and are important cobalamin consumers. Expression patterns of siderophore- related genes offer evidence for bacterial influences on iron availability as well. The nature and degree of this episodic colimitation appear to be mediated by a series of phytoplankton–bacterial interactions in both positive and negative feedback loops.},

	abstract = {Diatoms are a dominant group of eukaryotic phytoplankton that contribute substantially to global primary production and the cycling of important elements such as carbon and nitrogen. Heterotrophic bacteria, including members of the gammaproteobacteria, are commonly associated with diatom populations and may rely on them for organic carbon while potentially competing with them for other essential nutrients. Considering that bacterioplankton drive oceanic release of {CO}2 (i.e., bacterial respiration) while diatoms drive ocean carbon sequestration vial the biological pump, the outcome of such competition could inﬂuence the direction and magnitude of carbon ﬂux in the upper ocean. Nitrate availability is commonly a determining factor for the growth of diatom populations, particularly in coastal and upwelling regions. Diatoms as well as many bacterial species can utilize nitrate, however the ability of bacteria to compete for nitrate may be hindered by carbon limitation. Here we have developed a genetically tractable model system using the pennate diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum and the widespread heterotrophic bacteria Alteromonas macleodii to examine carbon-nitrogen dynamics. While subsisting solely on P. tricornutum derived carbon, A. macleodii does not appear to be an effective competitor for nitrate, and may in fact beneﬁt the diatom; particularly in stationary phase. However, allochthonous dissolved organic carbon addition in the form of pyruvate triggers A. macleodii proliferation and nitrate uptake, leading to reduced P. tricornutum growth. Nitrate reductase deﬁcient mutants of A. macleodii ( {nasA}) do not exhibit such explosive growth and associated competitive ability in response to allochthonous carbon when nitrate is the sole nitrogen source, but could survive by utilizing solely P. tricornutum-derived nitrogen. Furthermore, allocthonous carbon addition enables wild-type A. macleodii to rescue nitrate reductase deﬁcient P. tricornutum populations from nitrogen starvation, and {RNA}-seq transcriptomic evidence supports nitrogen-based interactions between diatoms and bacteria at the molecular level. This study provides key insights into the roles of carbon and nitrogen in phytoplankton-bacteria dynamics and lays the foundation for developing a mechanistic understanding of these interactions using co-culturing and genetic manipulation.},

Ideally, the peer review process is an unbiased, fair assessment of the scientific merit and credibility of a study; however, well-documented biases arise in all methods of peer review. Systemic biases have been shown to directly impact the outcomes of peer review, yet little is known about the downstream impacts of unprofessional reviewer comments that are shared with authors. Methods In an anonymous survey of international participants in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics ({STEM}) fields, we investigated the pervasiveness and author perceptions of long-term implications of receiving of unprofessional comments. Specifically, we assessed authors’ perceptions of scientific aptitude, productivity, and career trajectory after receiving an unprofessional peer review. Results We show that survey respondents across four intersecting categories of gender and race/ethnicity received unprofessional peer review comments equally. However, traditionally underrepresented groups in {STEM} fields were most likely to perceive negative impacts on scientific aptitude, productivity, and career advancement after receiving an unprofessional peer review. Discussion Studies show that a negative perception of aptitude leads to lowered self-confidence, short-term disruptions in success and productivity and delays in career advancement. Therefore, our results indicate that unprofessional reviews likely have and will continue to perpetuate the gap in {STEM} fields for traditionally underrepresented groups in the sciences.},

	abstract = {Phthalate esters ({PEs}, Phthalates) are environmentally ubiquitous as a result of their extensive use as plasticizers and additives in diverse consumer products. Considerable concern relates to their reported xenoestrogenicity and consequently, microbial-based attenuation of environmental {PE} concentrations is of interest to combat harmful downstream effects. Fungal {PE} catabolism has received less attention than that by bacteria, and particularly fungi dwelling within aquatic environments remain largely overlooked in this respect. We have compared the biocatalytic and biosorptive removal rates of di-n-butyl phthalate ({DBP}) and diethyl phthalate ({DEP}), chosen to represent two environmentally prominent {PEs} of differing structure and hydrophobicity, by marine-, freshwater-, and terrestrial-derived fungal strains. Bisphenol A, both an extensively used plastic additive and prominent environmental xenoestrogen, was included as a reference compound due to its well-documented fungal degradation. Partial pathways of {DBP} metabolization by the ecophysiologically diverse asco- and basidiomycete strains tested were proposed with the help of {UPLC}-{QTOF}-{MS} analysis. Species specific biochemical reaction steps contributing to {DBP} metabolism were also observed. The involved reactions include initial cytochrome P450-dependent monohydroxylations of {DBP} with subsequent further oxidation of related metabolites, de-esterification via either hydrolytic cleavage or cytochrome P450-dependent oxidative O-dealkylation, transesterification, and demethylation steps - finally yielding phthalic acid as a central intermediate in all pathways. Due to the involvement of ecophysiologically and phylogenetically diverse filamentous and yeast-like fungi native to marine, freshwater, and terrestrial habitats the results of this study outline an environmentally ubiquitous pathway for the biocatalytic breakdown of plastic additives. Beyond previous research into fungal {PE} metabolism which emphasizes hydrolytic de-esterification as the primary catabolic step, a prominent role of cytochrome P450 monooxygenase-catalyzed reactions is established.},

Near coastal cities or other densely populated areas, coral reefs face a range of additional challenges. While considerable progress has been made in understanding coral responses to acute individual stressors (Dominoni et al., 2020), the impacts of chronic exposure to varying combinations of sensory pollutants are largely unknown. To investigate the impacts of urban proximity on corals, we conducted a year-long in-natura study - incorporating sampling at diel, monthly, and seasonal time points – in which we compared corals from an Urban area to corals from a proximal Non-Urban area. Here we reveal that despite appearing relatively healthy, natural biorhythms and environmental sensory systems were extensively disturbed in corals from the Urban environment. Transcriptomic data indicated poor symbiont performance, disturbance to gametogenic cycles, and loss or shifted seasonality of vital biological processes. Altered seasonality patterns were also observed in the microbiomes of the Urban coral population, signifying the impact of urbanization on the holobiont, rather than the coral host alone. These results should raise alarm regarding the largely unknown long-term impacts of sensory pollution on the resilience and survival of coral reefs close to coastal communities},

These assessments, however, often ignore the remainder of the benthos and thus provide limited information on the present-day structure and function of coral reef communities. Here, using an unprecedentedly large dataset collected within the last 10 years across 56 islands spanning five archipelagos in the central Pacific, we examine how benthic reef communities differ in the presence and absence of human populations. Using islands as replicates, we examine whether benthic community structure is associated with human habitation within and among archipelagos and across latitude. While there was no evidence for coral to macroalgal phase shifts across our dataset we did find that the majority of reefs on inhabited islands were dominated by fleshy non-reef-building organisms (turf algae, fleshy macroalgae and non-calcifying invertebrates). By contrast, benthic communities from uninhabited islands were more variable but in general supported more calcifiers and active reef builders (stony corals and crustose coralline algae). Our results suggest that cumulative human impacts across the central Pacific may be causing a reduction in the abundance of reef builders resulting in island scale phase shifts to dominance by fleshy organisms.},

	abstract = {Crustose coralline algae ({CCA}), a group of calcifying red algae found commonly in benthic marine ecosystems worldwide, perform essential ecological functions on coral reefs, including creating benthic substrate, stabilizing the reef structure and inducing coral settlement. An important feature of {CCA} is the ability to keep their surfaces free of epiphytic algae, thereby reducing algal overgrowth and allowing them access to light. However, the mechanisms by which {CCA} prevent settlement of opportunistic seaweeds (fleshy macroalgae) are not fully understood, nor is whether these mechanisms vary among {CCA} species. In our study based on the Great Barrier Reef, we demonstrate that three common {CCA} species (Titanoderma pustulatum, Porolithon onkodes and Neogoniolithon sp.) have a remarkable ability to deter settlement of seaweed spores. We provide experimental evidence that the {CCA} use allelopathy and microbial inhibition against the settlement of spores of the brown seaweed Padina boergesenii. Methanol extracts of allelopathic compounds from T. pustulatum, Po. onkodes and Neogoniolithon sp. significantly reduced the settlement of Pa. boergesenii spores by 4.3 times, 3.0 and 3.8 times, respectively. Further, we found that microbial biofilms, while having a lower inhibitory effect than allelopathic compounds, also reduced seaweed settlement of Pa. boergesenii. Our study demonstrates that allelopathy and microbial inhibition, in addition to epithallial tissue sloughing, are mechanisms employed by {CCA} to prevent the settlement of epiphytic algae. Understanding the mechanisms by which {CCA} avoid seaweed overgrowth contributes to our understanding of the dynamics of seaweed proliferations on reefs and to the ecological knowledge of this important group of reef-building organisms.},

We show experimentally that crustose coralline algae are also capable of suppressing the growth and recruitment potential of an abundant Hawaiian reef macroalga, Ulva fasciata. When mixed communities of crustose coralline algae were absent, relative growth rates of U. fasciata increased by 54.6\%. When experimental nutrient additions were used to induce algal spore release, effective recruitment of U. fasciata approached zero only when crustose coralline algae were present. Mixed communities of crustose coralline algae are thus capable of limiting the local abundance of already-established macroalgae by reducing both their growth rate and recruitment success. This experimental observation was confirmed by field surveys. Because crustose coralline species also induce settlement and metamorphosis in a large number of scleractinian coral species, their abundance and species composition are expected to affect the (future) abundance of macroalgae and corals, which are often used to characterize degraded and ‘healthy’ reefs, respectively.},

	abstract = {Background: Life in the ocean will increasingly have to contend with a complex matrix of concurrent shifts in environmental properties that impact their physiology and control their life histories. Rhodoliths are coralline red algae (Corallinales, Rhodophyta) that are photosynthesizers, calcifiers, and ecosystem engineers and therefore represent important targets for ocean acidification ({OA}) research. Here, we exposed live rhodoliths to near-future {OA} conditions to investigate responses in their photosynthetic capacity, calcium carbonate production, and associated microbiome using carbon uptake, decalcification assays, and whole genome shotgun sequencing metagenomic analysis, respectively. The results from our live rhodolith assays were compared to similar manipulations on dead rhodolith (calcareous skeleton) biofilms and water column microbial communities, thereby enabling the assessment of host-microbiome interaction under climate-driven environmental perturbations. Results: Under high {pCO}(2) conditions, live rhodoliths exhibited positive physiological responses, i.e. increased photosynthetic activity, and no calcium carbonate biomass loss over time. Further, whereas the microbiome associated with live rhodoliths remained stable and resembled a healthy holobiont, the microbial community associated with the water column changed after exposure to elevated {pCO}(2). Conclusions: Our results suggest that a tightly regulated microbial-host interaction, as evidenced by the stability of the rhodolith microbiome recorded here under {OA}-like conditions, is important for host resilience to environmental stress. This study extends the scarce comprehension of microbes associated with rhodolith beds and their reaction to increased {pCO}(2), providing a more comprehensive approach to {OA} studies by assessing the host holobiont.},

              The resilience of coral reefs is dependent on the ability of corals to settle after disturbances. While crustose coralline algae ({CCA}) are considered important substrates for coral settlement, it remains unclear whether coral larvae respond to {CCA} metabolites and microbial cues when selecting sites for attachment and metamorphosis. This study tested the settlement preferences of an abundant coral species (
              Acropora cytherea
              ) against six different {CCA} species from three habitats (exposed, subcryptic and cryptic), and compared these preferences with the metabolome and microbiome characterizing the {CCA}. While all {CCA} species induced settlement, only one species (
              Titanoderma prototypum
              ) significantly promoted settlement on the {CCA} surface, rather than on nearby dead coral or plastic surfaces. This species had a very distinct bacterial community and metabolomic fingerprint. Furthermore, coral settlement rates and the {CCA} microbiome and metabolome were specific to the {CCA} preferred habitat, suggesting that microbes and/or chemicals serve as environmental indicators for coral larvae. Several amplicon sequence variants and two lipid classes—glycoglycerolipids and betaine lipids—present in
              T. prototypum
              were identified as potential omic cues influencing coral settlement. These results support that the distinct microbiome and metabolome of
              T. prototypum
              may promote the settlement and attachment of coral larvae.},

However, coral reefs are becoming increasingly threatened by climate change, overfishing, habitat destruction, and pollution. Historical baselines of coral cover are important to understand how much coral cover has been lost, e.g., to avoid the ‘shifting baseline syndrome’. There are few quantitative observations of coral reef cover prior to the industrial revolution, and therefore baselines of coral reef cover are difficult to estimate. Here, we use expert and ocean-user opinion surveys to estimate baselines of global coral reef cover. The overall mean estimated baseline coral cover was 59\% (±19\% standard deviation), compared to an average of 58\% (±18\% standard deviation) estimated by professional scientists. We did not find evidence of the shifting baseline syndrome, whereby respondents who first observed coral reefs more recently report lower estimates of baseline coral cover. These estimates of historical coral reef baseline cover are important for scientists, policy makers, and managers to understand the extent to which coral reefs have become depleted and to set appropriate recovery targets.},

Stressors such as overfishing and nutrient pollution may reduce resilience of coral reefs by increasing coral–algal competition and reducing coral recruitment, growth and survivorship. Such effects may themselves develop via several mechanisms, including disruption of coral microbiomes. Here we report the results of a 3-year field experiment simulating overfishing and nutrient pollution. These stressors increase turf and macroalgal cover, destabilizing microbiomes, elevating putative pathogen loads, increasing disease more than twofold and increasing mortality up to eightfold. Above-average temperatures exacerbate these effects, further disrupting microbiomes of unhealthy corals and concentrating 80\% of mortality in the warmest seasons. Surprisingly, nutrients also increase bacterial opportunism and mortality in corals bitten by parrotfish, turning normal trophic interactions deadly for corals. Thus, overfishing and nutrient pollution impact reefs down to microbial scales, killing corals by sensitizing them to predation, above-average temperatures and bacterial opportunism.},

	abstract = {Elucidation of the key nutritional requirements for complete larval development of the tropical spiny rock lobster, Panulirus ornatus, presents a major challenge for the development of robust commercial aquaculture for this crustacean. As a foundation study in this area, the chemical composition of early–mid stage P. ornatus phyllosoma (Stages I–{VI}) receiving a novel formulated diet was analysed immediately prior and post-ecdysis to provide insight into the crude nutritional trends during the larval development cycle. From the onset of moulting, cyclical patterns were evident in the proximate composition of phyllosoma, resulting in substantial restructuring between the pre- and post-moult stages of the moult cycle. Proportions of protein, lipid and ash were high at the premoult stage, reﬂecting growth and nutrient accumulation over the intermoult period, and reduced at the post-moult stage, reﬂecting the large uptake of water to facilitate subsequent growth. Polar lipid was the dominant lipid class, accounting for N90\% of the total lipid content. Conversely, triacylglycerol concentrations were low (b5\%), despite being the principal lipid class available in the formulated diet. Likewise, despite receiving high concentrations of eicosapentaenoic acid ({EPA}, 20:5n-3) and docosahexaenoic acid ({DHA}, 22:6n-3) (9.2 and 7.6\% of the dietary lipid source, respectively), levels of these fatty acids were comparatively low in phyllosoma (3.4 and 4.7\%, respectively). In contrast, there is selective deposition of these fatty acids in wild caught phyllosoma. This ﬁnding suggests a poor assimilation of triacylglycerols by captive larvae and highlights the importance of future investigations into alternative sources of {EPA} and {DHA}. Ultimately, this study provides insight into the nutritional requirements of phyllosoma, providing valuable knowledge on diet formulation for commercially viable hatchery production of spiny rock lobsters.},

Therefore, changes in lipid composition reflect changes in the ecology, nutrition, and health of corals. As such, accurate lipid extraction, quantification, and identification is critical to obtain comprehensive insight into a coral’s condition. However, discrepancies exist in sample preparation methodology globally, and it is currently unknown whether these techniques generate analogous results. This study compared the two most common sample preparation techniques for lipid analysis in corals: (1) tissue isolation by air-spraying and (2) crushing the coral in toto. Samples derived from each preparation technique were subsequently analysed to quantify lipids and their constituent classes and fatty acids in four common, scleractinian coral species representing three distinct morphotypes (Acropora millepora, Montipora crassotuberculata, Porites cylindrica, and Pocillopora damicornis). Results revealed substantial amounts of organic material, including lipids, retained in the skeletons of all species following air-spraying, causing a marked underestimation of total lipid concentration using this method. Moreover, lipid class and fatty acid compositions between the denuded skeleton and sprayed tissue were substantially different. In particular, the majority of the total triacylglycerol and total fatty acid concentrations were retained in the skeleton (55–69\% and 56–64\%, respectively). As such, the isolated, sprayed tissue cannot serve as a reliable proxy for lipid quantification or identification in the coral holobiont. The in toto crushing method is therefore recommended for coral sample preparation prior to lipid analysis to capture the lipid profile of the entire holobiont, permitting accurate diagnoses of coral condition.},

Leveraging the inherent ability of reef-building corals to acclimatize to thermal stress via pre-exposure to protective temperature treatments may become an important tool in improving the resilience of coral reefs to rapid environmental change. We investigated whether historical bleaching phenotype, coral host genotype, and exposure to protective temperature treatments would affect the response of the Hawaiian coral Montipora capitata to natural thermal stress. Fragments were collected from colonies that demonstrated different bleaching responses during the 2014–2015 event in Kāne‘ohe Bay (O‘ahu, Hawai‘i) and exposed to four different artificial temperature pre-treatments (and a control at ambient temperature). After recovery, fragments experienced a natural thermal stress event either in laboratory conditions or their native reef environment. Response to thermal stress was quantified by measuring changes in the algal symbionts’ photochemical efficiency, community composition, and relative density. Historical bleaching phenotype was reflected in stable differences in symbiont community composition, with historically bleached corals containing only Cladocopium symbionts and historically non-bleached corals having mixed symbiont communities dominated by Durusdinium. Mixed-community corals lost more Cladocopium than Cladocopium-only corals during the natural thermal stress event and preferentially recovered with Durusdinium. Laboratory pre-treatments exposed corals to more thermal stress than anticipated, causing photochemical damage that varied significantly by genotype. While none of the treatments had a protective effect, temperature variation during treatments had a significant detrimental effect on photochemical efficiency during the thermal stress event. These results show that acclimatization potential is affected by fine-scale differences in temperature regime, host genotype, and relatively stable differences in symbiont community composition that underpin historical bleaching phenotypes in M. capitata.},

Capitalizing on a natural experiment in the equatorial Pacific, we track individual coral colonies at sites spanning a gradient of local anthropogenic disturbance through a tropical heatwave of unprecedented duration. Unexpectedly, some corals survived the event by recovering from bleaching while still at elevated temperatures. These corals initially had heat-sensitive algal symbiont communities, endured bleaching, and then recovered through proliferation of heat-tolerant symbionts. This pathway to survival only occurred in the absence of strong local stressors. In contrast, corals in highly disturbed areas were already dominated by heat-tolerant symbionts, and despite initially resisting bleaching, these corals had no survival advantage in one species and 3.3 times lower survival in the other. These unanticipated connections between disturbance, coral symbioses and heat stress resilience reveal multiple pathways to coral survival through future prolonged heatwaves.},

The present overview highlights the waste management and pollution challenges, emphasising on the various chemical substances (known as “additives”) contained in all plastic products for enhancing polymer properties and prolonging their life.

These additives can potentially migrate and undesirably lead to human exposure via e.g. food contact materials, such as packaging. They can, also, be released from plastics during the various recycling and recovery processes and from the products produced from recyclates.

It is leading to severe increases in sea surface temperatures and in the frequency and magnitude of marine heatwaves. These changing conditions are directly impacting coral reef ecosystems, which are among the most biodiverse ecosystems on Earth. Coral-associated symbionts are particularly affected because summer heatwaves cause coral bleaching—the loss of endosymbiotic microalgae (Symbiodiniaceae) from coral tissues, leading to coral starvation and death. Coral-associated Symbiodiniaceae and bacteria have been extensively studied in the context of climate change, especially in terms of community diversity and dynamics. However, data on other microorganisms and their response to climate change are scarce. Here, we review current knowledge on how increasing temperatures affect understudied coral-associated microorganisms such as archaea, fungi, viruses, and protists other than Symbiodiniaceae, as well as microbe-microbe interactions. We show that the coral-microbe symbiosis equilibrium is at risk under current and predicted future climate change and argue that coral reef conservation initiatives should include microbe-focused approaches.},

	abstract = {The widespread loss of stony reef-building coral populations has been compounded by the low settlement and survival of coral juveniles. To rebuild coral communities, restoration practitioners have developed workflows to settle vulnerable coral larvae in the laboratory and outplant settled juveniles back to natural and artificial reefs. These workflows often make use of natural biochemical settlement cues, which are presented to swimming larvae to induce settlement. This paper establishes the potential for inorganic cues to complement these known biochemical effects. Settlement substrates were fabricated from calcium carbonate, a material present naturally on reefs, and modified with additives including sands, glasses, and alkaline earth carbonates. Experiments with larvae of two Caribbean coral species revealed additive-specific settlement preferences that were independent of bulk surface properties such as mean roughness and wettability. Instead, analyses of the substrates suggest that settling coral larvae can detect localized topographical features more than an order of magnitude smaller than their body width and can sense and positively respond to soluble inorganic minerals such as silica ({SiO}2) and strontianite ({SrCO}3). These findings open a new area of research in coral reef restoration, in which composite substrates can be designed with a combination of natural organic and inorganic additives to increase larval settlement and perhaps also improve post-settlement growth, mineralization, and defense.},

In this work we compared the performance of two extraction methods: pressurized solvent extraction ({PSE}) and density separation. Sea sand and seafloor sediments were spiked with known amounts of polystyrene ({PS}), polyethylene ({PE}) and polypropylene ({PP}) microplastics and submitted to both the extraction procedures. Results showed that the {PSE} ensured higher recoveries for the smaller size particle fractions (89,2 ± 1.1\% in the 50–150 μm range) whereas the density separation enabled precise recoveries for the larger size particles ({SD} = 1,5\%).

	abstract = {The success of tropical scleractinian corals depends on their ability to establish symbioses with microbial partners. Host phylogeny and traits are known to shape the coral microbiome, but to what extent they affect its composition remains unclear. Here, by using 12 coral species representing the complex and robust clades, we explored the inﬂuence of host phylogeny, skeletal architecture, and reproductive mode on the microbiome composition, and further investigated the structure of the tissue and skeleton bacterial communities. Our results show that host phylogeny and traits explained 14\% of the tissue and 13\% of the skeletal microbiome composition, providing evidence that these predictors contributed to shaping the holobiont in terms of presence and relative abundance of bacterial symbionts. Based on our data, we conclude that host phylogeny affects the presence of speciﬁc microbial lineages, reproductive mode predictably inﬂuences the microbiome composition, and skeletal architecture works like a ﬁlter that affects bacterial relative abundance. We show that the b-diversity of coral tissue and skeleton microbiomes differed, but we found that a large overlapping fraction of bacterial sequences were recovered from both anatomical compartments, supporting the hypothesis that the skeleton can function as a microbial reservoir. Additionally, our analysis of the microbiome structure shows that 99.6\% of tissue and 99.7\% of skeletal amplicon sequence variants ({ASVs}) were not consistently present in at least 30\% of the samples, suggesting that the coral tissue and skeleton are dominated by rare bacteria. Together, these results provide novel insights into the processes driving coral-bacterial symbioses, along with an improved understanding of the scleractinian microbiome.},

As the phthalate plasticizers are not chemically bound to {PVC}, they can leach, migrate or evaporate into indoor air and atmosphere, foodstuff, other materials, etc. Consumer products containing phthalates can result in human exposure through direct contact and use, indirectly through leaching into other products, or general environmental contamination. Humans are exposed through ingestion, inhalation, and dermal exposure during their whole lifetime, including intrauterine development. This paper presents an overview on current risk assessments done by expert panels as well as on exposure assessment data, based on ambient and on current human biomonitoring results. Some phthalates are reproductive and developmental toxicants in animals and suspected endocrine disruptors in humans. Exposure assessment via modelling ambient data give hints that the exposure of children to phthalates exceeds that in adults. Current human biomonitoring data prove that the tolerable intake of children is exceeded to a considerable degree, in some instances up to 20-fold. Very high exposures to phthalates can occur via medical treatment, i.e. via use of medical devices containing {DEHP} or medicaments containing {DBP} phthalate in their coating. Because of their chemical properties exposure to phthalates does not result in bioaccumulation. However, health concern is raised regarding the developmental and/or reproductive toxicity of phthalates, even in environmental concentrations.},

	abstract = {Coral bleaching events are increasing in frequency, demanding examination of the physiological and molecular responses of scleractinian corals and their algal symbionts (Symbiodinium sp.) to stressors associated with bleaching. Here, we quantify the effects of long-term (95-day) thermal and {CO}2-acidification stress on photochemical efficiency of in hospite Symbiodinium within the coral Siderastrea siderea, along with corresponding coral color intensity, for corals from two reef zones (forereef, nearshore) on the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System. We then explore the molecular responses of in hospite Symbiodinium to these stressors via genome-wide gene expression profiling. Elevated temperatures reduced symbiont photochemical efficiencies and were highly correlated with coral color loss. However, photochemical efficiencies of forereef symbionts were more negatively affected by thermal stress than nearshore symbionts, suggesting greater thermal tolerance and/or reduced photodamage in nearshore corals. At control temperatures, {CO}2-acidification had little effect on symbiont physiology, although forereef symbionts exhibited constitutively higher photochemical efficiencies than nearshore symbionts. Gene expression profiling revealed that S. siderea were dominated by Symbiodinium goreaui (C1), except under thermal stress, which caused shifts to thermotolerant Symbiodinium trenchii (D1a). Comparative transcriptomics of conserved genes across the host and symbiont revealed few differentially expressed S. goreaui genes when compared to S. siderea, highlighting the host's role in the coral's response to environmental stress. Although S. goreaui transcriptomes did not vary in response to acidification stress, their gene expression was strongly dependent on reef zone, with forereef S. goreaui exhibiting enrichment of genes associated with photosynthesis. This finding, coupled with constitutively higher forereef S. goreaui photochemical efficiencies, suggests that functional differences in genes associated with primary production exist between reef zones.},

There is evidence of microplastic ingestion by corals and passive contact with coral tissues, causing adverse health effects that include energy expenditure for particle removal from the tissue surface, as well as reduced growth, tissue bleaching, and necrosis. Here, it was examined whether microplastic contamination impairs the success of gamete fertilisation, embryo development and larval settlement of the reef-building coral Acropora tenuis. Coral gametes and larvae were exposed to fifteen microplastic treatments using two types of plastic: (1) weathered polypropylene particles and (2) spherical polyethylene microbeads. The treatments ranged from five to 50 polypropylene pieces L−1 and 25 to 200 microbeads L−1. Fertilisation was only negatively affected by the largest weathered microplastics (2 mm2), but the effects were not dose dependent. Embryo development and larval settlement were not significantly impacted by either microplastic type. The study shows that moderate–high levels of marine microplastic contamination, specifically particles {\textless}2 mm2, will not substantially interfere with the success of critical early life coral processes.},

Method recoveries were between 87 and 83\% and limits of quantitation ({LOQs}) were between 6.6 and 30.2 ng/g. Analyses showed that 70\% of the sponges presented plastic contamination, with an average of 1.2 particles/g tissue for the 25–150 μm size range, and a total plastic concentration of up to 4.8 μg/g in the 0.2–25 μm size range, with polyoleﬁn being the most represented polymer in both size ranges.

	abstract = {Here we describe an efficient and effective technique for rearing sexually-derived coral propagules from spawning through larval settlement and symbiont uptake with minimal impact on natural coral populations. We sought to maximize larval survival while minimizing expense and daily husbandry maintenance by experimentally determining optimized conditions and protocols for gamete fertilization, larval cultivation, induction of larval settlement by crustose coralline algae, and inoculation of newly settled juveniles with their dinoflagellate symbiont Symbiodinium. Larval rearing densities at or below 0.2 larvae {mL}−1 were found to maximize larval survival and settlement success in culture tanks while minimizing maintenance effort. Induction of larval settlement via the addition of a ground mixture of diverse crustose coralline algae ({CCA}) is recommended, given the challenging nature of in situ {CCA} identification and our finding that non settlement-inducing {CCA} assemblages do not inhibit larval settlement if suitable assemblages are present. Although order of magnitude differences in infectivity were found between common Great Barrier Reef Symbiodinium clades C and D, no significant differences in Symbiodinium uptake were observed between laboratory-cultured and wild-harvested symbionts in each case. The technique presented here for Acropora millepora can be adapted for research and restoration efforts in a wide range of broadcast spawning coral species.},

	abstract = {Different fluorescence-based parameters are described in the literature for the quantum yields of non-photochemical energy conversion in {PS} {II}, φ{NPQ} and φ{NO}, which are complementary with the quantum yield of photochemical energy conversion, φ{II}. With modern {PAM} fluorometers, like the Dual-{PAM}-100, these quantum yields are calculated online with every Saturation Pulse and displayed as the parameters Y({II}), Y({NPQ}) and Y({NO}), the sum of which is always unity: Y({II}) + Y({NPQ}) +Y({NO}) = 1. These quantum yields comprehensively describe the fate of excitation energy in {PS} {II} and allow deep insights into the plant's capacity to cope with excess excitation energy. While so far calculation of Y({NPQ}) and Y({NO}) by the {PAM} software has been based on rather complex expressions derived by Kramer et al. (2004) Photosynth Res 79: 209-218, more simple expressions derived by Genty et al. (1996) (abstract no P28 of Robert Hill Symposium, Sheffield, {UK}) were advocated by Hendrickson et al. (2004) Photosynth Res 82: 73-81, with Y({NO}) and Y({NPQ}) being expressed by the fluorescence yields F, Fm and Fm', measured by {PAM} fluorometry and the Saturation Pulse method: Y({NO}) = F/Fm and Y({NPQ}) = F/Fm' - F/Fm. Notably these expressions do not require knowledge of Fo'. Here we show that the expressions of Kramer et al. (2004) can be transformed into the simple expressions of Genty et al. (1996) and that these are not only valid for a lake model, but also for a puddle model, as already known for Y({II}) = (Fm'-F)/Fm'. The meaning of Y({NO}) is discussed and an example of characteristic changes of the complementary {PS} {II} quantum yields after heat-pretreatment is presented.},

To address these gaps, we assessed the toxicity of micro (1–20 µm) and nano ({\textless}1 µm) {TPs} for two model organisms, embryonic Zebrafish Danio rerio and the crustacean Daphnia magna. To assess effects on development, Zebrafish embryos were exposed to concentrations of {TPs} or leachate ranging from 0 to 3.0 × 109 particles/ml and 0–100\% respectively (n = 4). Greater mortality and sublethal malformations were observed following nano {TP} and leachate exposures as compared to micro {TPs}. Unique abnormalities between the exposures indicates that there is both chemical and particle-specific toxicity. We also observed D. magna mortality following a 48 h exposure of neonate to {TPs} or leachate, ranging from 0 to 3.3 × 109 particles/ml and 0–100\% respectively (n = 3). Though, particleenhancement of toxicity was observed for both Zebrafish and D. magna, overall sensitivity to {TPs} differed. It is important to identify differential toxicities across species to achieve an understanding of the environmental impacts of {TPs} and the chemicals they leach.},

Bleaching may result from evolutionary conflict between the host corals and their symbionts. Selection at the level of the individual symbiont favors using the products of photosynthesis for selfish replication, while selection at the higher level favors using these products for growth of the entire host/symbiont community. To hold the selfish lower-level units in check, mechanisms of conflict mediation must evolve. Fundamental features of photosynthesis have been co-opted into conflict mediation so that symbionts that fail to export these products produce high levels of reactive oxygen species and undergo programmed cell death. These mechanisms function very well under most environmental conditions, but under conditions particularly detrimental to photosynthesis, it is these mechanisms of conflict mediation that trigger bleaching.},

	abstract = {The symbiotic association between the coral animal and its endosymbiotic dinoflagellate partner Symbiodinium is central to the success of corals. However, an array of other microorganisms associated with coral (i.e., Bacteria, Archaea, Fungi, and viruses) have a complex and intricate role in maintaining homeostasis between corals and Symbiodinium. Corals are sensitive to shifts in the surrounding environmental conditions. One of the most widely reported responses of coral to stressful environmental conditions is bleaching. During this event, corals expel Symbiodinium cells from their gastrodermal tissues upon experiencing extended seawater temperatures above their thermal threshold. An array of other environmental stressors can also destabilize the coral microbiome, resulting in compromised health of the host, which may include disease and mortality in the worst scenario. However, the exact mechanisms by which the coral microbiome supports coral health and increases resilience are poorly understood. Earlier studies of coral microbiology proposed a coral probiotic hypothesis, wherein a dynamic relationship exists between corals and their symbiotic microorganisms, selecting for the coral holobiont that is best suited for the prevailing environmental conditions. Here, we discuss the microbial-host relationships within the coral holobiont, along with their potential roles in maintaining coral health. We propose the term {BMC} (Beneficial Microorganisms for Corals) to define (specific) symbionts that promote coral health. This term and concept are analogous to the term Plant Growth Promoting Rhizosphere ({PGPR}), which has been widely explored and manipulated in the agricultural industry for microorganisms that inhabit the rhizosphere and directly or indirectly promote plant growth and development through the production of regulatory signals, antibiotics and nutrients. Additionally, we propose and discuss the potential mechanisms of the effects of {BMC} on corals, suggesting strategies for the use of this knowledge to manipulate the microbiome, reversing dysbiosis to restore and protect coral reefs. This may include developing and using {BMC} consortia as environmental “probiotics” to improve coral resistance after bleaching events and/or the use of {BMC} with other strategies such as human-assisted acclimation/adaption to shifting environmental conditions.},

Concordant phylogenetic and population genetic evidence clearly differentiate separately evolving, reproductively isolated lineages. We describe Symbiodinium boreum sp. nov. and S. eurythalpos sp. nov., two symbionts known to occur in colonies of the zebra coral, Oulastrea crispata (Scleractinia), which lives in turbid, marginal habitats extending from equatorial Southeast Asia to the main islands of Japan in the temperate northwest Pacific Ocean. Symbiodinium boreum was associated with O. crispata in temperate latitudes and S. eurythalpos was common to colonies in the tropics. The geographical ranges of both symbiont species overlapped in the subtropics where they sometimes co-occurred in the same host colony. Symbiodinium trenchii sp. nov. is also described. As a host-generalist symbiont, it often occurs in symbiosis with various species of Scleractinia possessing open (horizontal) modes of symbiont acquisition and is common to reef coral communities thriving in warm turbid reef habitats in the western Pacific Ocean, Indian Ocean, Arabian/Persian Gulf, Red Sea and western Atlantic (Caribbean). As is typical for dinoflagellates, S. boreum and S. eurythalpos were haploid, but microsatellite loci from field-collected and cultured S. trenchii often possessed two alleles, implying that a genome-wide duplication occurred during the evolution of this species. The recognition that Clade D Symbiodinium contains species exhibiting marked differences in host specificity and geographical distribution will yield greater scientific clarity about how stress-tolerant symbionts function in the ecological response of coral–dinoflagellate symbioses to global climate change.},

The method combines a simple, inexpensive, and solvent-less sample preparation technique with the specificity and speed of {DESI}-{MS} and {MS}/{MS}. Extraction of seven drugs from raw urine is performed using specially designed {SPME} fibers coated uniformly with silica-C(18) stationary phase. Each {SPME} device is inserted into unprocessed urine under gentle agitation and, then, removed, rinsed, and analyzed directly by {DESI}-{MS} ({MS}/{MS}). Rapid screening over a wide mass range is afforded by coupling the method with a time of flight ({TOF}) mass spectrometer while quantitative analysis is performed using selected reaction monitoring ({SRM}) using a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. The performance of the {SPME} {DESI}-{MS}/{MS} method was evaluated by preparing calibration standards and quality control ({QC}) samples of the seven drug compounds from urine over a range from 20 to 1000 ng/{mL}, with the exception of meprobamate which was prepared from 200 to 10000 ng/{mL}. The calibration curves constructed for each analyte had an R(2) {\textgreater} 0.99. The range of precision (\%{CV}) and accuracy values (\% bias) for low {QC} samples was 1-11\% and 3-38\%, respectively. Precision and accuracy values for high {QC} samples range from 0.9 to 8\% and -31 to -8\%. Results from urine specimens of actual exposure to drugs screened using the {SPME} {DESI}-{MS}/{MS} method showed good agreement with the conventional immunoassays and {GC}/{MS} analysis. Liquid desorption of the {SPME} fiber followed by {LC}/{MS}/{MS} also showed good agreement with the {SPME} {DESI}-{MS}/{MS} method.},

	abstract = {Global seaweed carbon sequestration estimates are currently taken as the fraction of the net primary production ({NPP}) exported to the deep ocean. However, this perspective does not account for {CO}2 from the consumption of external subsidies. Here, we clarify: (i) the role of export relative to seaweed net ecosystem production ({NEP}) for a closed system and one more likely open to subsidies; (ii) the importance of subsidies by compiling published estimates of {NEP} from seaweed-dominated ecosystems; and (iii) discuss their impact on the global seaweed net carbon balance and other sequestration constraints as a mitigation service. Examples of seaweed {NEP} (n = 18) were sparse and variable. Nevertheless, the average {NEP} (−4.0 mmol C m–2 d–1 {SE} ± 12.2) suggested that seaweed ecosystems are a C source, becoming increasingly heterotrophic as their export is consumed. Critically, mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions was mixed relative to their replacement or baseline states, and where {CO}2 is supplied independently of organic metabolism and atmospheric exchange, we caution a sole reliance on {NEP} or {NPP}. This will ensure a more accurate seaweed mitigation assessment, one that does exceed their capacity and is effective within a compliance and carbon trading scheme.},

	abstract = {Green fluorescent protein ({GFP})-like pigments are responsible for the vivid colouration of many reef-building corals and have been proposed to act as photoprotectants. Their role remains controversial because the functional mechanism has not been elucidated. We provide direct evidence to support a photoprotective role of the non-fluorescent chromoproteins ({CPs}) that form a biochemically and photophysically distinct group of {GFP}-like proteins. Based on observations of Acropora nobilis from the Great Barrier Reef, we explored the photoprotective role of {CPs} by analysing five coral species under controlled conditions. In vitro and in hospite analyses of chlorophyll excitation demonstrate that screening by {CPs} leads to a reduction in chlorophyll excitation corresponding to the spectral properties of the specific {CPs} present in the coral tissues. Between 562 and 586 nm, the {CPs} maximal absorption range, there was an up to 50 \% reduction of chlorophyll excitation. The screening was consistent for established and regenerating tissue and amongst symbiont clades A, C and D. Moreover, among two differently pigmented morphs of Acropora valida grown under identical light conditions and hosting subclade type C3 symbionts, high {CP} expression correlated with reduced photodamage under acute light stress.},

This paper represents the first study to determine the spatial and temporal trends of floating macro debris quantities and polymer composition within Maui County waters. Ocean surveys were conducted from 2013 to 2017 and collected 2095 debris items of which 90\% were plastic. Attempts to categorize items by source resulted in only 6\% likely from land, 12\% from ocean-based sources, 50\% from either land or ocean, and 32\% from unknown sources. Results found a multi-step process for debris accumulation, with temporal trends linked to survey day and year and spatial trends linked to ocean processes. High- and low-density polyethylene and polypropylene accounted for the majority of polymer types. The results of this study demonstrate minimal debris in Maui originates from land/local sources, and the importance of baseline data to guide further research and mitigation measures.},

	abstract = {Because of their widespread application, phthalates or phthalic acid esters ({PAEs}) are ubiquitous in the environment. Their presence has attracted considerable attention due to their potential impacts on ecosystem functioning and on public health, so their quantification has become a necessity. Various extraction procedures as well as gas/liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry detection techniques are found as suitable for reliable detection of such compounds. However, {PAEs} are ubiquitous in the laboratory environment including ambient air, reagents, sampling equipment, and various analytical devices, that induces difficult analysis of real samples with a low {PAE} background. Therefore, accurate {PAE} analysis in environmental matrices is a challenging task. This paper reviews the extensive literature data on the techniques for {PAE} quantification in natural media. Sampling, sample extraction/pretreatment and detection for quantifying {PAEs} in different environmental matrices (air, water, sludge, sediment and soil) have been reviewed and compared. The concept of "green analytical chemistry" for {PAE} determination is also discussed. Moreover useful information about the material preparation and the procedures of quality control and quality assurance are presented to overcome the problem of sample contamination and these encountered due to matrix effects in order to avoid overestimating {PAE} concentrations in the environment.},

	abstract = {Marine ecosystems involve relationships between genomic interactions of marine populations with shared biogeographic ranges and the environmental conditions. These relationships, studied mainly through neutral {DNA} markers, are not always consistent with actual biogeographic patterns or the evolutionary history of marine species. In addition, increased information at functional genomic level from non-model species allows the study of adaptive responses in marine populations. This work reports local transcriptomic patterns in populations of the mussel Mytilus chilensis and their correspondence with oceanographic variability in southern Chile. Analysis of gene expression patterns was conducted through {qPCR} of seven candidate genes involved in the response to environmental stress ({HSP}70, {HSP}90), iron metabolism (Ferritin), pathogens (Mytilin B, Defensin) and oxidative stress ({SOD}-{CuZn}, Catalase) in at five study sites located in southern Chile, from Valdivia (39°56′S–73°36′W) to Melinka (43°52′S–73°44′W). Multivariate and correlation analyses were used to assess the relationship between levels of individual gene expression and site features characterized using satellite data on surface temperature, chlorophyll concentration and total suspended sediments. Two main groups of sites with differential patterns of gene expression were identified. Individuals exposed to higher temperatures showed an overexpression of {HSP}70, {HSP}90 and Ferritin genes. The expression of {SOD}-{CuZn} and Catalase was correlated with local chlorophyll-a (i.e. food availability for mussels), although with opposite correlations. In addition, Mytilin B showed higher levels of expression in areas with higher freshwater influence. Patterns of gene expression across the region of interest suggest that spatial variability in environmental conditions induce phenotypic changes in different populations of the same mussel species. In addition, the analysis of expression patterns in candidate genes can reveal local patterns in populations where other molecular markers show no genetic structure.},

	abstract = {Ocean warming ({OW}) and acidification ({OA}) are two of the greatest global threats to the persistence of coral reefs. Calcifying reef taxa such as corals and coralline algae provide the essential substrate and habitat in tropical reefs but are at particular risk due to their susceptibility to both {OW} and {OA}. {OW} poses the greater threat to future reef growth and function, via its capacity to destabilise the productivity of both taxa, and to cause mass bleaching events and mortality of corals. Marine heatwaves are projected to increase in frequency, intensity, and duration over the coming decades, raising the question of whether coral reefs will be able to persist as functioning ecosystems and in what form. {OA} should not be overlooked, as its negative impacts on the calcification of reef-building corals and coralline algae will have consequences for global reef accretion. Given that {OA} can have negative impacts on the reproduction and early life stages of both coralline algae and corals, the interdependence of these taxa may result in negative feedbacks for reef replenishment. However, there is little evidence that {OA} causes coral bleaching or exacerbates the effects of {OW} on coral bleaching. Instead, there is some evidence that {OA} alters the photo-physiology of both taxa. Tropical coralline algal possess shorter generation times than corals, which could enable more rapid evolutionary responses. Future reefs will be dominated by taxa with shorter generation times and high plasticity, or those individuals inherently resistant and resilient to both marine heatwaves and {OA}.},

	abstract = {Many commercial plasticizers are toxic endocrinedisrupting chemicals that are added to plastics during manufacturing and may leach out once they reach the environment. Traditional phthalic acid ester plasticizers ({PAEs}), such as dibutyl phthalate ({DBP}) and bis(2-ethyl hexyl) phthalate ({DEHP}), are now increasingly being replaced with more environmentally friendly alternatives, such as acetyl tributyl citrate ({ATBC}). While the metabolic pathways for {PAE} degradation have been established in the terrestrial environment, to our knowledge, the mechanisms for {ATBC} biodegradation have not been identiﬁed previously and plasticizer degradation in the marine environment remains underexplored. From marine plastic debris, we enriched and isolated microbes able to grow using a range of plasticizers and, for the ﬁrst time, identiﬁed the pathways used by two phylogenetically distinct bacteria to degrade three diﬀerent plasticizers (i.e., {DBP}, {DEHP}, and {ATBC}) via a comprehensive proteogenomic and metabolomic approach. This integrated multi-{OMIC} study also revealed the diﬀerent mechanisms used for ester side-chain removal from the diﬀerent plasticizers (esterases and enzymes involved in the β-oxidation pathway) as well as the molecular response to deal with toxic intermediates, that is, phthalate, and the lower biodegrading potential detected for {ATBC} than for {PAE} plasticizers. This study highlights the metabolic potential that exists in the bioﬁlms that colonize plasticsthe Plastisphereto eﬀectively biodegrade plastic additives and ﬂags the inherent importance of microbes in reducing plastic toxicity in the environment.},

	abstract = {Elevated temperatures and nutrients are degrading coral reef ecosystems, but the understanding of how early life stages of reef corals respond to these stressors remains limited. Here, we test the impact of temperature (mean {\textasciitilde} 27 °C vs. {\textasciitilde} 29 °C) and nitrate and phosphate enrichment (ambient, + 5 µM nitrate, + 1 µM phosphate and combined + 5 µM nitrate with 1 µM phosphate) on coral larvae using three Hawaiian coral species with different modes of symbiont transmission and reproduction: Lobactis scutaria (horizontal, gonochoric broadcast spawner), Pocillopora acuta (vertical, hermaphroditic brooder) and Montipora capitata (vertical, hermaphroditic broadcast spawner). Temperature and nutrient effects were species specific and appear antagonistic for L. scutaria and M. capitata, but not for P. acuta. Larvae survivorship in all species was lowest under nitrate enrichment at 27 °C. M. capitata and L. scutaria survivorship increased at 29 °C. However, positive effects of warming on survivorship were lost under high nitrate, but phosphate attenuated nitrate effects when N/P ratios were balanced. P. acuta larvae exhibited high survivorship ({\textgreater} 91\%) in all treatments and showed little change in larval size, but lower respiration rates at 29 °C. Elevated nutrients (+N+P) led to the greatest loss in larvae size for aposymbiotic L. scutaria, while positive growth in symbiotic M. capitata larvae was reduced under warming and highest in +N+P treatments. Overall, we report a greater sensitivity of broadcast spawners to warming and nutrient changes compared to a brooding coral species. These results suggest variability in biological responses to warming and nutrient enrichment is influenced by life-history traits, including the presence of symbionts (vertical transmission), in addition to nutrient type and nutrient stoichiometry.},

	abstract = {Crustose coralline algae ({CCA}) are key reef-building primary producers that are known to induce the metamorphosis and recruitment of many species of coral larvae. Reef biofilms (particularly microorganisms associated with {CCA}) are also important as settlement cues for a variety of marine invertebrates, including corals. If rising sea surface temperatures ({SSTs}) affect {CCA} and/or their associated biofilms, this may in turn affect recruitment on coral reefs. Herein, we report that the {CCA} Neogoniolithon fosliei, and its associated microbial communities do not tolerate {SSTs} of 32 °C, only 2–4 °C above the mean maximum annual {SST}. After 7 days at 32 °C, the {CCA} exhibited clear signs of stress, including bleaching, a reduction in maximum quantum yield (Fv/Fm) and a large shift in microbial community structure. This shift at 32 °C involved an increase in Bacteroidetes and a reduction in Alphaproteobacteria, including the loss of the primary strain (with high-sequence similarity to a described coral symbiont). A recovery in Fv/Fm was observed in {CCA} exposed to 31 °C following 7 days of recovery (at 27 °C); however, {CCA} exposed to 32 °C did not recover during this time as evidenced by the rapid growth of endolithic green algae. A 50\% reduction in the ability of N. fosliei to induce coral larval metamorphosis at 32 °C accompanied the changes in microbiology, pigmentation and photophysiology of the {CCA}. This is the first experimental evidence to demonstrate how thermal stress influences microbial associations on {CCA} with subsequent downstream impacts on coral recruitment, which is critical for reef regeneration and recovery from climate-related mortality events.},

	abstract = {Crustose coralline algae ({CCA}) are critical members of the coral reef ecosystem, yet they remain poorly studied. Recent research on {CCA} has shown that only a few species play a significant role in the settlement of coral larvae through either the production of chemical settlement cues or the facilitation of specific microbial communities that are hypothesized to influence coral settlement. Thus, defining how {DOM} exudates differ between {CCA} species and the bacterioplankton communities these exudates facilitate is important for understanding the role of {CCA} in invertebrate settlement. We conducted single day exudation experiments on two species of {CCA} to compare tissue microbiome community structure, {DOM} production and the effect of {DOM} on the bacterioplankton community. We collected exudates from Hydrolithon reinboldii and Porolithon onkodes in both filter-sterilized seawater and unfiltered seawater from Kāne‘ohe Bay, Hawai‘i. Our results demonstrate that while both species exude equivalent quantities of dissolved organic carbon they differ in the composition of fluorescent {DOM} and fostered distinct microbial communities. P. onkodes exudates facilitate more microbial {OTUs} associated with coral disease, whereas H. reinboldii facilitated {OTUs} known to produce antimicrobial compounds. Our results highlight species-specific differences in the composition of {fDOM} exudates of {CCA} and the effect of those on microbial community structure.},

Shotgun metagenomic {DNA} sequencing is a relatively new and powerful environmental sequencing approach that provides insight into community biodiversity and function. But, the analysis of metagenomic sequences is complicated due to the complex structure of the data. Fortunately, new tools and data resources have been developed to circumvent these complexities and allow researchers to determine which microbes are present in the community and what they might be doing. This review describes the analytical strategies and specific tools that can be applied to metagenomic data and the considerations and caveats associated with their use. Specifically, it documents how metagenomes can be analyzed to quantify community structure and diversity, assemble novel genomes, identify new taxa and genes, and determine which metabolic pathways are encoded in the community. It also discusses several methods that can be used compare metagenomes to identify taxa and functions that differentiate communities.},

Under conditions expected in the 21st century, global warming and ocean acidification will compromise carbonate accretion, with corals becoming increasingly rare on reef systems. The result will be less diverse reef communities and carbonate reef structures that fail to be maintained. Climate change also exacerbates local stresses from declining water quality and overexploitation of key species, driving reefs increasingly toward the tipping point for functional collapse. This review presents future scenarios for coral reefs that predict increasingly serious consequences for reef-associated fisheries, tourism, coastal protection, and people.

These algae play critical ecological roles including being key to a range of invertebrate recruitment processes, functioning as autogenic ecosystem engineers through provision of three-dimensional habitat structure, as well as contributing critical structural strength in coral reef ecosystems. Calcified macroalgae contribute significantly to the deposition of carbonates in coastal environments. These organisms are vulnerable to human-induced changes resulting from land and coastal development, such as altered patterns of sedimentation, nutrient enrichment through sewage and agricultural run-off, and are affected by coastal dredging and aquaculture. The consequences of increasing sea surface temperatures and fundamental changes in the carbon chemistry of seawater due to {CO}2 emissions from anthropogenic activities will have serious impacts on calcifying macroalgae. It is not yet understood how interactions between a range of variables acting at local and global scales will influence the viability of calcifying macroalgae and associated ecosystems.

            Plastic debris in the marine environment is widely documented, but the quantity of plastic entering the ocean from waste generated on land is unknown. By linking worldwide data on solid waste, population density, and economic status, we estimated the mass of land-based plastic waste entering the ocean. We calculate that 275 million metric tons ({MT}) of plastic waste was generated in 192 coastal countries in 2010, with 4.8 to 12.7 million {MT} entering the ocean. Population size and the quality of waste management systems largely determine which countries contribute the greatest mass of uncaptured waste available to become plastic marine debris. Without waste management infrastructure improvements, the cumulative quantity of plastic waste available to enter the ocean from land is predicted to increase by an order of magnitude by 2025.},

	title = {Projections of future coral bleaching conditions using {IPCC} {CMIP}6 Models},
	abstract = {The third global coral bleaching event, which started in 2014 and extended well into 2017, was
the longest coral bleaching event on record. The length of the event means corals in some parts
of the world had no time to recover in 2014, 2015 or 2016 during the cool/winter season, prior to
experiencing bleaching the following year. This recent global bleaching event of 2014-2017
represents what climate model projections presented in this Report suggest may become the
norm over the coming two decades. Importantly though, great spatial variation exists in the
projected timing of the onset of annual severe bleaching ({ASB}) conditions among the world’s
coral reefs. {ASB} is calculated as the projected date beyond which a reef is expected to
experience severe bleaching conditions annually (at least 8 Degree Heating Weeks). Variation in
{ASB} timing will be a major driver of differences in the relative vulnerability of coral reef
ecosystems to climate change. Reef areas projected to experience {ASB} much later than other
reef areas could be temporary refugia that have lower climate vulnerability. These refugia may
provide ecosystem goods and services for longer so should be considered as potential
conservation and restoration priorities.
This project team previously developed projections of the exposure component of climate
vulnerability in coral reef areas. These projections were based on the World Climate Research
Programme’s Working Group on Coupled Modelling ({WGCM}) Coupled Model Intercomparison
Project Phase 5 ({CMIP}5) generation of climate models (used by the {IPCC} in the 5th Assessment
Report – {AR}5). These projections, which were statistically downscaled to 4-km are reviewed in
{UNEP} (2017) and van Hooidonk et al. (2016).
This report updates the {UNEP} 2017 report with projections of the timing of severe coral
bleaching conditions using the new generation of climate models used by the {IPCC} – the {CMIP}6
generation of models. The motivation in providing this update is that some {CMIP}6 models have
{\textgreater}4x the spatial resolution (some have native resolutions of ¼ x ¼°; {\textasciitilde} 27 x 27km at the equator)
than {CMIP}5 models (native resolution of 1 x 1°; {\textasciitilde}110 x 110km) and include other
improvements. Further, the {CMIP}6 models are forced by the recently released Shared
Socioeconomic Pathways ({SSPs} – see Riahi (2017) for an overview). The {CMIP}6 models
represent the current state-of-the-art in climate modeling to deliver climate science that informs
regional and global climate policy. These projections presented here are of future exposure to
bleaching conditions (i.e., temperature stress); the socio-ecology of coral reefs within all grid
cells will vary and this variance is not built into these projections.
Projections of the timing of annual severe bleaching conditions are compared in this report for
{SSP}5-8.5 and {SSP}2-4.5 to examine the implications of climate policy for coral reefs.
{SSP}5-8.5 is the pathway that represents current rates of emissions and emissions growth; it is
also considered a “worst-case scenario”. This scenario assumes there is no climate policy or
that policy is not effective. {SSP}5-8.5 represents a growing world economy heavily dependent on
fossil fuels. Results from the {SSP}5-8.5 pathway are most of the focus of this report and can be
seen as using the precautionary principle in planning.
{SSP}2-4.5 is a highly ambitious but plausible scenario. {SSP}2-4.5 is a “middle of the road”
pathway in which emissions continue to increase through the end of the century, reaching
between 65GtCO2 and 85GtCO2, with resulting warming of 3.8-4.2°C. This scenario was selected
because it could represent future conditions if greater levels of emissions reduction ({\textasciitilde}150\% of pledges) are achieved than would result from all Nationally Determined Contributions in the Paris
Agreement combined.
The purpose of this report is threefold:
1. To present projections of coral bleaching conditions (i.e., exposure to the primary climate
threat to coral reefs) and potential adaptation at a spatial scale that enables use of the data in
management and conservation planning and in support of other decisions influencing coral
reefs and reef use;
2. To evaluate the implications of the Paris Agreement as well as failure to achieve its goal, by
comparing the projected timing of annual severe bleaching between Shared Socioeconomic
Pathways {SSP}5-8.5 and {SSP}2-4.5; and
3. To provide public access to the projections data as well as the main findings to catalyze
research that extends the purposes and applications described in 1 and 2, and informs new
research.
The report has been prepared with the coral reef scientific and management community as the
primary target audience.
Results highlights include:
• Under the fossil-fuel aggressive {SSP}5-8.5, {ASB} is projected to occur within this century
for 100\% of the world’s coral reefs. The average projected year of {ASB} is 2034, nine
years earlier than was projected as a global average for {RCP}8.5 using {CMIP}5 models.
This suggests the previous {CMIP}5 generation of projections of future bleaching
conditions underestimated the near future threat of annual severe bleaching.
• Projected exposure to annual severe bleaching conditions varies greatly among and
within countries under {SSP}5-8.5. Coral reefs with relatively early and late exposure to
annual bleaching conditions occur in all of the ocean basins; however, some countries
have more temporary refugia than others. Six of the 20 countries with the greatest reef
area have {\textgreater}25\% temporary refugia (i.e., projected {ASB} after 2044), including: Indonesia
(35\%), western Australia (70\%), The Bahamas (26\%), Madagascar (30\%), India (37\%), and
Malaysia (47\%). Thirteen of the 20 countries with the greatest reef area have {\textgreater}25\% of
reef areas that are projected to experience annual bleaching conditions relatively early.
Some of these countries include the Philippines, Solomon Islands, Fuji, Cuba, and Saudi
Arabia.
It is important to note that these projections should not be interpreted as predictions of
exactly when bleaching will occur and do not imply that any reef areas, including relative
refugia, are safe from severe bleaching.
• The average year for the projected timing of {ASB} under {SSP}2-4.5 is 2045, 11 years later
than the average year projected under {SSP}5-8.5. Successful mitigation in line with the
Paris Agreement would do little to provide reefs with more time to adapt or acclimate
prior to severe coral bleaching conditions occurring annually.
There are three major results from the projections that assume coral adaptation levels
between 0.25° and 2°C: 1) Each quarter degree of assumed adaptation adds {\textasciitilde}7 years to
the global average timing of projected annual severe bleaching; 2) The great majority of
coral reefs ({\textgreater}80\%) are expected to experience {ASB} this century even if 2°C of adaptation
is assumed; 3) There is great spatial variation in the benefits to reefs, in terms of later
{ASB} timing, at each assumed adaption level. The extent to which corals will adapt to
increasing sea temperatures is unknown, but some level of adaptation is expected. If we
assume 1°C of adaptation, the global average {ASB} timing is {\textasciitilde}30 years later than if no
adaptation is assumed.
The projections describe and quantify climate change exposure of coral reefs and thus
contribute to our understanding of coral reef vulnerability. These projections can guide
management, conservation and restoration planning, and be used in education and outreach
programs.
Recommendations for next steps and research priorities include: downscaling the projections to
5-km scale to distinguish what are known to be local-scale differences in average summer
temperatures and the bleaching threshold; better understanding the drivers and spatial patterns
of coral and coral community adaptation to thermal stress; and, combining the projections with
analyses of bleaching observations to identify reef areas that have fared better (‘bright spots’)
or worse (‘dark spots’) than expected during recent bleaching events. Advances in any of those
areas will increase confidence in the projections as well as the capacity of managers to use the
projections in conservation planning, policy, and stakeholder engagement and outreach.},

Tropical seagrass communities are dominated by the turtle grass Thalassia testudinum, whose wide, flattened blades host diverse epibiont communities. Amidst its epibionts, T. testudinum may also be accumulating microplastics, which are a ubiquitous marine pollutant even in remote locales. To assess the extent of microplastic accumulation, seagrass samples were collected from Turneffe Atoll, which lies offshore but parallel with a major urban center. Seventy-five percent of Thalassia blades had encrusted microplastics, with microfibers occurring more than microbeads and chips by a ratio of 59:14. Grazers consumed seagrasses with higher densities of epibionts. Potential mechanisms for microplastic accumulation include entrapment by epibionts, or attachment via biofilms. This study is the first to document microplastics on marine vascular plants, suggesting that macroherbivory is a viable pathway for microplastic pollution to enter marine food webs.},

Several studies have reported the pervasive occurrence and distribution of plastic waste in several marine animals. Therefore, mitigation and reduction of plastic waste originated from land and marine sources have become challenging issues in the current research. In this study, we propose an innovative way to mitigate plastic by using plastic debris as an enhancer of the marine life. Underwater investigations revealed that various plastic forms supported the development of diverse marine algae, particularly the reef building crustose coralline algae and other invertebrates. This proposed method can be implemented for reducing the plastic debris rapidly from different environments.},

	abstract = {Parental effects are ubiquitous in nature and in many organisms play a particularly critical role in the transfer of symbionts across generations; however, their influence and relative importance in the marine environment has rarely been considered. Coral reefs are biologically diverse and productive marine ecosystems, whose success is framed by symbiosis between reefbuilding corals and unicellular dinoflagellates in the genus Symbiodinium. Many corals produce aposymbiotic larvae that are infected by Symbiodinium from the environment (horizontal transmission), which allows for the acquisition of new endosymbionts (different from their parents) each generation. In the remaining species, Symbiodinium are transmitted directly from parent to offspring via eggs (vertical transmission), a mechanism that perpetuates the relationship between some or all of the Symbiodinium diversity found in the parent through multiple generations. Here we examine vertical transmission in the Hawaiian coral Montipora capitata by comparing the Symbiodinium {ITS}2 sequence assemblages in parent colonies and the eggs they produce. Parental effects on sequence assemblages in eggs are explored in the context of the coral genotype, colony morphology, and the environment of parent colonies. Our results indicate that {ITS}2 sequence assemblages in eggs are generally similar to their parents, and patterns in parental assemblages are different, and reflect environmental conditions, but not colony morphology or coral genotype. We conclude that eggs released by parent colonies during mass spawning events are seeded with different {ITS}2 sequence assemblages, which encompass phylogenetic variability that may have profound implications for the development, settlement and survival of coral offspring.},

	abstract = {The release of gametes into the water column by broadcast-spawning marine invertebrates represents the culmination of several physiological events in the parents and the first step in the supply of new recruits to marine ecosystem. The input of new propagules to coral reefs relies on spawning events that display remarkable synchronicity during limited periods each year. Although the timing of spawning is known for most species, other aspects of coral reproduction (polyp fecundity or spawning synchronicity) are less understood. This largely reflects the sporadic nature of reproductive activities and logistical problems of studying the ephemeral coral spawning events in situ on the reef at night. Here, we address this gap by exploring the spatial and temporal spawning dynamics of Montipora capitata, a broadcast-spawning, reef-building coral from the central Pacific Ocean, by using the systematic sampling of gametes in the field. Our results indicate that spawning in this species varies among years, months and lunar days, and that the proportion of colonies spawning and synchrony of spawning do not reflect coral colony morphology, colony size or the differences in environments between sites within a year. Major differences in reproductive outputs (spawned material) were observed between the 2 yr studied, which most probably reflects variability in temperature between years or shifts in the timing of spawning (phenology). This study highlights the complexity of spawning dynamics in corals and suggests that a more comprehensive understanding of interplay between reproduction and environment is fundamentally important to accurately predict the effects of climate change in these important ecosystems.},

To advance our capacity to scale and maximize the efficiency of restoration initiatives, we examined how abiotic conditions (i.e. larval rearing temperature, substrate condition, light intensity, and flow rate) interact to enhance post-settlement survival and growth of sexually propagated juvenile Montipora capitata. Larvae were reared at 3 temperatures (high: 28.9°C, ambient: 27.2°C, low: 24.5°C) for 72 h during larval development, and were subsequently settled on aragonite plugs conditioned in seawater (1 or 10 wk) and raised in different light and flow regimes. These juvenile corals underwent a natural bleaching event in Kāne‘ohe Bay, O‘ahu, Hawai‘i ({USA}), in summer 2019, allowing us to opportunistically measure bleaching response in addition to survivorship and growth. This study demonstrates how leveraging light and flow can increase the survivorship and growth of juvenile M. capitata. In contrast, larval preconditioning and substrate conditioning had little overall effect on survivorship, growth, or bleaching response. Importantly, there was no optimal combination of abiotic conditions that maximized survival and growth in addition to bleaching tolerances. This study highlights the ability to tailor sexual reproduction for specific restoration goals by addressing knowledge gaps and incorporating practices that could improve resilience in propagated stocks.},

Crustose coralline algae cover 39\% of the reef surface and exceed all other organisms as the major builders and consolidators of reef materials. An unidentified coralline (melobesioid C) covers the greatest area (17 \%), but Hydrollthon reinboldii (Weber-van Bosse \& Foslie) Foslie (11 \% cover) because of its thicker thalli and higher relative density (45 \%) and frequency (68 \%) values is the primary limestone former. Melobesioid C ranks second and Sporolithon erythraeum (Rothpletz) Kylin (6 \% cover) third in relative importance. Porolithon onkodes (Heydrich) Foslie (3 \% cover), although shown by its low density (4 \%) and frequency (6 \%) to have a comparatively restricted distribution, is more important than P. gardineri (Foslie) Foslie (2 \% cover). P. onkodes maintains and provides the surf-resistant reef edge and is, therefore, of great ecological importance. Coelenterate corals cover less than 1 \% of the total area and are relatively unimportant on the fringing reef. The hypothesis is developed that the high ratio (200 : 1) of crustose corallines to corals at Waikiki may be partly due to increases in eutrophication. Experimental evidence shows that P. onkodes can withstand intense illumination and is thereby unique among Hawaiian crustose Corallinaceae. Sporolithon erythraeum is more typical of other crustose corallines since it is physiologically adapted to low-light habitats.},

	abstract = {Calcified macroalgae play an important role in the settlement and metamorphosis of invertebrate larvae in coral reef ecosystems. However, little is known about the algal-associated bacterial communities and their effects on larval settlement. In this study, the responses of larvae of the coral Pocillopora damicornis to calcified algae (Porolithon onkodes, Halimeda cylindracea, Halimeda opuntia and Amphiroa fragilissima) were evaluated. The results revealed that Por. onkodes and H. cylindracea significantly enhanced the rates of settlement and metamorphosis, whereas fewer larvae settled on Am. fragilissima and H. opuntia. Amplicon pyrosequencing of the V3-V4 region of 16S {rDNA} was applied to investigate the relationship between algal bacterial community and larval settlement. Principal coordinates analysis demonstrated that the bacterial community composition of H. opuntia was more similar to that of Am. fragilissima, but clearly distinct from those of H. cylindracea and Por. onkodes. Furthermore, the relative abundances of bacteria were highly diverse among different algae. H. opuntia had higher percentages of Thalassobius, Pelagibius and {SM}1A02, whereas the abundances of Mycoplasma and Suttonella were significantly higher in H. cylindracea than other algae. Our results showed that larval settlement/metamorphosis was strongly correlated with the bacterial community composition and with the relative abundance of a few operational taxonomic units.},

	abstract = {Salinity is one of the major threats to sustainable agriculture that globally decreases plant production by impairing various physiological, biochemical, and molecular function. In particular, salinity hampers germina­ tion, growth, photosynthesis, transpiration, and stomatal conductance. Salinity decreases leaf water potential and turgor pressure and generates osmotic stress. Salinity enhances reactive oxygen species ({ROS}) content in the plant cell as a result of ion toxicity and disturbs ion homeostasis. Thus, it imbalances nutrient uptake, disinte­ grates membrane, and various ultrastructure. Consequently, salinity leads to osmotic and ionic stress. Plants respond to salinity by modulating various morpho-physiological, anatomical, and biochemical traits by regu­ lating ion homeostasis and compartmentalization, antioxidant machinery, and biosynthesis of osmoprotectants and phytohormones, i. e, auxins, abscisic acid, brassinosteroids, cytokinins, ethylene, gibberellins, salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, and polyamines. Thus, this further modulates plant osmoticum, decreases ion toxicity, and scavenges {ROS}. Plants upregulate various genes and proteins that participate in salinity tolerance. They also promote the production of various phytohormones and metabolites that mitigate the toxic effect of salinity. Based on recent papers, the deleterious effect of salinity on plant physiology is discussed. Furthermore, it evaluates the physiological and biochemical responses of the plant to salinity along with phytohormone response. This review paper also highlights omics (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics) approach to understand salt stress tolerance.},

Epigenetic mechanisms may be crucial for sessile benthic marine organisms, such as reef-building corals, where ocean acidification ({OA}) and warming reflect in strong negative responses. We tested the potential for scleractinian corals to exhibit phenotypic plasticity associated with a change in {DNA} methylation in response to {OA}. Clonal coral fragments of the environmentally sensitive Pocillopora damicornis and more environmentally robust Montipora capitata were exposed to fluctuating ambient {pH} (7.9–7.65) and low {pH} (7.6–7.35) conditions in common garden tanks for 6 weeks. M. capitata responded weakly, or acclimated more quickly, to {OA}, with no difference in calcification, minimal separation of metabolomic profiles, and no change in {DNA} methylation between treatments. Conversely, P. damicornis exhibited diminished calcification at low {pH}, stronger separation in metabolomic profiles, and responsiveness of {DNA} methylation to treatment. Our data suggest corals differ in their temporal dynamics and sensitivity for environmentally triggered real-time epigenetic reprogramming. The generation of potentially heritable plasticity via environmental induction of {DNA} methylation provides an avenue for assisted evolution applications in corals under rapid climate change.},

	abstract = {Environmental metabolomics is the application of metabolomics to characterise the interactions of organisms with their environment. This approach has many advantages for studying organism–environment interactions and for assessing organism function and health at the molecular level. As such, metabolomics is finding an increasing number of applications in the environmental sciences, ranging from understanding organismal responses to abiotic pressures, to investigating the responses of organisms to other biota. These interactions can be studied from individuals to populations, which can be related to the traditional fields of ecophysiology and ecology, and from instantaneous effects to those over evolutionary time scales, the latter enabling studies of genetic adaptation. This review provides a comprehensive and current overview of environmental metabolomics research. We begin with an overview of metabolomic studies into the effects of abiotic pressures on organisms. In the field of ecophysiology, studies on the metabolic responses to temperature, water, food availability, light and circadian rhythms, atmospheric gases and season are reviewed. A section on ecotoxicogenomics discusses research in aquatic and terrestrial ecotoxicology, assessing organismal responses to anthropogenic pollutants in both the laboratory and field. We then discuss environmental metabolomic studies of diseases and biotic–biotic interactions, in particular herbivory. Finally, we critically evaluate the contribution that metabolomics has made to the environmental sciences, and highlight and discuss recommendations to advance our understanding of the environment, ecology and evolution using a metabolomics approach.},

	abstract = {Red coralline algae are a cosmopolitan group with the ability to precipitate {CaCO}3 within the walls of their vegetative cells. The resultant carbonate structure is key for explaining their ecological success, as it provides protection against herbivores and resistance to water motion. However, its potential contribution to enhance thallus light absorption efficiency through multiple light scattering on algal skeleton, similar to the effect documented for scleractinian corals, has not been yet investigated. Here, we initiate this analysis, characterizing thallus optical properties of three coralline species, which differed in pigment content and thallus mass area ({TMA}, {gDW} m−2). The three species, the rhodolith Neogoniolithon sp., the crustose coralline alga ({CCA}), Lithothamnion sp., and the articulated alga Amphiroa tribulus, represent the more distinctive coralline growth-forms and are able to colonize contrasting light environments in Caribbean coral reefs. The thicker thalli of the rhodoliths were the most efficient light collectors, as evidenced by their higher pigment absorption efficiency (a*Chla; m2 {mgChla}−1) and photosynthetic rates per unit area. This could explain rhodolith success in oligotrophic, highly illuminated reef environments. In contrast, the thinner thalli of the {CCA}, a low-light specialist, showed the highest metabolic rates normalized to mass and the highest light absorption efficiencies per unit mass (a*M; m2 gdw−1). Therefore, the ecological success of the {CCA} in cryptic habitats within the reef cannot be explained only by its low-light physiology, but also by its capacity to reduce the structural costs of their thalli, and thus of its new growth. Lastly, the ecological success of Amphiroa tribulus, which displayed intermediate values for the efficiency of light absorption, metabolic rates and {TMA}, was explained by its ability to construct the largest light collectors (algal canopies) thanks to the presence of flexible, non-calcified segments (genicula). This ability enables enhanced photosynthetic and carbonate production at the organism/canopy level. The resulting fragile canopy survives best within the protection provided by colonies of the lettuce coral Agaricia agaricites. In conclusion, our study demonstrates the utility of optical traits as powerful tools to investigate differences in the competitive abilities, abundances and niche distribution among algal species and/or growth-forms.},

	abstract = {Coral reefs, and their associated diverse ecosystems, are of enormous ecological importance. In recent years, coral health has been severely impacted by environmental stressors brought on by human activity and climate change, threatening the extinction of several major reef ecosystems. Reef damage is mediated by a process called ‘coral bleaching’ where corals, sea anemones, and other cnidarians lose their photosynthetic algal symbionts (family Symbiodiniaceae) upon stress induction, resulting in drastically decreased host energy harvest and, ultimately, coral death. The mechanism by which this critical cnidarian-algal symbiosis is lost remains poorly understood. The larvae of the sea anemone, Exaiptasia pallida (commonly referred to as ‘Aiptasia’) are an attractive model organism to study this process, but they are large (∼100 mm in length, ∼75 mm in diameter), deformable, and highly motile, complicating long-term imaging and limiting study of this critical endosymbiotic relationship in live organisms. Here, we report ‘Traptasia’, a simple microfluidic device with multiple traps designed to isolate and image individual, live larvae of Aiptasia and their algal symbionts over extended time courses. Using a trap design parameterized via fluid flow simulations and polymer bead loading tests, we trapped Aiptasia larvae containing algal symbionts and demonstrated stable imaging for {\textgreater}10 hours. We visualized algae within Aiptasia larvae and observed algal expulsion under an environmental stressor. To our knowledge, this device is the first to enable time-lapsed, high-throughput live imaging of cnidarian larvae and their algal symbionts and, in further implementation, could provide important insights into the cellular mechanisms of cnidarian bleaching under different environmental stressors. The ‘Traptasia’ device is simple to use, requires minimal external equipment and no specialized training to operate, and can easily be adapted using the trap optimization data presented here to study a variety of large, motile organisms.},

Additionally, proteomic studies, especially related to clinical studies have been popular since 1970s. In last decade, owing to technological advances, considerable progress has been made in the metabolic studies of several biological phenomena, ranging from clinical to environmental studies. Since the advent of the Human Genome consortium in the 1990s, there has been an exponential progress in the studies of not only genomics (and metagenomics), but also transcriptomics and proteomics. A rapid rise in metabolomics and its complementation to the former researches has necessitated the combination of all these techniques to obtain a broader picture of the biological system. A combination study, broadly termed as ‘Multi-omics’ has been a field of interest since 2008. A ‘multi-omics’ approach combines major fields such as genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics, in addition to minor omics-based approaches such as fluxomics, ionomics and lipidomics (among others) in order to obtain elaborate knowledge of an entire biological system, in a single study. This chapter discusses the progress of multi-omics in recent years and presents some case studies in multiple fields such as human health, the environment, industrial biotechnology and biofuel studies among others. The chapter also discusses the development of various analytical methods and databases in multi-omics, with tentative future trends in the field.},

	abstract = {Microplastics are emerging contaminants in the marine environment. They enter the ocean in a variety of sizes and shapes, with plastic microfiber being the prevalent form in seawater and in the guts of biota. Most of the laboratory experiments on microplastics has been performed with spheres, so knowledge on the interactions of microfibers and marine organisms is limited. In this study we examined the ingestion of microfibers by the sea anemone Aiptasia pallida using three different types of polymers: nylon, polyester and polypropylene. The polymers were offered to both symbiotic (with algal symbionts) and bleached (without algal symbionts) anemones. The polymers were introduced either alone or mixed with brine shrimp homogenate. We observed a higher percentage of nylon ingestion compared to the other polymers when plastic was offered in the absence of shrimp. In contrast, we observed over 80\% of the anemones taking up all types of polymers when the plastics were offered in the presence of shrimp. Retention time differed significantly between symbiotic and bleached anemones with faster egestion in symbiotic anemones. Our results suggest that ingestion of microfibers by sea anemones is dependent both on the type of polymers and on the presence of chemical cues of prey in seawater. The decreased ability of bleached anemones to reject plastic microfiber indicates that the susceptibility of anthozoans to plastic pollution is exacerbated by previous exposure to other stressors. This is particularly concerning given that coral reef ecosystems are facing increases in the frequency and intensity of bleaching events due to ocean warming. (C) 2019 The Authors.

	abstract = {World production of plastic has dramatically increased from the 1950's and now it reaches approximately 311 million tons per year. The resulting accumulation of small plastic detritus less than 5 mm in size, termed "microplastics", has started threatening the life cycles of marine organisms. Here we show the first evidence that microplastics disturb the initiation of symbiotic relationships in anthozoan-algae symbiosis. We found in both the aposymbiotic sea-anemone Aiptasia sp. and the coral Favites chinensis that the infectivity of symbiotic algae into the host is severely suppressed by microspheres fed either directly or indirectly through microsphere-fed Anemia sp. Similar trends were seen when microplastics collected from commercial facewash were used instead of microspheres. Therefore, ongoing accumulation of microplastics in the ocean might disturb the healthy anthozoan-algae symbiotic relationships, which are cornerstones of the biologically enriched coral reef ecosystem.},

Anemone weight, crown area, and number of tentacles were measured before and after 12 days of daily pellet consumption. Crown area significantly increased for control anemones only. Fresh anemones were then sequentially fed consumed and egested pellets from two of the earlier daily trials to measure feeding retention time, which decreased over three to four feedings. The concentrations of elements in anemones (zinc, iron, arsenic, manganese, chromium, copper, vanadium, selenium, nickel, cadmium, and cobalt) were similar to control anemones that were not exposed to pellets. Lead concentrations were significantly higher in anemones fed {HDPE} {III} pellets as compared to control.

There was a higher incorporation of microspheres into bleached corals than in healthy ones. To understand the interference in symbiosis, we used the sea anemone Exaiptasia (as an anthozoan model organism) and fed it with microspheres. {TEM} results suggested the incorporation of microspheres and symbionts from the same phagocytosis zones in the mesenterial filament and endocytosis by the cells. In the tentacles, microspheres were in the same cell layer as the symbionts.

In particular, studies on how {MPs} impact microalgae are required because of the abundance of {MPs} and importance of green microalgae as primary producers. This study investigated how {MPs} that are larger (200 μm) than algal cells impact them, using the marine microalga Dunaliella salina as the test species. The microalga was exposed to polyethylene {MPs} for 6 days. Of interest, the growth and photosynthetic activity of D. salina was enhanced with exposure to {MPs}, while cell morphology (size and granularity) was not impacted. This phenomenon might be explained by trace concentrations of additive chemicals (endocrine disruptors, phthalates, stabilizers) that possibly leached from {MPs} promoting the growth and photosynthetic activity of D. salina. We also confirmed that {MP} size contributes towards determining how plastics affect microalgae. Specifically, as {MP} size shrinks compared to algal cell size, {MPs} have increasingly adverse effects. {MPs} of very small size (like nanoplastics) induce particularly adverse effects on algae. Further studies are required to establish the relationship between algal cell size and {MP} size.},

	abstract = {Globally, anomalously warm temperature events have increased by 34\% in frequency and 17\% in duration from 1925 to 2016 with potentially major impacts on coastal ecosystems. These “marine heatwaves” ({MHWs}) have been linked to changes in primary productivity, community composition and biogeography of seaweeds, which often control ecosystem function and services. Here we review the literature on seaweed responses to {MHWs}, including 58 observations related to resistance, bleaching, changes in abundance, species invasions and local to regional extinctions. More records existed for canopy-forming kelps and bladed and filamentous turf-forming seaweeds than for canopy-forming fucoids, geniculate coralline turf and crustose coralline algae. Turf-forming seaweeds, especially invasive seaweeds, generally increased in abundance after a {MHW}, whereas native canopy-forming kelps and fucoids typically declined in abundance. We also found four examples of regional extinctions of kelp and fucoids following specific {MHWs}, events that likely have long term consequences for ecological structure and functioning. Although a relatively small number of studies have described impacts of {MHWs} on seaweed, the broad range of documented responses highlights the necessity of better baseline information regarding seaweed distributions and performance, and the need to study specific characteristics of {MHWs} that affect the vulnerability and resilience of seaweeds to these increasingly important climatic perturbations. A major challenge will be to disentangle impacts caused by the extreme temperature increases of {MHWs} itself from co-occurring potential stressors including altered current patterns, increasing herbivory, changes in water clarity and nutrient content, solar radiation and desiccation stress in the intertidal zone. With future increases anticipated in the intensity, duration and frequencies of {MHWs}, we expect to see more replacements of large long-lived habitat forming seaweeds with smaller ephemeral seaweeds, reducing the habitat structure and effective services seaweed-dominated reefs can provide.},

We first compared the intensity of {PCR} product bands obtained with and without the blocking primers. Then, one primer was selected for further verification using high-throughput sequencing. Our results showed that X-{BP}2-{DPO} was the most effective blocking primer in suppressing the host 18S amplification compared to nine other candidates.

In much of the country, opposition to marine aquaculture by local and national interest groups and local, state, tribal, or national policies have limited marine aquaculture to a scale far below its potential. There are several reason for this: (1) Marine aquaculture is relatively small, diverse, and (with some notable exceptions) unproven; (2) marine waters are public resources; (3) some Americans perceive potential negative effects of marine aquaculture without offsetting positive effects; (4) aquaculture faces signiﬁcant social opposition; and (5) the governance system for leasing and regulation hinders the development of U.S. marine aquaculture. This article discusses ﬁve broad strategies and recent efforts to advance marine aquaculture in the United States: (1) ﬁxing problems, (2) creating beneﬁts, (3) building partnerships, (4) arguing effectively, and (5) reforming governance.},

	abstract = {Studies of the impacts of climate change on Arctic marine ecosystems have largely centered on endemic species and ecosystems, and the people who rely on them. Fewer studies have focused on the northward expansion of upper trophic level ({UTL}) subarctic species. We provide an overview of changes in the temporal and spatial distributions of subarctic fish, birds, and cetaceans, with a focus on the Pacific Arctic Region. Increasing water temperatures throughout the Arctic have increased "thermal habitat" for subarctic fish species, resulting in northward shifts of species including walleye pollock and pink salmon. Ecosystem changes are altering the community composition and species richness of seabirds in the Arctic, as water temperatures change the available prey field, which dictates the presence of planktivorous versus piscivorous seabird species. Finally, subarctic whales, among them killer and humpback whales, are arriving earlier, staying later, and moving consistently farther north, as evidenced by aerial survey and acoustic detections. Increasing ice-free habitat and changes in water mass distributions in the Arctic are altering the underlying prey structure, drawing {UTL} species northward by increasing their spatial and temporal habitat. A large-scale shuffling of subarctic and Arctic communities is reorganizing high-latitude marine ecosystems. Two transient killer whales in the Chukchi Sea in September 2017. Image credit: K.M.

	abstract = {For decades, studies of endocrine-disrupting chemicals ({EDCs}) have challenged traditional concepts in toxicology, in particular the dogma of "the dose makes the poison," because {EDCs} can have effects at low doses that are not predicted by effects at higher doses. Here, we review two major concepts in {EDC} studies: low dose and nonmonotonicity. Low-dose effects were defined by the National Toxicology Program as those that occur in the range of human exposures or effects observed at doses below those used for traditional toxicological studies. We review the mechanistic data for low-dose effects and use a weight-of-evidence approach to analyze five examples from the {EDC} literature. Additionally, we explore nonmonotonic dose-response curves, defined as a nonlinear relationship between dose and effect where the slope of the curve changes sign somewhere within the range of doses examined. We provide a detailed discussion of the mechanisms responsible for generating these phenomena, plus hundreds of examples from the cell culture, animal, and epidemiology literature. We illustrate that nonmonotonic responses and low-dose effects are remarkably common in studies of natural hormones and {EDCs}. Whether low doses of {EDCs} influence certain human disorders is no longer conjecture, because epidemiological studies show that environmental exposures to {EDCs} are associated with human diseases and disabilities. We conclude that when nonmonotonic dose-response curves occur, the effects of low doses cannot be predicted by the effects observed at high doses. Thus, fundamental changes in chemical testing and safety determination are needed to protect human health.},

The pancreas analysed only in Leatherback turtles exhibited the highest metal concentrations, which is very surprising for an organ which does not play a role in the detoxification processes. The distribution of these elements in kidney, liver and muscle were quite similar to that found in marine mammals or seabirds. Nevertheless, mean cadmium concentrations in the kidney were as high as 13.3 μg g−1 wet weight in the Loggerhead turtles and 30.3 μg g−1 wet weight in the Leatherback turtles. Such high concentrations in the Leatherback turtles have never been recorded before. The main source of cadmium for marine turtles is probably the food. The Leatherback turtles are known to feed mainly on jellyfish in this area. Ten times higher cadmium concentrations have been determined in jellyfish compared to fish. This would imply a greater exposure to cadmium for Leatherback turtles, which probably need to eat great quantities of jellyfish to cover their needs.},

	abstract = {In  \textit{Pollution Is Colonialism}  Max Liboiron presents a framework for understanding scientific research methods as
practices that can align with or against colonialism. They point
out that even when researchers are working toward benevolent goals, environmental science and activism are often premised on a colonial worldview and access to land. Focusing on plastic pollution, the
book models an anticolonial scientific practice aligned with
Indigenous, particularly Métis, concepts of land, ethics, and
relations. Liboiron draws on their work in the Civic Laboratory for Environmental Action Research ({CLEAR})-an anticolonial science
laboratory in Newfoundland, Canada-to illuminate how pollution is not a symptom of capitalism but a violent enactment of colonial
land relations that claim access to Indigenous land. Liboiron's
creative, lively, and passionate text refuses theories of pollution that make Indigenous land available for settler and colonial goals. In this way, their methodology demonstrates that anticolonial
science is not only possible but is currently being practiced in
ways that enact more ethical modes of being in the world.},

We note several findings. First, across the past five decades, psychological publications that highlight race have been rare, and although they have increased in developmental and social psychology, they have remained virtually nonexistent in cognitive psychology. Second, most publications have been edited by White editors, under which there have been significantly fewer publications that highlight race. Third, many of the publications that highlight race have been written by White authors who employed significantly fewer participants of color. In many cases, we document variation as a function of area and decade. We argue that systemic inequality exists within psychological research and that systemic changes are needed to ensure that psychological research benefits from diversity in editing, writing, and participation. To this end, and in the spirit of the field’s recent emphasis on metascience, we offer recommendations for journals and authors.},

	abstract = {Kaneohe Bay, which is located on the on the {NE} coast of Oahu, Hawaii, represents one of the most intensively studied estuarine coral reef ecosystems in the world. Despite a long history of anthropogenic disturbance, from early settlement to post European contact, the coral reef ecosystem of Kaneohe Bay appears to be in better condition in comparison to other reefs around the world. The island of Moku o Loe (Coconut Island) in the southern region of the bay became home to the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology in 1947, where researchers have since documented the various aspects of the unique physical, chemical, and biological features of this coral reef ecosystem. The first human contact by voyaging Polynesians occurred at least 700 years ago. By A. D. 1250 Polynesians voyagers had settled inhabitable islands in the region which led to development of an intensive agricultural, fish pond and ocean resource system that supported a large human population. Anthropogenic disturbance initially involved clearing of land for agriculture, intentional or accidental introduction of alien species, modification of streams to supply water for taro culture, and construction of massive shoreline fish pond enclosures and extensive terraces in the valleys that were used for taro culture. The arrival by the first Europeans in 1778 led to further introductions of plants and animals that radically changed the landscape. Subsequent development of a plantation agricultural system led to increased human immigration, population growth and an end to traditional land and water management practices. The reefs were devastated by extensive dredge and fill operations as well as rapid growth of human population, which led to extensive urbanization of the watershed. By the 1960' s the bay was severely impacted by increased sewage discharge along with increased sedimentation due to improper grading practices and stream channelization, resulting in extensive loss of coral cover. The reefs of Kaneohe Bay developed under estuarine conditions and thus have been subjected to multiple natural stresses. These include storm floods, a more extreme temperature range than more oceanic reefs, high rates of sedimentation, and exposure at extreme low tides. Deposition and degradation of organic materials carried into the bay from the watershed results in low {pH} conditions such that according to some ocean acidification projections the rich coral reefs in the bay should not exist. Increased global temperature due to anthropogenic fossil fuel emmisions is now impacting these reefs with the first "bleaching event" in 1996 and a second more severe event in 2014. The reefs of Kaneohe Bay have developed and persist under rather severe natural and anthropogenic perturbations. To date, these reefs have proved to be very resilient once the stressor has been removed. A major question remains to be answered concerning the limits of Kaneohe Bay reef resilience in the face of global climate change.},

To examine why tribal nations vary in translating wind energy potential into wind installed capacity, we have constructed an original dataset of the potential as well as the location of wind turbines across tribal nations. Our statistical analysis of 286 tribal nations suggests that wind energy potential is not associated with wind installed capacity. Instead, casino square footage, a proxy for tribal nation’s administrative capacity and business acumen, is associated with wind installed capacity. Political orientation plays a role as well: tribal nations are more likely to have wind installed capacity when they value tribal sovereignty. While tribes suffering from natural disasters do not install more wind turbines, those receiving federal grants for wind energy projects, and located in states that already have a substantial number of wind turbines, are more apt to have wind turbines. Surprisingly, tribes located in states with renewable portfolio standards do not show an association with installed wind turbines capacity.},

	abstract = {Endocrine disruption is suspected in cnidarians, but questions remain how occurs. Steroid sex hormones are detected in corals and sea anemones even though these animals do not have estrogen receptors and their repertoire of steroidogenic enzymes appears to be incomplete. Pathways associated with sex hormone biosynthesis and sterol signaling are an understudied area in cnidarian biology. The objective of this study was to identify a suite of genes that can be linked to exposure of endocrine disruptors. Exaiptasia diaphana were exposed to nominal 20ppb concentrations of estradiol (E2), testosterone (T), cholesterol, oxybenzone ({BP}-3), or benzyl butyl phthalate ({BBP}) for 4 h. Eleven genes of interest ({GOIs}) were chosen from a previously generated {EST} library. The {GOIs} are 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases type 14 (17β {HSD}14) and type 12 (17β {HSD}12), Niemann-Pick C type 2 ({NPC}2), Equistatin ({EI}), Complement component C3 (C3), Cathepsin L ({CTSL}), Patched domain-containing protein 3 ({PTCH}3), Smoothened ({SMO}), Desert Hedgehog ({DHH}), Zinc finger protein {GLI}2 ({GLI}2), and Vitellogenin ({VTG}). These {GOIs} were selected because of functional associations with steroid hormone biosynthesis; cholesterol binding/transport; immunity; phagocytosis; or Hedgehog signaling. Quantitative Real-Time {PCR} quantified expression of {GOIs}. In silico modelling utilized protein structures from Protein Data Bank as well as creating protein structures with {SWISS}-{MODEL}. Results show transcription of steroidogenic enzymes, and cholesterol binding/transport proteins have similar transcription profiles for E2, T, and cholesterol treatments, but different profiles when {BP}-3 or {BBP} is present. C3 expression can differentiate between exposures to {BP}-3 versus {BBP} as well as exposure to cholesterol versus sex hormones. In silico modelling revealed all ligands (E2, T, cholesterol, {BBP}, and {BP}-3) have favorable binding affinities with 17β {HSD}14, 17β {HSD}12, {NPC}2, {SMO}, and {PTCH} proteins. {VTG} expression was down-regulated in the sterol treatments but up-regulated in {BP}-3 and {BBP} treatments. In summary, these eleven {GOIs} collectively generate unique transcriptional profiles capable of discriminating between the five chemical exposures used in this investigation. This suite of {GOIs} are candidate biomarkers for detecting transcriptional changes in steroidogenesis, gametogenesis, sterol transport, and Hedgehog signaling. Detection of disruptions in these pathways offers new insight into endocrine disruption in cnidarians.},

Sublethal endpoints developed in cnidarians include budding, regeneration, gametogenesis, mucus production and larval metamorphosis. Cnidarian genomic databases, microarrays and other molecular tools are increasingly facilitating mechanistic investigation of signaling pathways and signal disruption. Elucidation of cnidarian signaling processes in a comparative context can provide insight into the evolution and diversification of metazoan bioregulation.

Without this knowledge, health-based consumption advisories can not be determined for consumers that include Tribes and First Nations, Asian and Pacific Islander community members, and recreational harvesters. We measured contaminant concentrations in edible seaweeds (Fucus distichus, F. spiralis, and Nereocystis luetkeana) from 43 locations in the Salish Sea. Metals were analyzed in all samples, and 94 persistent organic pollutants ({POPs}) (i.e. 40 {PCBs}, 15 {PBDEs}, 17 {PCDD}/Fs, and 22 organochlorine pesticides) and 51 {PAHs} were analyzed in Fucus spp. We compared concentrations of contaminants to human health-based screening levels calculated from the {USEPA} and to international limits. We then worked with six focal contaminants that either exceeded screening levels or international limits (Cd, total Hg, Pb, benzo[a]pyrene [{BaP}], and {PCBs}) or are of regional interest (total As). {USEPA} cancer-based screening levels were exceeded in 30 samples for the {PCBs} and two samples for {BaP}. Cadmium concentrations did not exceed the {USEPA} noncancer-based screening level but did exceed international limits at all sites. Lead exceeded international limits at three sites. Because there are no screening levels for total Hg and total As, and to be conservative, we made comparisons to methyl Hg and inorganic As screening levels. All samples were below the methyl Hg and above the inorganic As screening levels. Without knowledge of the As speciation, we cannot assess the health risk associated with the As. While seaweed was the focus, we did not consider contaminant exposure from consuming other foods. Other chemicals, such as contaminants of emerging concern (e.g., {PFAS}, pharmaceuticals and personal care products), should also be considered. Additionally, although we focused on toxicological aspects, there are cultural and health benefits of seaweed use that may affect consumer choice.},

	abstract = {Microbiome assemblages of plants and animals often show a degree of correlation with host phylogeny; an eco-evolutionary pattern known as phylosymbiosis. Using 16S {rRNA} gene sequencing to profile the microbiome, paired with {COI}, 18S {rRNA} and {ITS}1 host phylogenies, phylosymbiosis was investigated in four groups of coral reef invertebrates (scleractinian corals, octocorals, sponges and ascidians). We tested three commonly used metrics to evaluate the extent of phylosymbiosis: (a) intraspecific versus interspecific microbiome variation, (b) topological comparisons between host phylogeny and hierarchical clustering (dendrogram) of host-associated microbial communities, and (c) correlation of host phylogenetic distance with microbial community dissimilarity. In all instances, intraspecific variation in microbiome composition was significantly lower than interspecific variation. Similarly, topological congruency between host phylogeny and the associated microbial dendrogram was more significant than would be expected by chance across all groups, except when using unweighted {UniFrac} distance (compared with weighted {UniFrac} and Bray–Curtis dissimilarity). Interestingly, all but the ascidians showed a significant positive correlation between host phylogenetic distance and associated microbial dissimilarity. Our findings provide new perspectives on the diverse nature of marine phylosymbioses and the complex roles of the microbiome in the evolution of marine invertebrates.},

	abstract = {Although the early coral reef-bleaching warning system ({NOAA}/{USA}) is established, there is no feasible treatment that can minimize temperature bleaching and/or disease impacts on corals in the field. Here, we present the first attempts to extrapolate the widespread and well-established use of bacterial consortia to protect or improve health in other organisms (e.g., humans and plants) to corals. Manipulation of the coral-associated microbiome was facilitated through addition of a consortium of native (isolated from Pocillopora damicornis and surrounding seawater) putatively beneficial microorganisms for corals ({pBMCs}), including five Pseudoalteromonas sp., a Halomonas taeanensis and a Cobetia marina-related species strains. The results from a controlled aquarium experiment in two temperature regimes (26 °C and 30 °C) and four treatments ({pBMC}; {pBMC} with pathogen challenge – Vibrio coralliilyticus, {VC}; pathogen challenge, {VC}; and control) revealed the ability of the {pBMC} consortium to partially mitigate coral bleaching. Significantly reduced coral-bleaching metrics were observed in {pBMC}-inoculated corals, in contrast to controls without {pBMC} addition, especially challenged corals, which displayed strong bleaching signs as indicated by significantly lower photopigment contents and Fv/Fm ratios. The structure of the coral microbiome community also differed between treatments and specific bioindicators were correlated with corals inoculated with {pBMC} (e.g., Cobetia sp.) or {VC} (e.g., Ruegeria sp.). Our results indicate that the microbiome in corals can be manipulated to lessen the effect of bleaching, thus helping to alleviate pathogen and temperature stresses, with the addition of {BMCs} representing a promising novel approach for minimizing coral mortality in the face of increasing environmental impacts.},

	abstract = {Marine invertebrates harbour a complex suite of bacterial and archaeal symbionts, a subset of which are probably linked to host health and homeostasis. Within a complex microbiome it can be difficult to tease apart beneficial or parasitic symbionts from nonessential commensal or transient microorganisms; however, one approach is to detect strong cophylogenetic patterns between microbial lineages and their respective hosts. We employed the Procrustean approach to cophylogeny ({PACo}) on 16S {rRNA} gene derived microbial community profiles paired with {COI}, 18S {rRNA} and {ITS}1 host phylogenies. Second, we undertook a network analysis to identify groups of microbes that were co-occurring within our host species. Across 12 coral, 10 octocoral and five sponge species, each host group and their core microbiota (50\% prevalence within host species replicates) had a significant fit to the cophylogenetic model. Independent assessment of each microbial genus and family found that bacteria and archaea affiliated to Endozoicomonadaceae, Spirochaetaceae and Nitrosopumilaceae have the strongest cophylogenetic signals. Further, local Moran's I measure of spatial autocorrelation identified 14 {ASVs}, including Endozoicomonadaceae and Spirochaetaceae, whose distributions were significantly clustered by host phylogeny. Four co-occurring subnetworks were identified, each of which was dominant in a different host group. Endozoicomonadaceae and Spirochaetaceae {ASVs} were abundant among the subnetworks, particularly one subnetwork that was exclusively comprised of these two bacterial families and dominated the octocoral microbiota. Our results disentangle key microbial interactions that occur within complex microbiomes and reveal long-standing, essential microbial symbioses in coral reef invertebrates.},

	abstract = {The sustainability of coral reef fisheries is jeopardized by complex and interacting socio-ecological stressors that undermine their contribution to food and nutrition security. Climate change has emerged as one of the key stressors threatening coral reefs and their fish-associated services. How fish nutrient concentrations respond to warming oceans remains unclear but these responses are probably affected by both direct (metabolism and trophodynamics) and indirect (habitat and species range shifts) effects. Climate-driven coral habitat loss can cause changes in fish abundance and biomass, revealing potential winners and losers among major fisheries targets that can be predicted using ecological indicators and biological traits. A critical next step is to extend research focused on the quantity of available food (fish biomass) to also consider its nutritional quality, which is relevant to progress in the fields of food security and malnutrition. Biological traits are robust predictors of fish nutrient content and thus potentially indicate how climate-driven changes are expected to impact nutrient availability within future food webs on coral reefs. Here, we outline future research priorities and an anticipatory framework towards sustainable reef fisheries contributing to nutrition-sensitive food systems in a warming ocean.},

	abstract = {Phthalates ({PAEs}) are of wide concern because they are commonly used in various plastic products as plasticizers, and can found their way into the environment. However, their interaction with the environment and their toxicity in aquatic animals is still a matter of intense debate. In this review on {PAEs} in aquatic environments (lakes, rivers and seas), it is found that there is a large variety and abundance of {PAEs} in developing countries, and the total concentration of {PAEs} even exceeds 200 μg / L. The interaction between metabolic processes involved in the toxicity induced by various {PAEs} is summarized for the first time in the article. Exposure of {PAEs} can lead to activation of the detoxification system {CYP}450 and endocrine system receptors of aquatic animals, which in turn causes oxidative stress, metabolic disorders, endocrine disorders, and immunosuppression. Meanwhile, each system can activate / inhibit each other, causing genotoxicity and cell apoptosis, resulting in the growth and development of organisms being blocked. The mixed {PAEs} shows no cumulative toxicity changes to aquatic animals. For the combined pollution of other chemicals and {PAEs}, {PAE} can act as an agonist or antagonist, leading to combined toxicity in different directions. Phthalate monoesters ({MPEs}), the metabolites of {PAEs}, are also toxic to aquatic animals, however, the toxicity is weaker than the corresponding parent compounds. This review summarizes and analyzes the current ecotoxicological effects of {PAEs} on aquatic animals, and provides guidance for future research.},

	abstract = {Microplastics are widespread emerging marine pollutants that have been found in the coral reef ecosystem. In the present study, using Cladocopium goreaui as a symbiont representative, we investigated cytological, physiological, and molecular responses of a Symbiodiniaceae species to weeklong microplastic exposure (Polystyrene, diameter 1.0 μm, 9.0 × 109 particles L-1). The density and size of algal cells decreased significantly at 7 d and 6-7 d of microplastic exposure, respectively. Chlorophyll a content increased significantly at 7 d of exposure, whereas Fv/Fm did not change significantly during the entire exposure period. We observed significant increases in superoxide dismutase activity and caspase3 activation level, significant decrease in glutathione S-transferase activity, but no change in catalase activity during the whole exposure period. Transcriptomic analysis revealed 191 significantly upregulated and 71 significantly downregulated genes at 7 d after microplastic exposure. Fifteen {GO} terms were overrepresented for these significantly upregulated genes, which were grouped into four categories including transmembrane ion transport, substrate-specific transmembrane transporter activity, calcium ion binding, and calcium-dependent cysteine-type endopeptidase activity. Thirteen of the significantly upregulated genes encode metal ion transporter and ammonium transporter, and five light-harvesting protein genes were among the significantly downregulated genes. These results demonstrate that microplastics can act as an exogenous stressor, suppress detoxification activity, nutrient uptake, and photosynthesis, elevate oxidative stress, and raise the apoptosis level through upregulating ion transport and apoptotic enzymes to repress the growth of C. goreaui. These effects have implications in negative impacts of microplastics on coral-Symbiodiniaceae symbiosis that involves C. goreaui.},

Some of these compounds are added during plastics manufacture, while others adsorb from the surrounding seawater. Concentrations of hydrophobic contaminants adsorbed on plastics showed distinct spatial variations reflecting global pollution patterns. Model calculations and experimental observations consistently show that polyethylene accumulates more organic contaminants than other plastics such as polypropylene and polyvinyl chloride. Both a mathematical model using equilibrium partitioning and experimental data have demonstrated the transfer of contaminants from plastic to organisms. A feeding experiment indicated that {PCBs} could transfer from contaminated plastics to streaked shearwater chicks. Plasticizers, other plastics additives and constitutional monomers also present potential threats in terrestrial environments because they can leach from waste disposal sites into groundwater and/or surface waters. Leaching and degradation of plasticizers and polymers are complex phenomena dependent on environmental conditions in the landfill and the chemical properties of each additive. Bisphenol A concentrations in leachates from municipal waste disposal sites in tropical Asia ranged from sub µg l–1 to mg l–1 and were correlated with the level of economic development.},

All species descriptions and most physiological and infectivity studies of zooxanthellae have been conducted using cultured material. However, few studies have attempted to quantify the representation of cultures isolated from cnidarians to the in hospite zooxanthella populations of the individual host or host species from which they were established. {RFLPs} of small subunit (18S) {rDNA}, internal transcribed spacer ({ITS})-{rDNA} sequence data, and microsatellite analyses were conducted to assess the relatedness between cultured zooxanthellae and the in hospite populations of the individual host or host species from which they were isolated. {RFLP} data demonstrated that cultures may represent either the numerically dominant symbiont or ones present in lower number. {ITS}-{rDNA} sequences from zooxanthella cultures were disconcordant with {ITS}-{rDNA} sequences identified from in hospite zooxanthellae of the same host species, and microsatellites present in in hospite zooxanthella populations were absent from the corresponding cultures. Finally, reexamination of the literature revealed examples of zooxanthella cultures being nonrepresentative of in hospite populations. These data suggest that, in most cases, cultures are a subset of the original in hospite population. Factors such as failing to homogenize bulk cultures before transfer, growth medium used, and the picking of single motile cells may contribute to many zooxanthella cultures being nonrepresentative.},

	abstract = {There is increasing scientific and public concern over the presence of microplastics in the natural environment. We present the results of a systematic review of the literature to assess the weight of evidence for microplastics causing environmental harm. We conclude that microplastics do occur in surface water and sediments. Fragments and fibers predominate, with beads making up only a small proportion of the detected microplastic types. Concentrations detected are orders of magnitude lower than those reported to affect endpoints such as biochemistry, feeding, reproduction, growth, tissue inflammation and mortality in organisms. The evidence for microplastics acting as a vector for hydrophobic organic compounds to accumulate in organisms is also weak. The available data therefore suggest that these materials are not causing harm to the environment. There is, however, a mismatch between the particle types, size ranges, and concentrations of microplastics used in laboratory tests and those measured in the environment. Select environmental compartments have also received limited attention. There is an urgent need for studies that address this mismatch by performing high quality and more holistic monitoring studies alongside more environmentally realistic effects studies. Only then will we be able to fully characterize risks of microplastics to the environment to support the introduction of regulatory controls that can make a real positive difference to environmental quality.

	abstract = {Given the ubiquitous presence of microplastics in aquatic environments, an evaluation of their toxicity is essential. Microplastics are a heterogeneous set of materials that differ not only in particle properties, like size and shape, but also in chemical composition, including polymers, additives and side products. Thus far, it remains unknown whether the plastic chemicals or the particle itself are the driving factor for microplastic toxicity. To address this question, we exposed Daphnia magna for 21 days to irregular polyvinyl chloride ({PVC}), polyurethane ({PUR}) and polylactic acid ({PLA}) microplastics as well as to natural kaolin particles in high concentrations (10, 50, 100, 500 mg/L, ≤ 59 μm) and different exposure scenarios, including microplastics and microplastics without extractable chemicals as well as the extracted and migrating chemicals alone. All three microplastic types negatively affected the life-history of D. magna. However, this toxicity depended on the endpoint and the material. While {PVC} had the largest effect on reproduction, {PLA} reduced survival most effectively. The latter indicates that bio-based and biodegradable plastics can be as toxic as their conventional counterparts. The natural particle kaolin was less toxic than microplastics when comparing numerical concentrations. Importantly, the contribution of plastic chemicals to the toxicity was also plastic type-specific. While we can attribute effects of {PVC} to the chemicals used in the material, effects of {PUR} and {PLA} plastics were induced by the mere particle. Our study demonstrates that plastic chemicals can drive microplastic toxicity. This highlights the importance of considering the individual chemical composition of plastics when assessing their environmental risks. Our results suggest that less studied polymer types, like {PVC} and {PUR}, as well as bioplastics are of particular toxicological relevance and should get a higher priority in ecotoxicological studies.},

This study examined late larval development and the acquisition of zooxanthellae in the scleractinian coral Fungin scutaria, which produces planula larvae that lack zooxanthellae. Larvae reared under laboratory conditions developed the ability to feed 3 days after fertilization; feeding behavior was stimulated by homogenized Artemia. Larvae began to settle and metamorphose 5 days after fertilization. In laboratory experiments, larvae acquired experimentally added zooxanthellae by ingesting them while feeding. Zooxanthellae entered the gastric cavity and were phagocytosed by endodermal cells. As early as 1 h after feeding, zooxanthellae were observed in both endodermal and ectodermal cells. Larvae were able to form an association with three genetically distinct strains of zooxanthellae. Both zooxanthellateandazooxanthellatelarvaeunderwentmetamorphosis,andazooxanthellatepolypswereabletoacquire zooxanthellae from the environment. Preliminary evidence suggests that the onset of symbiosis may influence larval development; in one study symbiotic larvae settled earlier than aposymbiotic larvae. Protein profiles of eggs and larvae throughout development revealed a putative yolk protein doublet that was abundant in eggs and 1 -day-old larvae and was absent by day 6.

Each event occurred in the evening between 1700 and 1900 hours 1 to 4 days following the full moon. Fungia scutaria exhibits gonochorism. Females ejected eggs through their mouths into the seawater above. Many of these negatively buoyant eggs settled onto the oral discs and were moved off the edge by ciliary-mucoid activity. Spermatoza from males were similarly expelled in a jet of gastrovascular fluid. Spawned eggs were small and lacked endosymbiotic zooxanthellae. Rapid development led to ciliated solid planulae by the next morning. Within 24 h a mouth had begun to develop. Planulae may have been able to feed within 39 h. Infection with zooxanthellae occurred 4–5 days following spawning. Planulae may have become competent for settlement by 7 days, but attempts to docment settlement produced ambiguous results.},

	abstract = {Background Corals, which form the foundation of biodiverse reef ecosystems, are under threat from warming oceans. Reefs provide essential ecological services, including food, income from tourism, nutrient cycling, waste removal, and the absorption of wave energy to mitigate erosion. Here, we studied the coral thermal stress response using network methods to analyze transcriptomic and polar metabolomic data generated from the Hawaiian rice coral Montipora capitata. Coral nubbins were exposed to ambient or thermal stress conditions over a 5-week period, coinciding with a mass spawning event of this species. The major goal of our study was to expand the inventory of thermal stress-related genes and metabolites present in M. capitata and to study gene-metabolite interactions. These interactions provide the foundation for functional or genetic analysis of key coral genes as well as provide potentially diagnostic markers of pre-bleaching stress. A secondary goal of our study was to analyze the accumulation of sex hormones prior to and during mass spawning to understand how thermal stress may impact reproductive success in M. capitata. Methods M. capitata was exposed to thermal stress during its spawning cycle over the course of 5 weeks, during which time transcriptomic and polar metabolomic data were collected. We analyzed these data streams individually, and then integrated both data sets using {MAGI} (Metabolite Annotation and Gene Integration) to investigate molecular transitions and biochemical reactions. Results Our results reveal the complexity of the thermal stress phenome in M. capitata, which includes many genes involved in redox regulation, biomineralization, and reproduction. The size and number of modules in the gene co-expression networks expanded from the initial stress response to the onset of bleaching. The later stages involved the suppression of metabolite transport by the coral host, including a variety of sodium-coupled transporters and a putative ammonium transporter, possibly as a response to reduction in algal productivity. The gene-metabolite integration data suggest that thermal treatment results in the activation of animal redox stress pathways involved in quenching molecular oxygen to prevent an overabundance of reactive oxygen species. Lastly, evidence that thermal stress affects reproductive activity was provided by the downregulation of {CYP}-like genes and the irregular production of sex hormones during the mass spawning cycle. Overall, redox regulation and metabolite transport are key components of the coral animal thermal stress phenome. Mass spawning was highly attenuated under thermal stress, suggesting that global climate change may negatively impact reproductive behavior in this species.},

	abstract = {Background: Maternal {mRNA} provisioning of oocytes regulates early embryogenesis. Maternal transcripts are degraded as zygotic genome activation ({ZGA}) intensifies, a phenomenon known as the maternal-to-zygotic transition ({MZT}). Here, we examine gene expression over nine developmental stages in the Pacific rice coral, Montipora capitata, from eggs and embryos at 1, 4, 9, 14, 22, and 36 h-post-fertilization (hpf), as well as swimming larvae (9d), and adult colonies.
Results: Weighted Gene Coexpression Network Analysis revealed four expression peaks, identifying the maternal complement, two waves of the {MZT}, and adult expression. Gene ontology enrichment revealed maternal {mRNAs} are dominated by cell division, methylation, biosynthesis, metabolism, and protein/{RNA} processing and transport functions. The first {MZT} wave occurs from {\textasciitilde}4-14 hpf and is enriched in terms related to biosynthesis, methylation, cell division, and transcription. In contrast, functional enrichment in the second {MZT} wave, or {ZGA}, from 22 hpf9dpf, includes ion/peptide transport and cell signaling. Finally, adult expression is enriched for functions related to signaling, metabolism, and ion/peptide transport. Our proposed {MZT} timing is further supported by expression of enzymes involved in zygotic transcriptional repression (Kaiso) and activation (Sox2), which peak at 14 hpf and 22 hpf, respectively. Further, {DNA} methylation writing ({DNMT}3a) and removing ({TET}1) enzymes peak and remain stable past {\textasciitilde}4 hpf, suggesting that methylome programming occurs before 4 hpf.
Conclusions: Our high-resolution insight into the coral maternal {mRNA} and {MZT} provides essential baseline information to understand parental carryover effects and the sensitivity of developmental success under increasing environmental stress.},

	abstract = {Wildlife can be exposed to chemicals in the environment from various anthropogenic sources. Ecotoxicity studies, undertaken to address the risks from potential exposure to chemicals, vary in their design e.g. duration of exposure, effect types and endpoints measured. Ecotoxicity studies measure biological responses to test item exposure. Responses can be highly variable, with limited opportunity for control of extrinsic sources of variability. It is critical to distinguish between treatment-related effects and background ‘normal variability’ when interpreting results. Historical control data ({HCD}) can be a valuable tool in contextualising results from single studies against previous studies performed under similar conditions. This paper discusses the case for better use of {HCD} in ecotoxicology assessments, illustrating with case studies the value and difficulties of using {HCD} in interpretation of results of standard and higher-tier study designs. {HCD} are routinely used in mammalian toxicology for human health assessments, but not directly in ecotoxicology. The possible reasons for this are discussed e.g., different data types, the potential to mask effects, and the lack of guidance. These concerns are real but not insurmountable and we would like to see organisations such as {OECD}, {EFSA} and {USEPA} develop guidance on the principles of {HCD} collection. Hopefully, this would lead to greater use of {HCD} and regulatory acceptance. We believe this is not only a scientifically valid approach but also an ethical issue that is in line with societally driven legal mandates to minimise the use of vertebrate testing in chemical regulatory decision making.},

The goals of the present review are to assess the state of the science regarding toxicological effects of {PFAS} and to develop strategies for advancing knowledge on the health effects of this large family of chemicals. Currently, much of the toxicity data available for {PFAS} are for a handful of chemicals, primarily legacy {PFAS} such as perfluorooctanoic acid and perfluorooctane sulfonate. Epidemiological studies have revealed associations between exposure to specific {PFAS} and a variety of health effects, including altered immune and thyroid function, liver disease, lipid and insulin dysregulation, kidney disease, adverse reproductive and developmental outcomes, and cancer. Concordance with experimental animal data exists for many of these effects. However, information on modes of action and adverse outcome pathways must be expanded, and profound differences in {PFAS} toxicokinetic properties must be considered in understanding differences in responses between the sexes and among species and life stages. With many health effects noted for a relatively few example compounds and hundreds of other {PFAS} in commerce lacking toxicity data, more contemporary and high-throughput approaches such as read-across, molecular dynamics, and protein modeling are proposed to accelerate the development of toxicity information on emerging and legacy {PFAS}, individually and as mixtures. In addition, an appropriate degree of precaution, given what is already known from the {PFAS} examples noted, may be needed to protect human health.},

The solitary coral Fungia scutaria Lamarck 1801 harbors a single algal strain, Symbiodinium {ITS}2 type C1f (homologous strain) during adulthood. Previous studies have shown that distinct algal {ITS}2 types in clade C correlate with F. scutaria—Symbiodinium specificity during the onset of symbiosis in the larval stage. The present study examined the early specificity events in the onset of symbiosis between F. scutaria larvae and Symbiodinium spp., by looking at the temporal and spatial infection dynamics of larvae challenged with different symbiont types. The results show that specificity at the onset of symbiosis was mediated by recognition events during the initial symbiont—host physical contact before phagocytosis, and by subsequent cellular events after the symbionts were incorporated into host cells. Moreover, homologous and heterologous Symbiodinium sp. strains did not exhibit the same pattern of localization within larvae. When larvae were infected with homologous symbionts (C1f), {\textasciitilde}70\% of the total acquired algae were found in the equatorial area of the larvae, between the oral and aboral ends, 21 h after inoculation. In contrast, no spatial difference in algal localization was observed in larvae infected with heterologous symbionts. This result provides evidence of functional differences among gastrodermal cells, during development of the larvae. The cells in the larval equator function as nutritive phagocytes, and also appear to function as a region of enhanced symbiont acquisition in F. scutaria.},

Fundamental assumptions of the {ABH} include (1) different types of zooxanthellae respond differently to environmental conditions, specifically temperature, and (2) bleached adults can secondarily acquire zooxanthellae from the environment. We present simple tests of these assumptions and show that (1) genetically different strains of zooxanthellae exhibit different responses to elevated temperature, (2) bleached adult hosts can acquire algal symbionts with an apparently dose-dependent relationship between the concentration of zooxanthellae and the rate of establishment of the symbiosis, (3) and finally, bleached adult hosts can acquire symbionts from the water column.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          
            Thermal tolerance is variable in corals, yet intrinsic and extrinsic drivers of tolerance are not well understood. Understanding the distribution and abundance of heat tolerant corals across seascapes is imperative for predicting responses to climate change and to support novel management actions. Rapid and high-throughput methods
            
            to measure heat-induced coral bleaching sensitivity are increasingly required to understand current and predict future responses to climate change. Experimental evaluations of coral heat and bleaching tolerance typically involve ramp-and-hold experiments run across days to weeks within aquarium facilities with limits to colony replication. Field-based acute heat stress assays have emerged as an alternative experimental approach to rapidly quantify heat tolerance in a large number of samples yet the role of key methodological considerations on the stress response measured remains unresolved. Here, we quantify the effects of coral fragment size, sampling time point, and physiological measures on the acute heat stress response in adult corals. The effect of fragment size differed between species (
            Acropora tenuis
            and
            Pocillopora damicornis
            ). Most physiological parameters measured here declined over time (tissue colour, chlorophyll-a and protein content) from the onset of heating, with the exception of maximum photosynthetic efficiency (
            F
            
              v
            
            /

              m
            
            ), which was stable up to 24h post heating. Based on our experiments, we identified photosynthetic efficiency, tissue colour change, and host-specific assays such as catalase activity as key physiological measures for rapid quantification of thermal tolerance. We recommend that future applications of acute heat stress assays include larger fragments ({\textgreater}9cm
            2
            ) where possible and sample between 10 - 14h after the end of heat stress. A validated high-throughput experimental approach combined with cost-effective genomic and physiological measurements underpins the development of markers and maps of heat tolerance across seascapes and ocean warming scenarios.},

Recent progress in extreme biomimetics has offered a brand-new springboard for the materials and engineering communities to reshuffle traditional approaches for designing of biopolymers-based composites at ambient conditions. Partially, this modern scientific direction refers to the utilization of thermostable, pressure and chemically resistant biopolymers, found in biologically extreme environments, for the in-vitro preparation of novel inorganic-organic composite materials. This field informs fundamental questions about the mechanisms and principles of biomineralization processes also in extreme environments. The first part of this review focuses on extreme biomineralization among psychrophilic, hydrothermal, alkaliphilic and halophilic organisms. In the second part, we discuss analysis of selected biopolymers of plant (cellulose) and animal (chitin, chitosan, silk, spongin) origin, which are thermostable and resistant to chemically harsh laboratory conditions. Special attention has been focused on carbonization of selected biomaterials. Finally, we take the liberty to discuss the perspectives underlying intriguing experimental scenarious within extreme biomimetics.},

We investigated the effect of warmer water and lower {pH} conditions—projected for New Zealand coastal waters at the start of the next century—on both phytoplankton and zooplankton in a 20 d mesocosm experiment to determine whether amino acid stable isotopes could be used as biomarkers of environmental change. We also assessed whether key environmental drivers, such as those linked to climate change, altered the processing of amino acids at the base of the food web. Despite changes in phytoplankton biomass and community composition, we found no significant difference in either particulate organic matter ({POM}) bulk or amino acid-specific δ15N values, indicating that the trophic status of {POM} was not significantly influenced by lower {pH} and warming. Threonine δ15N values were the most sensitive to changes in the phytoplankton community and showed correlations with diatoms (positive) and small flagellates (negative), demonstrating potential as a biomarker for detecting changes related to these phytoplankton groups and thus making threonine a promising indirect indicator of climate change. Finally, δ15NPhe values tracked changes in the lower food web, likely due to faster turnover times, showing its valuable role as a tracer of the nitrogen baseline, even during accelerated metabolism in zooplankton.},

At present, there is no mechanism to support carbon ﬁnancing linked to seagrass. For seagrasses to be recognised by the {IPCC} and the voluntary C market, standard stock assessment methodologies and inventories of seagrass C stocks are required. Developing accurate C budgets for seagrass meadows is indeed complex; we discuss these complexities, and, in addition, we review techniques and methodologies that will aid development of C budgets. We also consider a simple process-based data assimilation model for predicting how seagrasses will respond to future change, accompanied by a practical list of research priorities.},

To investigate sources, backward air mass trajectories were run from the time of sampling. These indicate potential long-range transportation of up to 6000 km, assuming a residence time of 6.5 d. Local sources were also identified as potential inputs into the environment as the polymers identified were consistent with those used in clothing and equipment from nearby research stations. This study adds to the growing body of literature regarding microplastics as a ubiquitous airborne pollutant and establishes their presence in Antarctica.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Intertidal macroalgae are exposed to many biotic and abiotic stressors, including significant fluctuations in environmental parameters such as salinity, temperature, {pH} and solar radiation. This study characterized populations of the intertidal calcifying red alga Corallina officinalis across its geographic distribution in the North-east Atlantic. Processes examined included primary production, respiration, light and dark calcification, photosynthesis-irradiance, and calcification-irradi­ ance evolution. Results confirmed significant differences in the physiology of C. officinalis between latitudes with a clear north-to-south gradient. Compared with central and southern populations of this species, northern populations appeared to be the most robust, showing potential for local physiological adaptation in response to increased variability in environ­ mental factors present within their habitat. Conversely, southern populations displayed a distinct lack of local adaptation compared with northern populations. This is possibly due to southern populations being located within an environment at the upper limit of their stress tolerance, therefore restricting the species’ ability to adapt. As a result, future permanent decline, or even disappearance, of C. officinalis within southern locations of the North-east Atlantic could occur, a process that is likely to be accelerated by predicted future climatic changes. Furthermore, given the essential role these ecosystem engineers play within their habitat, any loss of C. officinalis is also expected to have a strongly negative impact on the surrounding environment.},

	abstract = {Plastics of various chemistries pollute global water bodies. Toxic chemicals leach with detrimental and often unpredictable impacts on the surrounding ecosystems. We found that seawater leachates of plastic pre-production pellets from 7 recycle categories are acutely toxic to stage {II} barnacle nauplii; lethal concentration 50 ({LC}50s) were observed in 24-h leachates from dilutions ranging from 0.007 to 2.1 mg/{mL} of seawater. Based on previous observations that macro-organismal settlement on fouling management coatings of various toxicities can be used to predict the toxicity of the coating, we hypothesized that interaction of plastic pre-production pellets with emerging microbiomes would exhibit patterns indicative of the chemistry at the pellet surface. We used amplicon sequencing of bacterial 16S ribosomal {RNA} genes to characterize the microbiomes that developed from 8 through 70 days on pellets exposed to the same flowing ambient seawater. Diversity and composition of the microbiomes colonizing plastic pellets changed over time and varied with plastic type. Microbial taxa belong to taxonomic groups known to consume hydrocarbons, to be prevalent following marine oil spills, or to live on fouling management surfaces. Microbiomes were still distinct between plastic types at Day 70, suggesting that differences in the physicochemical characteristics of the underlying plastics continue to exert variable selection of surface microbial communities. A random forest-based sample classifier correctly predicted 93\% of plastic types using microbiome compositions. Surface microbiomes have promise for use in forensically identifying plastic types and potential toxicities.},

However, steam autoclaves typically used for this purpose may not be readily accessible to everyone in the scientific community, such as K-12 teachers, researchers in the field, students in under-funded laboratories, or persons in the developing world who lack funding and resources. This work examines the use of commercial electric pressure cookers as an alternative method for the sterilization of media, instruments, and waste. Four commonly available brands of pressure cooker were tested for their ability to sterilize microbiological media, a variety of metal instruments, and high-titer microbial cultures. All four pressure cookers were able to sterilize these starting materials as well as a range of microbial types, including Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, filamentous fungi, unicellular fungi, and mixed environmental samples. Only the Instant Pot, however, was able to sterilize autoclave tester ampoules of Geobacillus stearothermophilus spores. These results suggest that, depending on the nature of the work undertaken, store-bought pressure cookers can be an appropriate substitute for commercial autoclaves. Their adoption may also help increase the accessibility of science to a broader range of investigators.},

While the ultimate causes of bleaching are well understood, the proximate physiological mechanisms underlying the bleaching response are not as well defined. Here we measured nitric oxide synthase activity, oxidative stress, and cell death in algal symbionts (Symbiodinaceae) freshly isolated from the reef-building coral Pocillopora acuta collected in the field under natural non-bleaching conditions and from corals experimentally exposed to elevated temperatures. Nitric oxide synthase activity in the algal symbionts was {\textgreater}3 orders of magnitude higher than that of the host and increased dramatically with increasing temperature and time of exposure (up to 72 h), consistent with the onset of bleaching for these corals. Oxidative stress and cell death among the algal symbionts were highest in coral holobionts exposed to intermediate as opposed to maximal temperatures, suggesting that these mechanisms are not proximal triggers for bleaching in this species. Our results point to nitric oxide production by the algal symbionts, rather than symbiont dysfunction, as a more important driver of coral bleaching under acute thermal stress in this coral.},

The maximum concentration was encountered in a Pocillopora verrucosa colony sampled from a shallow inner reef (8.9 particles/g of coral).

	abstract = {In Nannochloropsis oceanica, betaine lipid is not only important as a surrogate for phospholipids during phosphate deficiency, but is also required for adaptation to low temperature conditions., Diacylglyceryl-N,N,N-trimethylhomo-Ser ({DGTS}) is a nonphosphorous, polar glycerolipid that is regarded as analogous to the phosphatidylcholine in bacteria, fungi, algae, and basal land plants. In some species of algae, including the stramenopile microalga Nannochloropsis oceanica, {DGTS} contains an abundance of eicosapentaenoic acid ({EPA}), which is relatively scarce in phosphatidylcholine, implying that {DGTS} has a unique physiological role. In this study, we addressed the role of {DGTS} in N. oceanica. We identified two {DGTS} biosynthetic enzymes that have distinct domain configurations compared to previously identified {DGTS} synthases. Mutants lacking {DGTS} showed growth retardation under phosphate starvation, demonstrating a pivotal role for {DGTS} in the adaptation to this condition. Under normal conditions, {DGTS} deficiency led to an increase in the relative amount of monogalactosyldiacylglycerol, a major plastid membrane lipid with high {EPA} content, whereas excessive production of {DGTS} induced by gene overexpression led to a decrease in monogalactosyldiacylglycerol. Meanwhile, lipid analysis of partial phospholipid-deficient mutants revealed a role for phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine in {EPA} biosynthesis. These results suggest that {DGTS} and monogalactosyldiacylglycerol may constitute the two major pools of {EPA} in extraplastidic and plastidic membranes, partially competing to acquire {EPA} or its precursors derived from phospholipids. The mutant lacking {DGTS} also displayed impaired growth and a lower proportion of {EPA} in extraplastidic compartments at low temperatures. Our results indicate that {DGTS} is involved in the adaptation to low temperatures through a mechanism that is distinct from the {DGTS}-dependent adaptation to phosphate starvation in N. oceanica.},

              Crustose coralline red algae ({CCA}) play a key role in the consolidation of many modern tropical coral reefs. It is unclear, however, if their function as reef consolidators was equally pronounced in the geological past. Using a comprehensive database on ancient reefs, we show a strong correlation between the presence of {CCA} and the formation of true coral reefs throughout the last 150 Ma. We investigated if repeated breakdowns in the potential capacity of {CCA} to spur reef development were associated with sea level, ocean temperature, {CO}

              concentration, {CCA} species diversity, and/or the evolution of major herbivore groups. Model results show that the correlation between the occurrence of {CCA} and the development of true coral reefs increased with {CCA} diversity and cooler ocean temperatures while the diversification of herbivores had a transient negative effect. The evolution of novel herbivore groups compromised the interaction between {CCA} and true reef growth at least three times in the investigated time interval. These crises have been overcome by morphological adaptations of {CCA}.},

	abstract = {The early effects of heat stress on the photosynthesis of symbiotic dinoflagellates (zooxanthellae) within the tissues of a reef-building coral were examined using pulse-amplitude-modulated ({PAM}) chlorophyll fluorescence and photorespirometry. Exposure of Stylophora pistillata to 33 and 34 °C for 4 h resulted in (1) the development of strong non-photochemical quenching ({qN}) of the chlorophyll fluorescence signal, (2) marked decreases in photosynthetic oxygen evolution, and (3) decreases in optimal quantum yield (Fv/Fm) of photosystem {II} ({PSII}). Quantum yield decreased to a greater extent on the illuminated surfaces of coral branches than on lower (shaded) surfaces, and also when high irradiance intensities were combined with elevated temperature (33 °C as opposed to 28 °C). {qN} collapsed in heat-stressed samples when quenching analysis was conducted in the absence of oxygen. Collectively, these observations are interpreted as the initiation of photoprotective dissipation of excess absorbed energy as heat ({qN}) and O2-dependent electron flow through the Mehler-Ascorbate-Peroxidase cycle ({MAP}-cycle) following the point at which the rate of light-driven electron transport exceeds the capacity of the Calvin cycle. A model for coral bleaching is proposed whereby the primary site of heat damage in S. pistillata is carboxylation within the Calvin cycle, as has been observed during heat damage in higher plants. Damage to {PSII} and a reduction in Fv/Fm (i.e. photoinhibition) are secondary effects following the overwhelming of photoprotective mechanisms by light. This secondary factor increases the effect of the primary variable, temperature. Potential restrictions of electron flow in heat-stressed zooxanthellae are discussed with respect to Calvin cycle enzymes and the unusual status of the dinoflagellate Rubisco. Significant features of our model are that (1) damage to {PSII} is not the initial step in the sequence of heat stress in zooxanthellae, and (2) light plays a key secondary role in the initiation of the bleaching phenomena.},

	abstract = {The reported toxicity of oxybenzone-based sunscreens to corals has raised concerns about the impacts of ecotourist-shed sunscreens on corals already weakened by global stressors. However, oxybenzone’s toxicity mechanism(s) are not understood, hampering development of safer sunscreens. We found that oxybenzone caused high mortality of a sea anemone under simulated sunlight including ultraviolet ({UV}) radiation (290 to 370 nanometers). Although oxybenzone itself protected against {UV}-induced photo-oxidation, both the anemone and a mushroom coral formed oxybenzone–glucoside conjugates that were strong photo-oxidants. Algal symbionts sequestered these conjugates, and mortality correlated with conjugate concentrations in animal cytoplasm. Higher mortality in anemones that lacked symbionts suggests an enhanced risk from oxybenzone to corals bleached by rising temperatures. Because many commercial sunscreens contain structurally related chemicals, understanding metabolite phototoxicity should facilitate the development of coral-safe products.

            Sunscreen turned toxic
            
              Coral reefs face many serious threats from human activity. Sunscreens can cause reef damage, and although the precise mechanisms involved are still under study, some localities have already phased out common components such as oxybenzone. Using a sea anemone as a model system, Vuckovic
              et al
              . found that oxybenzone is modified within cells by attachment of glucose, turning it from a sunscreen into a potent photosensitizer (see the Perspective by Hansel). The glycoside conjugate is concentrated within the algal symbionts of anemones and corals, and bleached anemones are more susceptible to damage when exposed to ultraviolet light and oxybenzone, suggesting that the algae provide some protection to their hosts. These experiments add to our understanding of reef damage by sunscreens and may help to inform policy and new sunscreen development. —{MAF}

In the two-day exposure, P. clivosa ingested a higher number of microspheres ranging in size from 425 mme2.8 mm than A. cervicornis. Both species egested the majority of microspheres within 48 h of ingestion. In the long-term exposure, calciﬁcation and tissue surface area were negatively affected in the treatment group of both species. Exposure also negatively affected buoyant weight in A. cervicornis but not in P. clivosa.

Scler­ actinian corals are the foundation species of coral reef ecosystems that are greatly affected by the microplastics ({MPs}), yet little is known about the effects of microplastics on the coral azooxanthellate. In the present study, effects of the exposure and ingestion of polyvinyl chloride ({PVC}), polyethylene ({PE}), polyethylene terephthalate ({PET}), and polyamide 66 ({PA}66) were studied on the physiological responses of Tubastrea aurea. Our results shows that coral ingested microplastics in four treatment groups and the exposure of microplastics inhibited the antioxidant capacity, immune system, calcification and energy metabolism of the coral Tubastrea aurea. Super­ oxide dismutase ({SOD}), catalase ({CAT}), alkaline phosphatase ({AKP}), and total antioxidant capacity ({TAC}) were reduced by 29.4\%, 35.5\%, 73.9\%, and 52.2\% in the corals exposed to {PVC}, respectively. {PET} microplastics impacted more severely on pyruvate kinase ({PK}), Na, K-{ATPase} (Na, K-{ATP}), Ca-{ATPase} (Ca-{ATP}), Mg-{ATPase} (Mg-{ATP}), Ca-Mg-{ATPase} (Ca, Mg-{ATP}), and glutathione ({GSH}). Activity of these enzymes decreases to 89.6\%, 66.7\%, 63.6\%, 60.4\%, 48.4\%, and 50.5\% respectively.

Physiological mechanisms connecting multiple polyps and integrating them into a coral colony are still enigmatic. Using live imaging, particle tracking, and mathematical modeling, we reveal how corals connect individual polyps and form integrated polyp groups via species-speciﬁc, complex, and stable networks of currents at their surface. These currents involve surface mucus of different concentrations, which regulate joint feeding of the colony. Inside the coral, within the gastrovascular system, we expose the complexity of bidirectional branching streams that connect individual polyps. This system of canals extends the surface area by 4-fold and might improve communication, nutrient supply, and symbiont transfer. Thus, individual polyps integrate via complex liquid dynamics on the surface and inside the colony.},

The primary drivers of this phenomenon are the inherent genetic variability in the Family Symbiodiniaceae, and the variability in the abiotic environment for variables such as irradiance and temperature. Recent experiments have either disregarded the important interactive role of irradiance or have suggested that photooxidative stress is not a prerequisite for coral bleaching because certain reactive oxygen species ({ROS}) can be produced in the dark. Here, fluorescent probes are used as proxies for the relative concentration of {ROS} in different genera of cultured Symbiodiniaceae under varying thermal and light conditions. The results show that taxon-specific patterns of the concentration of {ROS} are observed but that all genera tested produced significantly greater amounts of superoxide radicals and hydrogen peroxide, compared to singlet oxygen, when exposed to high light and thermal stress. These results are contextualized in relation to the primary drivers of {ROS} production and the photo-physiological basis for differences in {ROS} production that may then be correlated with symbiont driven coral bleaching.},

Here, we designed, developed, and validated a {DIver}-operated Submersible Chemiluminescent {sensOr} ({DISCO}), the ﬁrst handheld submersible chemiluminescent sensor. The ﬂuidic system inside {DISCO} is controlled by two high-precision pumps that introduce sample water and analytical reagents into a mixing cell. The resultant chemiluminescent signal is quantiﬁed by a photomultiplier tube, recorded by a miniature onboard computer and monitored in real time via a handheld underwater {LED} interface. Components are contained within a pressure-bearing housing (max depth 30 m), and an external battery pack supplies power. Laboratory calibrations with ﬁltered seawater veriﬁed instrument stability and precision. Field deployment in Cuban coral reefs quantiﬁed background seawater-normalized extracellular superoxide concentrations near coral surfaces (0−173 {nM}) that varied distinctly with coral species. Observations were consistent with previous similar measurements from aquaria and shallow reefs using a standard benchtop system. In situ quantiﬁcation of superoxide associated with corals was enabled by {DISCO}, demonstrating the potential application to other shallow water ecosystems and chemical species.},

Part of this shift in thinking can be attributed to the wide phylogenetic distribution of specialized mechanisms for {ROS} production, such as {NADPH} oxidases, which decouple intracellular and extracellular {ROS} pools by directly catalyzing the reduction of oxygen in the surrounding aqueous environment. Furthermore, biological {ROS} production contributes substantially to natural fluxes of {ROS} in the ocean, thereby influencing the fate of carbon, metals, oxygen, and climate-relevant gases.

	abstract = {The bleaching of corals in response to increases in temperature has resulted in significant coral reef degradation in many tropical marine ecosystems. This bleaching has frequently been attributed to photoinhibition of photosynthetic electron transport and the consequent photodamage to photosystem {II} ({PSII}) and the production of damaging reactive oxygen species ({ROS}) in the zooxanthellae (Symbiodinium spp.). However, these events may be because of perturbations of other processes occurring within the zooxanthellae or the host cells, and consequently constitute only secondary responses to temperature increase. The processes involved with the onset of photoinhibition of electron transport, photodamage to {PSII} and pigment bleaching in coral zooxanthellae are reviewed. Consideration is given to how increases in temperature might lead to perturbations of metabolic processes in the zooxanthellae and/or their host cells, which could trigger events leading to bleaching. It is concluded that production of {ROS} by the thylakoid photosynthetic apparatus in the zooxanthellae plays a major role in the onset of bleaching resulting from photoinhibition of photosynthesis, although it is not clear which particular {ROS} are involved. It is suggested that hydrogen peroxide generated in the zooxanthellae may have a signalling role in triggering the mechanisms that result in expulsion of zooxanthellae from corals.},

	abstract = {As seawater temperature rises, repeated thermal bleaching events have negatively affected the reefs of the Andaman Sea for over decades. Studies on the coral-associated microbial diversity of prokaryotes and microbial eukaryotes (microbiome) in healthy and bleached corals are important to better understand the coral holobionts that involved augmented resistance to stresses, and this information remains limited in the Andaman Sea of Thailand. The present study thereby described the microbiomes of healthy (unbleached) and bleached colonies of four prevalent corals, Acropora humilis , Platygyra sp., Pocillopora damicornis , and Porites lutea , along with the surrounding seawater and sediments, that were collected during a 2016 thermal bleaching event, using 16S and 18S {rRNA} genes next-generation sequencing ({NGS}). Both prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbes showed isolated community profiles among sample types (corals, sediment, and seawater) [analysis of similarities ({ANOSIM}): p = 0.038 for prokaryotes, p {\textless} 0.001 for microbial eukaryotes] and among coral genera ({ANOSIM}: p {\textless} 0.001 for prokaryotes and microbial eukaryotes). In bleached state corals, we found differences in microbial compositions from the healthy state corals. Prevalent differences shared among bleached coral genera (shared in at least three coral genera) included a loss of reported coral-beneficial microbes, such as Pseudomonadales, Alteromonadales, and Symbiodinium ; meanwhile an increase of putative coral-pathogenic Malassezia and Aspergillus . This difference could affect carbon and nitrogen availability for coral growth, reflective of a healthy or bleached state. Our findings in part supported previously microbial dysbiosis knowledge of thermal bleaching coral microbiomes around South East Asia marine geography, and together ongoing efforts are to support the understanding and management of microbial diversity to reduce the negative impacts to corals in massive thermal bleaching events.},

	abstract = {Kelps, brown algae of the order Laminariales, dominate rocky shores and form huge kelp beds which provide habitat and nurseries for various marine organisms. Whereas the basic physiological and ecophysiological characteristics of kelps are well studied, the molecular processes underlying acclimation to different light and temperature conditions are still poorly understood. Therefore we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the physiological acclimation to light and temperature stress. Sporophytes of S. latissima were exposed to combinations of light intensities and temperatures, and microarray hybridizations were performed to determine changes in gene expression patterns. This first large-scale transcriptomic study of a kelp species shows that S. latissima responds to temperature and light stress with a multitude of transcriptional changes: up to 32\% of genes showed an altered expression after the exposure experiments. High temperature had stronger effects on gene expression in S. latissima than low temperature, reflected by the higher number of temperature-responsive genes. We gained insights into underlying molecular processes of acclimation, which includes adjustment of the primary metabolism as well as induction of several {ROS} scavengers and a sophisticated regulation of Hsps. We show that S. latissima, as a cold adapted species, must make stronger efforts for acclimating to high than to low temperatures. The strongest response was caused by the combination of high temperatures with high light intensities, which proved most harmful for the alga.},

	abstract = {The Eastern Bering Sea ﬁshery for pollock is one of the largest ﬁsheries in the world and has often been touted as an example of sustainable ﬁsheries management. Yet, sustainability requires more than protection of the biological productivity of the targeted ﬁsh species. It requires preservation of the ﬂows of net social and economic beneﬁts of the ﬁshery, and ﬂexible governance and management institutions that allow for adaptation to changes in ﬁsh abundance as well as changes in consumer demand and in the prices of key inputs. From an economic perspective, the Alaska pollock ﬁshery was unsustainable before passage of the American Fisheries Act ({AFA}) in 1998. The {AFA} permanently divided the pollock Total Allowable Catch ({TAC}) giving a 10\% allocation to the Community Development Quota ({CDQ}) program and partitioning the remainder among four ﬁshing sectors. It allowed {CDQ} to be leased to any sector but largely prohibited leasing or sale between other sectors. These limits on intersectoral transfers have reduced the ability of sectors to respond to changes in the abundance and distribution of pollock, implementation of management measures intended to beneﬁt other species, and changes in the prices of input factors and products. This paper explores these consequences.},

	abstract = {Many ﬁsheries worldwide have exhibited marked decreases in proﬁtability and ﬁsh stocks during the last few decades as a result of overﬁshing. However, more conservative, science- and incentive-based management approaches have been practiced in the {US} federally managed ﬁsheries off Alaska since the mid-1990s. The Bering Sea pollock ﬁshery is one such ﬁshery and remains one of the world's largest in both value and volume of landings. In 1998, with the implementation of the American Fisheries Act ({AFA}) this ﬁshery was converted from a limited access ﬁshery to a rationalized ﬁshery in which ﬁshing quota were allocated to cooperatives which could transfer quotas, facilitate ﬂeet consolidation, and maximize efﬁciency. The changes in efﬁciency and productivity growth arising from the change in management regime have been the subject of several studies, with a few focusing on the large vessels that both catch and process ﬁsh onboard (catcher-processors). This study modiﬁes existing approaches to account for the unique decision making process characterizing catcherprocessor's production technologies. The focus is on sequential decisions regarding what products to produce and the factors that inﬂuence productivity once those decisions are made, using a multiproduct revenue function. The estimation procedure is based on a latent variable econometric model and departs from and advances previous studies since it deals with the mixed distribution nature of the data, a novel application to ﬁsheries production modeling. The resulting productivity growth estimates are consistent with increasing productivity growth since rationalization of the ﬁshery, even in light of large decreases in the pollock stock. These ﬁndings suggest that rationalizing ﬁshery incentives can help foster improvements in economic productivity even during periods of diminished biological productivity.},

	abstract = {In May 2010 the New England Fishery Management Council introduced a catch share, program in the Northeast Multispecies (groundﬁsh) Fishery. Amendment 16 of the Northeast Multispecies Fishery Management Plan allocated quota to 17 self organized groups of permit holders based on their collective catch history. These groups are commonly referred to as Sectors and are similar to harvest cooperatives. Sectors represented a signiﬁcant shift from previous management approaches reliant on limits to days at sea and other input controls. Given the potential for signiﬁcant social and economic effects of catch shares and other management programs, social and economic performance measures were developed from 2009 to 2010 by Northeast Fisheries Science Center ({NEFSC}) social scientists. Previous social and economic monitoring of management outcomes had been ad hoc and provided minimal opportunity for inter-ﬁshery comparison. This paper describes the process of identifying performance measures and associated indicators to serve as the foundation of monitoring social and economic outcomes for all federal ﬁsheries in the U.S. Northeast Region, and for planning {NEFSC} social and economic research priorities. It then presents how these performance measures were applied to assess the ﬁrst year of the Amendment 16 Sector program. Challenges and limitations of this process are presented along with a description of efforts underway to broaden the use of these social and economic metrics to other ﬁsheries.},

	abstract = {Global seaweed carbon sequestration estimates are currently taken as the fraction of the net primary production ({NPP}) exported to the deep ocean. However, this perspective does not account for {CO}2 from the consumption of external subsidies. Here, we clarify: (i) the role of export relative to seaweed net ecosystem production ({NEP}) for a closed system and one more likely open to subsidies; (ii) the importance of subsidies by compiling published estimates of {NEP} from seaweed-dominated ecosystems; and (iii) discuss their impact on the global seaweed net carbon balance and other sequestration constraints as a mitigation service. Examples of seaweed {NEP} (n = 18) were sparse and variable. Nevertheless, the average {NEP} (−4.0 mmol C m–2 d–1 {SE} ± 12.2) suggested that seaweed ecosystems are a C source, becoming increasingly heterotrophic as their export is consumed. Critically, mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions was mixed relative to their replacement or baseline states, and where {CO}2 is supplied independently of organic metabolism and atmospheric exchange, we caution a sole reliance on {NEP} or {NPP}. This will ensure a more accurate seaweed mitigation assessment, one that does exceed their capacity and is effective within a compliance and carbon trading scheme.},

We measured contaminant concentrations in edible seaweeds (Fucus distichus, F. spiralis, and Nereocystis luetkeana) from 43 locations in the Salish Sea. Metals were analyzed in all samples, and 94 persistent organic pollutants ({POPs}) (i.e. 40 {PCBs}, 15 {PBDEs}, 17 {PCDD}/Fs, and 22 organochlorine pesticides) and 51 {PAHs} were analyzed in Fucus spp. We compared concentrations of contaminants to human health-based screening levels calculated from the {USEPA} and to international limits. We then worked with six focal contaminants that either exceeded screening levels or international limits (Cd, total Hg, Pb, benzo[a]pyrene [{BaP}], and {PCBs}) or are of regional interest (total As). {USEPA} cancer-based screening levels were exceeded in 30 samples for the {PCBs} and two samples for {BaP}. Cadmium concentrations did not exceed the {USEPA} noncancer-based screening level but did exceed international limits at all sites. Lead exceeded international limits at three sites. Because there are no screening levels for total Hg and total As, and to be conservative, we made comparisons to methyl Hg and inorganic As screening levels. All samples were below the methyl Hg and above the inorganic As screening levels. Without knowledge of the As speciation, we cannot assess the health risk associated with the As. While seaweed was the focus, we did not consider contaminant exposure from consuming other foods. Other chemicals, such as contaminants of emerging concern (e.g., {PFAS}, pharmaceuticals and personal care products), should also be considered. Additionally, although we focused on toxicological aspects, there are cultural and health benefits of seaweed use that may affect consumer choice.},

	abstract = {Seaweed aquaculture, the fastest-growing component of global food production, offers a slate of opportunities to mitigate, and adapt to climate change. Seaweed farms release carbon that maybe buried in sediments or exported to the deep sea, therefore acting as a {CO}2 sink. The crop can also be used, in total or in part, for biofuel production, with a potential {CO}2 mitigation capacity, in terms of avoided emissions from fossil fuels, of about 1,500 tons {CO}2 km−2 year−1. Seaweed aquaculture can also help reduce the emissions from agriculture, by improving soil quality substituting synthetic fertilizer and when included in cattle fed, lowering methane emissions from cattle. Seaweed aquaculture contributes to climate change adaptation by damping wave energy and protecting shorelines, and by elevating {pH} and supplying oxygen to the waters, thereby locally reducing the effects of ocean acidification and de-oxygenation. The scope to expand seaweed aquaculture is, however, limited by the availability of suitable areas and competition for suitable areas with other uses, engineering systems capable of coping with rough conditions offshore, and increasing market demand for seaweed products, among other factors. Despite these limitations, seaweed farming practices can be optimized to maximize climate benefits, which may, if economically compensated, improve the income of seaweed farmers.},

	abstract = {The fate of photosynthetic carbon in marine ecosystems dominated by different types of primary producers was examined by compiling published reports on herbivory, autotrophic respiration, decomposition, carbon storage, and export rates as fractions of net primary production ({NPP}) in ecosystems dominated by different types of autotrophs (i.e. oceanic and coastal phytoplankton, microphytobenthos, coral reef algae, macroalgae, seagrasses, marsh plants, and mangroves). A large fraction ({\textgreater}40\%) of the {NPP} of marine ecosystems is decomposed within the system, except for microphytobenthos (decomposition, ∼25\% of {NPP}). Herbivory tends to be highest for microalgae (planktonic and benthic, {\textgreater}40\% of {NPP}) and macroalgae (33.6 ±4.9\% of {NPP}) and is somewhat less for higher plants. Microphytobenthos export on average a much higher proportion of their {NPP} than do other microalgal communities, whereas marine macrophytes, except marsh plants, export a substantial proportion (24.3–43.5\% on average) of their {NPP}. fraction of {NPP} stored in sediments is 4-fold greater for higher plants (∼10–17\% of {NPP}) than for algae (0.4–6\% of {NPP}). On average, ∼90\% of the phytoplankton {NPP} is used to support local heterotrophic metabolism (i.e. grazed or decomposed). This fraction is even higher in oceanic communities. Mangrove forests, and to a lesser extent seagrass meadows and macroalgal beds, produce organic carbon well in excess of the ecosystem requirements, with excess photosynthetic carbon (i.e. export rate plus storage) in these ecosystem representing ∼40\% of {NPP}. Extrapolation of these results to the global ocean identifies marine angiosperms, which only contribute 4\% of total ocean {NPP}, as major contributors of the {NPP} stored (30\% of total ocean carbon storage) and subsequently buried in marine sediments. Consideration of burial of {NPP} from marine angiosperms should lead to estimates of total burial of marine {NPP} that exceed current estimates by 15–50\%.},

	abstract = {In Puget Sound, where the effects of ocean acidification threaten important marine resources, there is a heightened need for investigating mitigation actions. Corrosive conditions associated with acidification are already impacting some calcifiers such as pteropods, crab, and foraminifera1, and laboratory studies further suggest that oysters, crabs, krill, and salmon are also sensitive to the effects of acidification. These species are not only important to the health of the marine ecosystem, but some are highly valued culturally and economically as well. According to the Governor’s Office, in the coming decades, as seawater absorbs increasing amounts of dissolved carbon dioxide, conditions in Washington waters are expected to worsen, with changes occurring “more rapidly in Puget Sound waters than along our coast.” In the face of these deteriorating conditions, we are confronted with many questions, one of which is: what can we do locally - in the water - to ameliorate the effects of acidification? The investigation described in this report sought an answer to that question. Thus began an investigation into whether seaweed cultivation could draw down {CO}2 within the kelp farm and improve conditions for calcifying species. The field study was conducted at a five-acre seaweed and shellfish farm operated by {HCM}, located off Hood Head, just north of the Hood Canal Bridge in Jefferson County, Washington. After acquiring the necessary permits, propagating kelp seed, and outplanting sugar kelp (Saccharina latissima), the team measured the effect of kelp on several metrics of seawater chemistry and on a small suite of calcifying organisms within the kelp farm. Additionally, the team developed a computer model that simulates environmental variables and kelp growth, and then integrates the sampling data into an interface that graphically depicts the effect of kelp cultivation on seawater chemistry. Comb​ined funding from the Paul G. Allen Family Foundation and the U.S. Navy enabled two years of field investigation at the Hood Head demonstration site. Overall, the project was conducted 2015–2019 to test key early actions identified by the Washington State Blue Ribbon Panel on Ocean Acidification.},

	abstract = {The production of marine biomass based on seaweed cultivation is growing rapidly in Europe. One of the major challenges for the development of this new industry is associated with processing of the wet biomass harvested from cultivation sites. Efficient methods for the stabilization (i.e. procedures to maintain the integrity and safety of the biomass) and further processing of large quantities of harvested raw material are still lacking as the development of adapted technologies is often limited by significant capital investment. This study investigates the concept of landing facilities for the processing of cultivated seaweed biomass ({LFCS}) shared among various stakeholders as a practical mean to overcome these challenges. Qualitative data were collected during interviews with relevant stakeholders from Norway and abroad (including seaweed cultivators, technology suppliers and industrial buyers of biomass) to describe the current commercial applications for cultivated seaweeds as well as the methods used for the stabilization and processing of the biomass. This study showed that {LFCS} can give stakeholders the opportunity to share the costs (investment, operational), thus lowering the financial threshold for establishing efficient strategies for processing large quantities of cultivated seaweed biomass. It was identified that such a structure will increase the synergy among industrial actors along the entire value chain to stimulate innovation and facilitate the production of high-quality products from seaweeds to relevant markets (food, animal feed, nutraceuticals and cosmetics). It can also lead to a higher degree of specialization in this new industry. These premises will contribute to increase the profitability of the emerging European seaweed sector. Identification of the appropriate stabilization processes for large-scale production, definition of the role of {LFCS} in the seaweed value chain as well as the mode of engagement of the stakeholders in such structure are thus acknowledged as key considerations to define during the planning phase.},

For thousands of years humanity has seen the oceans as a mysterious, and limitless, source of treasures to be fished, harvested, mined, and salvaged. Now accelerating developments in ocean studies offer a new understanding of the oceans, their role in a global ecosystem, and their vulnerability to threats from human action. Drawing on the latest research, this book offers a fascinating tour of the complex reaches of our ocean world and points the way toward changes that will preserve, rather than squander, the wealth of oceans.},

After decades of overfishing since industrialization, many global fish stocks have recovered, a change brought about through effective management. We provide a synthetic overview of three approaches that managers use to sustain stocks: regulating catch and fishing mortality, regulating effort and regulating spatial access. Within each of these approaches, we describe common restrictions, how they alter incentives to change fishing behaviour, and the resultant ecological, economic and community-­level outcomes. For each approach, we present prominent case-­studies that illustrate behaviour and the corresponding performance. These case-­studies show that sustaining target stocks requires a hard limit on fishing mortality under most conditions, but that additional measures are required to generate economic benefits. Different systems for allocation allow stakeholder communities to strike a locally acceptable balance between profitability and employment.},

Although poor fisheries governance is often implicated, evaluation of solutions remains rare. Bioeconomic theory and case studies suggest that rights-based catch shares can provide individual incentives for sustainable harvest that is less prone to collapse. To test whether catch-share fishery reforms achieve these hypothetical benefits, we have compiled a global database of fisheries institutions and catch statistics in 11,135 fisheries from 1950 to 2003. Implementation of catch shares halts, and even reverses, the global trend toward widespread collapse. Institutional change has the potential for greatly altering the future of global fisheries.},

Incentive-based alternatives (collectively called catch shares) have been shown to generate pecuniary benefits, but little empirical evidence exists for, or against, a link to global fisheries sustainability. We report and expand on an analysis of {\textgreater}11,000 fisheries worldwide, in which we investigated the causes of fisheries collapse from 1950 to 2003. Using a program evaluation design, we found that catch shares prevent and, in some specifications, reverse fisheries collapse. Subsequent scientific studies reinforce and challenge these findings, suggesting fruitful avenues for future research linking incentive-based resource management to sustainability.},

In the present study we used an experimental approach to demonstrate the occurrence of environmental effects on sexual and asexual reproduction, and provide evidence for sexual plasticity and inter-clonal fertilization in laboratory-cultured lines of the sea anemone Aiptasia diaphana. We showed that in A. diaphana, both asexual reproduction by pedal laceration, and sexual reproduction have seasonal components. The rate of pedal laceration was ten-fold higher under summer photoperiod and water temperature conditions than under winter conditions. The onset of gametogenesis coincided with the rising water temperatures occurring in spring, and spawning occurred under parameters that emulated summer photoperiod and temperature conditions. In addition, we showed that under laboratory conditions, asexually produced clones derived from a single founder individual exhibit sexual plasticity, resulting in the development of both male and female individuals. Moreover, a single female founder produced not only males and females but also hermaphrodite individuals. We further demonstrated that A. diaphana can fertilize within and between clone lines, producing swimming planula larvae. These diverse reproductive strategies may explain the species success as invader of artificial marine substrates. We suggest that these diverse reproductive strategies, together with their unique evolutionary position, make Aiptasia diaphana an excellent model for studying the evolution of sex.},

	abstract = {The rice coral, Montipora capitata, is widely distributed throughout the Indo-Pacific and comprises one of the most important reef-building species in the Hawaiian Islands. Here, we describe a de novo assembly of its genome based on a linked-read sequencing approach developed by 10x Genomics. The final draft assembly consisted of 27,870 scaffolds with a N50 size of 186 kb and contained a fairly complete set (81\%) of metazoan benchmarking ({BUSCO}) genes. Based on haploid assembly size (615 Mb) and read k-mer profiles, we estimated the genome size to fall between 600 and 700 Mb, although the high fraction of repetitive sequence introduced considerable uncertainty. Repeat analysis indicated that 42\% of the assembly consisted of interspersed, mostly unclassified repeats, and almost 3\% tandem repeats. We also identified 36,691 protein-coding genes with a median coding sequence length of 807 bp, together spanning 7\% of the assembly. The high repeat content and heterozygosity of the genome proved a challenging scenario for assembly, requiring additional steps to merge haplotypes and resulting in a higher than expected fragmentation at the scaffold level. Despite these challenges, the assembly turned out to be comparable in most quality measures to that of other available coral genomes while being considerably more cost-effective, especially with respect to long-read sequencing methods. Provided high-molecular-weight {DNA} is available, linked-read technology may thus serve as a valuable alternative capable of providing quality genome assemblies of nonmodel organisms.},

Whereas extensive ecological and physiological studies have addressed coral response to environmental stress, high-quality reference genome data are lacking for many of these species. The latter issue hinders efforts to understand the genetic basis of stress resistance and to design informed coral conservation strategies.
{RESULTS}: We report genome assemblies from 4 key Hawaiian coral species, Montipora capitata, Pocillopora acuta, Pocillopora meandrina, and Porites compressa. These species, or members of these genera, are distributed worldwide and therefore of broad scientific and ecological importance. For M. capitata, an initial assembly was generated from short-read Illumina and long-read {PacBio} data, which was then scaffolded into 14 putative chromosomes using Omni-C sequencing. For P. acuta, P. meandrina, and P. compressa, high-quality assemblies were generated using short-read Illumina and long-read {PacBio} data. The P. acuta assembly is from a triploid individual, making it the first reference genome of a nondiploid coral animal.
{CONCLUSIONS}: These assemblies are significant improvements over available data and provide invaluable resources for supporting multiomics studies into coral biology, not just in Hawai'i but also in other regions, where related species exist. The P. acuta assembly provides a platform for studying polyploidy in corals and its role in genome evolution and stress adaptation in these organisms.},

	doi = {10.7717/peerj.12335},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Corals, which form the foundation of biodiverse reef ecosystems, are under threat from warming oceans. Reefs provide essential ecological services, including food, income from tourism, nutrient cycling, waste removal, and the absorption of wave energy to mitigate erosion. Here, we studied the coral thermal stress response using network methods to analyze transcriptomic and polar metabolomic data generated from the Hawaiian rice coral Montipora capitata. Coral nubbins were exposed to ambient or thermal stress conditions over a 5-week period, coinciding with a mass spawning event of this species. The major goal of our study was to expand the inventory of thermal stress-related genes and metabolites present in M. capitata and to study gene-metabolite interactions. These interactions provide the foundation for functional or genetic analysis of key coral genes as well as provide potentially diagnostic markers of pre-bleaching stress. A secondary goal of our study was to analyze the accumulation of sex hormones prior to and during mass spawning to understand how thermal stress may impact reproductive success in M. capitata.
{METHODS}: M. capitata was exposed to thermal stress during its spawning cycle over the course of 5 weeks, during which time transcriptomic and polar metabolomic data were collected. We analyzed these data streams individually, and then integrated both data sets using {MAGI} (Metabolite Annotation and Gene Integration) to investigate molecular transitions and biochemical reactions.
{RESULTS}: Our results reveal the complexity of the thermal stress phenome in M. capitata, which includes many genes involved in redox regulation, biomineralization, and reproduction. The size and number of modules in the gene co-expression networks expanded from the initial stress response to the onset of bleaching. The later stages involved the suppression of metabolite transport by the coral host, including a variety of sodium-coupled transporters and a putative ammonium transporter, possibly as a response to reduction in algal productivity. The gene-metabolite integration data suggest that thermal treatment results in the activation of animal redox stress pathways involved in quenching molecular oxygen to prevent an overabundance of reactive oxygen species. Lastly, evidence that thermal stress affects reproductive activity was provided by the downregulation of {CYP}-like genes and the irregular production of sex hormones during the mass spawning cycle. Overall, redox regulation and metabolite transport are key components of the coral animal thermal stress phenome. Mass spawning was highly attenuated under thermal stress, suggesting that global climate change may negatively impact reproductive behavior in this species.},

To better understand future regional climate change effects on sea surface temperature and salinity, we used empirical downscaling to derive high-resolution time series of future sea surface temperature and salinity in Puget Sound (Washington State, {USA}). Downscaling was based on scenario outputs of two coarse-resolution Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 ({CMIP}6) general circulation models, {GFDL}-{CM}4 and {CNRM}-{CM}6-1-{HR}. We calculated 30-year climatologies for historical and future simulations, calculated the anomalies between historical and future projections, interpolated to a fine-resolution, and applied these downscaled anomalies to a Regional Ocean Modeling System ({ROMS}) time series, yielding short-term and long-term delta-downscaled forecasts. Downscaled output for Puget Sound showed temperature and salinity variability between scenarios and models, but overall, there was a strong model agreement of future surface warming and freshening in Puget Sound. Spatially, we found regional differences for both temperature and salinity, including higher temperatures in South Puget Sound and lower salinity in Whidbey Basin. Interpreting and applying downscaled {CMIP}6 projections of temperature and salinity will help assess climate change vulnerability and inform future ecosystem-based management decisions in Puget Sound and other coastal and estuarine systems.},

	abstract = {Human pressure due to industrial and agricultural development has resulted in a biodiversity crisis. Environmental pollution is one of its drivers, including contamination of wildlife by chemicals emitted into the air, soil, and water. Chemicals released into the environment, even at low concentrations, may pose a negative effect on organisms. These chemicals might modify the synthesis, metabolism, and mode of action of hormones. This can lead to failures in reproduction, growth, and development of organisms potentially impacting their fitness. In this review, we focused on assessing the current knowledge on concentrations and possible effects of endocrine disruptor chemicals (metals, persistent organic pollutants, and others) in studies performed in South America, with findings at reproductive and thyroid levels. Our literature search revealed that most studies have focused on measuring the concentrations of compounds that act as endocrine disruptors in animals at the systemic level. However, few studies have evaluated the effects at a reproductive level, while information at thyroid disorders is scarce. Most studies have been conducted in fish by researchers from Brazil, Argentina, Chile, and Colombia. Comparison of results across studies is difficult due to the lack of standardization of units in the reported data. Future studies should prioritize research on emergent contaminants, evaluate effects on native species and the use of current available methods such as the {OMICs}. Additionally, there is a primary focus on organisms related to aquatic environments, and those inhabiting terrestrial environments are scarce or nonexistent. Finally, we highlight a lack of funding at a national level in the reviewed topic that may influence the observed low scientific productivity in several countries, which is often negatively associated with their percentage of protected areas.},

The diverse and multilayered impacts of plastic on biological health prompts an evaluation of these effects from a One Health perspective, through which the complexity of these processes can be integrated and more clearly understood. Plastic particles ranging from nanometers to meters in size are found throughout every ecosystem on Earth, from the deepest marine trenches to the highest mountains. Plastic waste affects all layers of biological organization, from the molecular and cellular to the organismal, community, and ecosystem-levels. These effects are not only mediated by the physical properties of plastics, but also by the chemical properties of the plastic polymers, the thousands of additives combined with plastics during manufacturing, and the sorbed chemicals and microbes that are transported by the plastic waste. Using a One Health framework we provide an overview of the following themes: 1) ways in which plastic impacts global health across levels of biological organization, 2) how the effects of plastic interact between layers of biology, and 3) what knowledge gaps exist in understanding the effects of plastic within and between biological scales. We also propose potential solutions to address this growing crisis, with an emphasis on One Health perspectives that consider the oneness of animals, humans, and the environment.},

Coral ecosystems are also impacted by local stressors, including microplastics, which are ubiquitous on reefs. While the independent effects of these global and local stressors are well-documented, their interactions remain less explored. Here, we examine the independent and combined effects of global change (ocean warming and acidification) and microplastics exposures on gene expression ({GE}) and microbial community composition in the endangered coral Acropora cervicornis. Nine genotypes were fragmented and maintained in one of four experimental treatments: 1) ambient conditions (ambient seawater, no microplastics; {AMB}); 2) microplastics treatment (ambient seawater, microplastics; {MP}); 3) global change conditions (warm and acidic conditions, no microplastics; {OAW}); and 4) multistressor treatment (warm and acidic conditions with microplastics; {OAW}+{MP}) for 22 days, after which corals were sampled for genome-wide {GE} profiling and {ITS}2 and 16S metabarcoding. Overall A. cervicornis {GE} responses to all treatments were subtle; however, corals in the multistressor treatment exhibited the strongest {GE} responses, and genes associated with innate immunity were overrepresented in this treatment. {ITS}2 analyses confirmed that all coral were associated with Symbiodinium ‘fitti’ and 16S analyses revealed similar microbiomes dominated by the bacterial associate Aquarickettsia, suggesting that these A. cervicornis fragments exhibited remarkably low variability in algal and bacterial community compositions. Future work should focus on functional differences across microbiomes, especially Aquarickettsia and viruses, in these responses. Overall, results suggest that when local stressors are coupled with global change, these interacting stressors present unique challenges to this endangered coral species.},

Our goal was to identify diagnostic markers present early in the bleaching response. From the untargeted {UHPLC}-{MS} data, a variety of co-regulated dipeptides were found that have the highest differential accumulation in both species. The structures of four dipeptides were determined and showed differential accumulation in symbiotic and aposymbiotic (alga-free) populations of the sea anemone Aiptasia (Exaiptasia pallida), suggesting the deep evolutionary origins of these dipeptides and their involvement in symbiosis.

	abstract = {Background Reproductive biology and the evolutionary constraints acting on dispersal stages are poorly understood in many stony coral species. A key piece of missing information is egg and sperm gene expression. This is critical for broadcast spawning corals, such as our model, the Hawaiian species Montipora capitata, because eggs and sperm are exposed to environmental stressors during dispersal. Furthermore, parental effects such as transcriptome investment may provide a means for cross- or trans-generational plasticity and be apparent in egg and sperm transcriptome data. Methods Here, we analyzed M. capitata egg and sperm transcriptomic data to address three questions: (1) Which pathways and functions are actively transcribed in these gametes? (2) How does sperm and egg gene expression differ from adult tissues? (3) Does gene expression differ between these gametes? Results We show that egg and sperm display surprisingly similar levels of gene expression and overlapping functional enrichment patterns. These results may reflect similar environmental constraints faced by these motile gametes. We find significant differences in differential expression of egg vs. adult and sperm vs. adult {RNA}-seq data, in contrast to very few examples of differential expression when comparing egg vs. sperm transcriptomes. Lastly, using gene ontology and {KEGG} orthology data we show that both egg and sperm have markedly repressed transcription and translation machinery compared to the adult, suggesting a dependence on parental transcripts. We speculate that cell motility and calcium ion binding genes may be involved in gamete to gamete recognition in the water column and thus, fertilization.},

	abstract = {Scleractinian corals are a vital component of coral reef ecosystems, and of significant cultural and economic value worldwide. As anthropogenic and natural stressors are contributing to a global decline of coral reefs, understanding coral health is critical to help preserve these ecosystems. Growth anomaly ({GA}) is a coral disease that has significant negative impacts on coral biology, yet our understanding of its etiology and pathology is lacking. In this study we used {RNA}-seq along with de novo metatranscriptome assembly and homology assignment to identify coral genes that are expressed in three distinct coral tissue types: tissue from healthy corals (“healthy”), {GA} lesion tissue from diseased corals (“{GA}-affected”) and apparently healthy tissue from diseased corals (“{GA}-unaffected”). We conducted pairwise comparisons of gene expression among these three tissue types to identify genes and pathways that help us to unravel the molecular pathology of this coral disease. The quality-filtered de novo-assembled metatranscriptome contained 76,063 genes, of which 13,643 were identified as putative coral genes. Overall gene expression profiles of coral genes revealed high similarity between healthy tissue samples, in contrast to high variance among diseased samples. This indicates {GA} has a variety of genetic effects at the colony level, including on seemingly healthy ({GA}-unaffected) tissue. A total of 105 unique coral genes were found differentially expressed among tissue types. Pairwise comparisons revealed the greatest number of differentially expressed genes between healthy and {GA}-affected tissue (93 genes), followed by healthy and {GA}-unaffected tissue (33 genes), and {GA}-affected and -unaffected tissue (7 genes). The putative function of these genes suggests {GA} is associated with changes in the activity of genes involved in developmental processes and activation of the immune system. This is one of the first transcriptome-level studies to investigate coral {GA}, and the first metatranscriptome assembly for the M. capitata holobiont. The gene expression data, metatranscriptome assembly and methodology developed through this study represent a significant addition to the molecular information available to further our understanding of this coral disease.},

Although widespread throughout Alaska, the highest numbers of such events occurred in the southeastern Bering Sea. Killer whales of the resident ecotype feeding on catch or discarded catch and fishermen using whale deterrence measures represented 96\% (number of interactions [n]=3110) of all interactions examined in this study (n=3245). We found that 87\% (n=2817) of all interactions occurred during longline operations. Both minor and serious injuries were documented. Twenty-­ seven killer whales were reported dead, but additional mortalities are assumed. Most whales killed were residents; however, 3 transient whales were also taken. Because killer whale populations are relatively small, a low level of mortality may significantly affect populations, especially if multiple sympatric stocks are shown to exist. Given the long history (i.e., over 6 decades) that Alaska killer whales have had with fishing operations, it is likely that these interactions will continue.},

	abstract = {Killer whale (Orcinus orca) depredation (whales stealing or damaging fish caught on fishing gear) adversely impacts demersal longline fisheries for sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria), Pacific halibut (Hippoglossus stenolepis) and Greenland turbot (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides) in the Bering Sea, Aleutian Islands and Western Gulf of Alaska. These interactions increase direct costs and opportunity costs associated with catching fish and reduce the profitability of longline fishing in western Alaska. This study synthesizes National Marine Fisheries Service observer data, National Marine Fisheries Service sablefish longline survey and fishermen-collected depredation data to: 1) estimate the frequency of killer whale depredation on longline fisheries in Alaska; 2) estimate depredation-related catch per unit effort reductions; and 3) assess direct costs and opportunity costs incurred by longliners in western Alaska as a result of killer whale interactions. The percentage of commercial fishery sets affected by killer whales was highest in the Bering Sea fisheries for: sablefish (21.4\%), Greenland turbot (9.9\%), and Pacific halibut (6.9\%). Average catch per unit effort reductions on depredated sets ranged from 35.1–69.3\% for the observed longline fleet in all three management areas from 1998–2012 (p{\textless}0.001). To compensate for depredation, fishermen set additional gear to catch the same amount of fish, and this increased fuel costs by an additional 82\% per depredated set (average \$433 additional fuel per depredated set). In a separate analysis with six longline vessels in 2011and 2012, killer whale depredation avoidance measures resulted in an average additional cost of \$494 per depredated vessel-day for fuel and crew food. Opportunity costs of time lost by fishermen averaged \$522 per additional vessel-day on the grounds. This assessment of killer whale depredation costs represents the most extensive economic evaluation of this issue in Alaska to date and will help longline fishermen and managers consider the costs and benefits of depredation avoidance and alternative policy solutions.},

Studies have indicated the key role of host-microbiome symbiotic relationships for the coral holobiont health and development, although not all of the mechanisms of interaction have been fully explored. Here, we explore bacterial and metabolic shifts within coral holobionts under thermal stress, and its correlation with bleaching. Our results showed obvious signs of coral bleaching after 13 days of heating treatment, and a more-complex cooccurrence network was observed in the coral-associated bacterial community of the heating group. The bacterial community and metabolites changed significantly under thermal stress, and genera Flavobacterium, Shewanella and Psychrobacter increased from less than 0.1\% to 43.58\%, 6.95\% and 6.35\%, respectively. Bacteria potentially associated with stress tolerance, biofilm formation and mobile elements decreased from 80.93\%, 62.15\% and 49.27\% to 56.28\%, 28.41\% and 18.76\%, respectively. The differentially expressed metabolites of corals after heating treatment, such as Cer(d18:0/17:0), 1-Methyladenosine, Trp-P-1 and Marasmal, were associated with cell cycle regulation and antioxidant properties. Our results can contribute to our current understanding on the correlations between coral-symbiotic bacteria, metabolites and the coral physiological response to thermal stress. These new insights into the metabolomics of heat-stressed coral holobionts may expand our knowledge on the mechanisms underlying bleaching.},

	abstract = {Anthropogenic climate change threatens the persistence of coral reefs by impacting reproduction and accelerating coral loss. Adult corals depend on nutritional exchange with their endosymbiotic algae (Symbiodiniaceae) to fulfill their energetic demands. However, the mechanisms underlying the onset of this exchange during early life stages and how it contributes to developmental energy demands are unclear. We conducted an integrative analysis of the dependence on nutritional exchange across developmental stages in Montipora capitata, a vertically transmitting coral (Symbiodiniaceae are passed from parent to offspring) in Hawai□i. We applied physiological (metabolism and symbiont density) and multi-omic (metabolomics, transcriptomics, and microbial amplicon sequencing) approaches over 13 time points (1-255 hours post-fertilization; eggs, embryos, larvae, and recruits) to understand ontogenetic shifts in metabolism. Energetic demand (respiration) and symbiont population photosynthetic capacity (photosynthesis and cell density) increased with development, and metabolism shifted from using stored reserves to relying on symbiont-derived resources. Specifically, pathways associated with nutritional exchange, including organic compound transport, glucose and fatty acid metabolism, nitrogen metabolism, and reactive oxygen regulation were enriched in larvae. Recruits expanded utilization of carbohydrate and lipid pathways in response to the energetic demands of settlement and calcification. Our study shows that symbiotic nutritional exchange buffers the energetic demands of development in vertically transmitting corals, suggesting that in environmentally stressful conditions, these stages may be increasingly vulnerable to the loss of symbiont-derived nutrition. Therefore, intervening early to reduce stress during sensitive developmental stages could enhance coral reef recruitment and recovery as climate change intensifies.},

Furthermore, mechanisms of {MP} on coral and human health are also highlighted to pinpoint research gaps and potential future studies.

	title = {Multi-omic analysis of coral development elucidates the metabolic transitions from parental provisioning to endosymbiotic nutritional exchange},
	abstract = {Anthropogenic climate change threatens the persistence of coral reefs by impacting reproduction and accelerating coral loss. Adult corals depend on nutritional exchange with their endosymbiotic algae (Symbiodiniaceae) to fulfill their energetic demands. However, the mechanisms underlying the onset of this exchange during early life stages and how it contributes to developmental energy demands are unclear. We conducted an integrative analysis of the dependence on nutritional exchange across developmental stages in Montipora capitata , a vertically transmitting coral (Symbiodiniaceae are passed from parent to offspring) in Hawaiʻi. We applied physiological (metabolism and symbiont density) and multi-omic (metabolomics, transcriptomics, and microbial amplicon sequencing) approaches over 13 time points (1-255 hours post-fertilization; eggs, embryos, larvae, and settled recruits) to understand ontogenetic shifts in metabolism. Energetic demand (respiration) and symbiont population photosynthetic capacity (photosynthesis and cell density) increased with development, and metabolism shifted from using stored reserves to relying on symbiont-derived resources. Specifically, pathways associated with nutritional exchange, including organic compound transport, glucose and fatty acid metabolism, nitrogen metabolism, and reactive oxygen regulation were enriched in larvae. Recruits expanded utilization of carbohydrate and lipid pathways in response to the energetic demands of settlement and calcification. Our study shows that symbiotic nutritional exchange buffers the energetic demands of development in vertically transmitting corals, suggesting that in environmentally stressful conditions, these stages may be increasingly vulnerable to the loss of symbiont-derived nutrition. Therefore, intervening early to reduce stress during sensitive developmental stages could enhance coral reef recruitment and recovery as climate change intensifies.},

However, standard {RNAseq} methods (e.g., Illumina {TruSeq}® or {NEBNext}®) can be cost prohibitive, especially when study designs require large sample sizes. Consequently, {RNAseq} is often underused as a method, or is applied to small sample sizes that confer poor statistical power. Low cost {RNAseq} methods could therefore enable far greater and more powerful applications of transcriptomics in ecological genetics and beyond. Standard {mRNAseq} is costly partly because one sequences portions of the full length of all transcripts. Such whole-{mRNA} data are redundant for estimates of relative gene expression. {TagSeq} is an alternative method that focuses sequencing effort on {mRNAs}’ 3’ end, reducing the necessary sequencing depth per sample, and thus cost. We present a revised {TagSeq} library construction procedure, and compare its performance against {NEBNext}®, the ‘gold-standard’ whole {mRNAseq} method. We built both {TagSeq} and {NEBNext}® libraries from the same biological samples, each spiked with control {RNAs}. We found that {TagSeq} measured the control {RNA} distribution more accurately than {NEBNext}®, for a fraction of the cost per sample ( 10\%). The higher accuracy of {TagSeq} was particularly apparent for transcripts of moderate to low abundance. Technical replicates of {TagSeq} libraries are highly correlated, and were correlated with {NEBNext}® results. Overall, we show that our modified {TagSeq} protocol is an efficient alternative to traditional whole {mRNAseq}, offering researchers comparable data at greatly reduced cost.},

Global gene expression profiling is a powerful hypothesis-forming tool that can help elucidate these traits. Here, we applied a novel {RNA}-Seq protocol to study molecular responses to heat and settlement inducers in aposymbiotic larvae of the reef-building coral Acropora millepora. This analysis of a single full-sibling family revealed contrasting responses between short- (4-h) and long-term (5-day) exposures to elevated temperatures. Heat shock proteins were up-regulated only in the short-term treatment, while the long-term treatment induced the down-regulation of ribosomal proteins and up-regulation of genes associated with ion transport and metabolism (Ca2+ and {CO}32−). We also profiled responses to settlement cues using a natural cue (crustose coralline algae, {CCA}) and a synthetic neuropeptide ({GLW}-amide). Both cues resulted in metamorphosis, accompanied by differential expression of genes with known developmental roles. Some genes were regulated only by the natural cue, which may correspond to the recruitment-associated behaviour and morphology changes that precede metamorphosis under {CCA} treatment, but are bypassed under {GLW}-amide treatment. Validation of these expression profiles using {qPCR} confirmed the quantitative accuracy of our {RNA}-Seq approach. Importantly, {qPCR} analysis of different larval families revealed extensive variation in these responses depending on genetic background, including qualitative differences (i.e. up-regulation in one family and down-regulation in another). Future studies of gene expression in corals will have to address this genetic variation, which could have important adaptive consequences for corals during global climate change.},

In the rush to adopt new and improved genomic research methods, limitations of technology and experimental design may be initially neglected. Here, we review these issues with regard to {RNA} sequencing ({RNA}-seq). {RNA}-seq adds large-scale transcriptomics to the toolkit of ecological and evolutionary biologists, enabling differential gene expression ({DE}) studies in nonmodel species without the need for prior genomic resources. High biological variance is typical of field-based gene expression studies and means that larger sample sizes are often needed to achieve the same degree of statistical power as clinical studies based on data from cell lines or inbred animal models. Sequencing costs have plummeted, yet {RNA}-seq studies still underutilize biological replication. Finite research budgets force a trade-off between sequencing effort and replication in {RNA}-seq experimental design. However, clear guidelines for negotiating this trade-off, while taking into account study-specific factors affecting power, are currently lacking. Study designs that prioritize sequencing depth over replication fail to capitalize on the power of {RNA}-seq technology for {DE} inference. Significant recent research effort has gone into developing statistical frameworks and software tools for power analysis and sample size calculation in the context of {RNA}-seq {DE} analysis.

A key piece of missing information is egg and sperm gene expression. This is critical for broadcast spawning corals, such as our model, the Hawaiian species Montipora capitata, because eggs and sperm are exposed to environmental stressors during dispersal. Furthermore, parental effects such as transcriptome investment may provide a means for cross- or trans-generational plasticity and be apparent in egg and sperm transcriptome data. Methods Here, we analyzed M. capitata egg and sperm transcriptomic data to address three questions: (1) Which pathways and functions are actively transcribed in these gametes? (2) How does sperm and egg gene expression differ from adult tissues? (3) Does gene expression differ between these gametes? Results We show that egg and sperm display surprisingly similar levels of gene expression and overlapping functional enrichment patterns. These results may reflect similar environmental constraints faced by these motile gametes. We find significant differences in differential expression of egg vs. adult and sperm vs. adult {RNA}-seq data, in contrast to very few examples of differential expression when comparing egg vs. sperm transcriptomes. Lastly, using gene ontology and {KEGG} orthology data we show that both egg and sperm have markedly repressed transcription and translation machinery compared to the adult, suggesting a dependence on parental transcripts. We speculate that cell motility and calcium ion binding genes may be involved in gamete to gamete recognition in the water column and thus, fertilization.},

	abstract = {Significance
            Microbial communities associated with coral reefs influence the health and sustenance of keystone benthic organisms (e.g., coral holobionts). The present study investigated the community structure and metabolic potential of microbes inhabiting coral reefs located across an extensive area in the central Pacific. We found that the taxa present correlated strongly with the percent coverage of corals and algae, while community metabolic potential correlated best with geographic location. These findings are inconsistent with prevailing biogeographic models of microbial diversity (e.g., distance decay) and metabolic potential (i.e., similar functional profiles regardless of phylogenetic variability). Based on these findings, we propose that the primary carbon sources determine community structure and that local biogeochemistry determines finer-scale metabolic function.
          , 
            Holobionts are species-specific associations between macro- and microorganisms. On coral reefs, the benthic coverage of coral and algal holobionts varies due to natural and anthropogenic forcings. Different benthic macroorganisms are predicted to have specific microbiomes. In contrast, local environmental factors are predicted to select for specific metabolic pathways in microbes. To reconcile these two predictions, we hypothesized that adaptation of microbiomes to local conditions is facilitated by the horizontal transfer of genes responsible for specific metabolic capabilities. To test this hypothesis, microbial metagenomes were sequenced from 22 coral reefs at 11 Line Islands in the central Pacific that together span a wide range of biogeochemical and anthropogenic influences. Consistent with our hypothesis, the percent cover of major benthic functional groups significantly correlated with particular microbial taxa. Reefs with higher coral cover had a coral microbiome with higher abundances of Alphaproteobacteria (such as Rhodobacterales and Sphingomonadales), whereas microbiomes of algae-dominated reefs had higher abundances of Gammaproteobacteria (such as Alteromonadales, Pseudomonadales, and Vibrionales), Betaproteobacteria, and Bacteriodetes. In contrast to taxa, geography was the strongest predictor of microbial community metabolism. Microbial communities on reefs with higher nutrient availability (e.g., equatorial upwelling zones) were enriched in genes involved in nutrient-related metabolisms (e.g., nitrate and nitrite ammonification, Ton/Tol transport, etc.). On reefs further from the equator, microbes had more genes encoding chlorophyll biosynthesis and photosystems I/{II}. These results support the hypothesis that core microbiomes are determined by holobiont macroorganisms, and that those core taxa adapt to local conditions by selecting for advantageous metabolic genes.},

              Background
              Tropical coral reefs cover only ca. 0.1\% of the Earth’s surface but harbour exceptional marine biodiversity and provide vital ecosystem services to millions of people living nearby. They are currently threatened by global (e.g. climate change) and local (e.g. chemical pollution) stressors that interact in multiple ways. While global stressors cannot be mitigated by local actions alone, local stressors can be reduced through ecosystem management. Here, we aimed to systematically review experimental studies assessing the toxicity of chemical pollutants to tropical reef-building corals to generate accessible and usable knowledge and data that can be used to calculate measurement endpoints in ecological risk assessment. From the quantitative estimates of effects, we determined toxicity thresholds as the highest exposures tested at which no statistically significant adverse effects were observed, and we compared them to regulatory predicted no effect concentrations for the protection of marine organisms, to assess whether these reference values are indeed protective of corals.
            
            
              Methods
              The evidence was taken from a systematic map of the impacts of chemicals arising from human activity on tropical reef-building corals published in 2021. All studies in the map database corresponding to the knowledge cluster “Evidence on the ecotoxicological effects of chemicals on corals” were selected. To identify subsequently published literature, the search was updated using a subset of the search string used for the systematic map. Titles, abstracts and full-texts were screened according to the criteria defining the selected cluster of the map. Because the eligibility criteria for the systematic review are narrower than the criteria used to define the cluster in the systematic map, additional screening was performed. Studies included were critically appraised and each study was rated as low, unclear, medium, or high risk of bias. Data were extracted from the studies and synthesised according to a strategy dependent on the type of exposure and outcome.
            
            
              Review findings
              The systematic review reports the known effects of chemical exposures on corals from 847 studies corresponding to 181 articles. A total of 697 studies (161 articles) were included in the quantitative synthesis and 150 studies (50 articles) in the narrative synthesis of the findings. The quantitative synthesis records the effects of 2706 exposure concentrations-durations of 164 chemicals or mixtures of chemicals, and identifies 105 toxicity thresholds corresponding to 56 chemicals or mixtures of chemicals. When toxicity thresholds were compared to reference values set for the protection of marine organisms by environmental agencies, the reference values appear to be protective of corals for all but three chemicals assessed: the metal copper and the pesticides diuron and irgarol 1051.
            
            
              Conclusions
              This open-access database of known ecotoxicological effects of chemical exposures on corals can assist managers in the ecological risk assessment of chemicals, by allowing easy determination of various ecotoxicological thresholds. Several limitations of the toxicity tests synthesised here were noted (in particular the lack of measurement of effective concentrations for more than half of the studies). Overall, most of the currently available data on coral toxicity should be replicated independently and extended to corals from less studied geographical regions and functional groups.},

	abstract = {Background Corals, which form the foundation of biodiverse reef ecosystems, are under threat from warming oceans. Reefs provide essential ecological services, including food, income from tourism, nutrient cycling, waste removal, and the absorption of wave energy to mitigate erosion. Here, we studied the coral thermal stress response using network methods to analyze transcriptomic and polar metabolomic data generated from the Hawaiian rice coral Montipora capitata. Coral nubbins were exposed to ambient or thermal stress conditions over a 5-week period, coinciding with a mass spawning event of this species. The major goal of our study was to expand the inventory of thermal stress-related genes and metabolites present in M. capitata and to study gene-metabolite interactions. These interactions provide the foundation for functional or genetic analysis of key coral genes as well as provide potentially diagnostic markers of pre-bleaching stress. A secondary goal of our study was to analyze the accumulation of sex hormones prior to and during mass spawning to understand how thermal stress may impact reproductive success in M. capitata. Methods M. capitata was exposed to thermal stress during its spawning cycle over the course of 5 weeks, during which time transcriptomic and polar metabolomic data were collected. We analyzed these data streams individually, and then integrated both data sets using {MAGI} (Metabolite Annotation and Gene Integration) to investigate molecular transitions and biochemical reactions. Results Our results reveal the complexity of the thermal stress phenome in M. capitata, which includes many genes involved in redox regulation, biomineralization, and reproduction. The size and number of modules in the gene co-expression networks expanded from the initial stress response to the onset of bleaching. The later stages involved the suppression of metabolite transport by the coral host, including a variety of sodium-coupled transporters and a putative ammonium transporter, possibly as a response to reduction in algal productivity. The gene-metabolite integration data suggest that thermal treatment results in the activation of animal redox stress pathways involved in quenching molecular oxygen to prevent an overabundance of reactive oxygen species. Lastly, evidence that thermal stress affects reproductive activity was provided by the downregulation of {CYP}-like genes and the irregular production of sex hormones during the mass spawning cycle. Overall, redox regulation and metabolite transport are key components of the coral animal thermal stress phenome. Mass spawning was highly attenuated under thermal stress, suggesting that global climate change may negatively impact reproductive behavior in this species.},

However, most knowledge of the coral microbiome has come from reef-building scleractinian corals, with far less known about the nature and importance of the microbiome of octocorals (subclass Octocorallia), which contribute significantly to reef biodiversity and functional complexity. We examined the diversity and structure of the bacterial component of octocoral microbiomes over summer and winter, with a focus on two temperate (Erythropodium hicksoni, Capnella gaboensis; Sydney Harbour) and two tropical (Sinularia sp., Sarcophyton sp.; Heron Island) species common to reefs in eastern Australia. Bacterial communities associated with these octocorals were also compared to common temperate (Plesiastrea versipora) and tropical (Acropora aspera) hard corals from the same reefs. Using 16S {rRNA} amplicon sequencing, bacterial diversity was found to be heterogeneous among octocorals, but we observed changes in composition between summer and winter for some species (C. gaboensis and Sinularia sp.), but not for others (E. hicksoni and Sarcophyton sp.). Bacterial community structure differed significantly between all octocoral species within both the temperate and tropical environments. However, on a seasonal basis, those differences were less pronounced. The microbiomes of C. gaboensis and Sinularia sp. were dominated by bacteria belonging to the genus Endozoicomonas, which were a key conserved feature of their core microbiomes. In contrast to previous studies, our analysis revealed that Endozoicomonas phylotypes are shared across different octocoral species, inhabiting different environments. Together, our data demonstrates that octocorals harbour a broad diversity of bacterial partners, some of which comprise ‘core microbiomes’ that potentially impart important functional roles to their hosts.},

Moreover, the paper provides novel data on the biological effects of some of these plasticizers in invertebrates, fish and amphibians. Phthalates and {BPA} have been shown to affect reproduction in all studied animal groups, to impair development in crustaceans and amphibians and to induce genetic aberrations. Molluscs, crustaceans and amphibians appear to be especially sensitive to these compounds, and biological effects are observed at environmentally relevant exposures in the low ng l−1 to µg l−1 range. In contrast, most effects in fish (except for disturbance in spermatogenesis) occur at higher concentrations. Most plasticizers appear to act by interfering with the functioning of various hormone systems, but some phthalates have wider pathways of disruption. Effect concentrations of plasticizers in laboratory experiments coincide with measured environmental concentrations, and thus there is a very real potential for effects of these chemicals on some wildlife populations. The most striking gaps in our current knowledge on the impacts of plasticizers on wildlife are the lack of data for long-term exposures to environmentally relevant concentrations and their ecotoxicity when part of complex mixtures. Furthermore, the hazard of plasticizers has been investigated in annelids, molluscs and arthropods only, and given the sensitivity of some invertebrates, effects assessments are warranted in other invertebrate phyla.},

	abstract = {Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ({PAHs}) are highly toxic environmental pollutants and are threatening scler­ actinian corals. In this study, {PAHs} treatment did not induce significant physiological responses of the coral Pocillopora damicornis and its algal symbionts, but biological processes including response to toxin, drug meta­ bolic, and oxidation reduction were triggered at the {mRNA} level. These results implied that {PAHs} could be a group of slow-acting environmental toxicants, whose effects were moderate but persistent. Besides, it was interesting to find that {PAHs} activated the neuroendocrine system in the coral by triggering the expression of monoaminergic and acetylcholinergic system related genes, indicating that {PAHs} might function as environ­ mental hormones. Moreover, the combined treatments of {PAHs} and heat caused a much obvious effect on the coral and its algal symbionts by elevating antioxidant activity and suppressing photosynthesis in the symbionts. Results from the transcriptome data further indicated that corals might perform stress responses upon {PAHs} and heat challenges through the {TNF} and apoptosis pathways, which perhaps was modulated by the neuroendocrine system of corals. Collectively, our survey demonstrates that the {PAHs} can function as environmental hormones and activate the neuroendocrine regulation in scleractinian corals, which may contribute to the stress responses of symbiotic association by modulating photosynthesis, antioxidation, and apoptosis.},

	abstract = {Competitive superiority among encrusting species is established when the margin of one species consistently overgrows another. By measuring overgrowth patterns for the two most abundant tidepool species of crustose coralline algae (Lithophyllum impressum and Pseudolithophyllum whidbeyense) in the San Juan Islands of Washington State, we documented a reversal in competitive dominance that occurs at about the +1 m level; L. impressum wins in upper zones and P. whidbeyense in lower zones. Regardless of tidepool elevation or species, thicker crusts overgrow thinner ones and crusts of equal thickness are competitively equal. Both crust species are grazed by limpets (primarily Lottia pelta and Tectura scutum), which are the dominant herbivores in tidepools. Laboratory experiments show that limpet grazing can reduce crust thickness. Laboratory and field analyses of limpet grazing indicate that corallines in tidepools in the upper intertidal zone are subject to high frequency (bite rate per unit area) and low intensity (penetration depth per bite) limpet grazing, whereas those in low tidepools are subjected to opposite grazing characteristics. L. impressum is a thick crust, which has a multicellular covering over its meristem. This covering protects the growing portion of the plant from the frequent, low—intensity herbivory that occurs in the higher tidepools. In contrast, P. whidbeyense lacks a multilayered epithallus and is more susceptible to injury in high tidepools. In low pools, meristems of both crusts are injured. L. impressum heals these deep wounds by regenerating vertically, but the net result is a thinner plant that is easily overgrown. P. whidbeyense dominates the low zone because it is capable of much more rapid lateral growth including over its own deep wounds; the crust overgrows itself, thereby developing a thicker thallus and improving its competitive success over L. impressum. We suggest that a continuum of defensive and regenerative characteristics exists among organisms; the adaptive nature of these depends on the levels of production and the frequency and intensity of disturbance in their environment. It is evident that herbivory is important in this system, not by the traditional mechanism of releasing limiting resources (e.g., primary space), but by mediating competitive abilities through the relative susceptibility to, and recovery from, herbivory—induced disturbance.},

Its distribution in Kaneohe Bay during May 1976was nearly the same as when it was originally planted 2 yr earlier. It lacked the ability to disperse over shallow depressions both in the reef and in deep water , and it did not colonize neighboring reefs without the help of man. Depth was the single most important physical factor limiting its dispersal. A total fresh weight standing crop of from 21 to 24 metric ton s of E. striatum was recorded on a 500-m-long section of reef edge from December 1976 to June 1977. When protected from grazing its growth rate was about 5.0 percent/day. Data support the conclusion that the population on the reef edge was maintained only by a steady influx of thallus fragments that escaped from enclosed experimental plantings on the reef flat. When the experimental plantings were removed the population could not maintain itself and soon disappeared. Eucheuma striatum did not compete with native algal macrophytes and appeared to be the basis of a community richer in animal species than adjacent reefs. It provided 10-20 tons/me of food for grazing fish, shelter , and a substratum for numerous invertebrates. Eucheuma striatum did not attach to corals, but it did cause their death by shading.},

	abstract = {A high resolution coastal and ocean hydrodynamic model system was used to investigate the transport and deposition patterns of Particulate Organic Matter ({POM}) from kelp farmed at three locations of different properties: a sheltered location, an exposed location, and an offshore location. Published values on the sinking speeds of organic particles from kelp were used, spanning several orders of magnitude. Recent work on quantifying the release of particulate organic matter from farmed kelp was used to link the release of carbon to possible cultivation volumes and scenarios, and finally to link this to the potential for carbon loading on the ocean floor. The results are presented in terms of loading and distribution per unit harvested kelp, and the loading estimates are compared with estimates of natural (background) primary production. According to the simulation results, organic matter may be transported anything from a few (hundred) meters up to a hundred km away from the release site, depending on the sinking rates, time of release, and the location. The depth at which the matter settles on the sea floor likewise depends on the properties of the matter and the sites. The time until settlement varied from minutes to several hundred hours. The results underscore the importance of constraining the dispersal and deposition of detritus from kelp cultivation in order to better understand and quantify associated environmental risks posed by organic loading, and the potential for seafloor carbon sequestration by kelp farming as a nature based climate solution.},

	abstract = {Organelles are intracellular compartments which are themselves compartmentalized. Biogenic and metabolic processes are localized to specialized domains or microcompartments to enhance their efficiency and suppress deleterious side reactions. An example of intra-organellar compartmentalization is the pyrenoid in the chloroplasts of algae and hornworts. This microcompartment enhances the photosynthetic {CO}2-fixing activity of the Calvin-Benson cycle enzyme Rubisco, suppresses an energetically wasteful oxygenase activity of Rubisco, and mitigates limiting {CO}2 availability in aquatic environments. Hence, the pyrenoid is functionally analogous to the carboxysomes in cyanobacteria. However, a comprehensive analysis of pyrenoid functions based on its protein composition is lacking. Here we report a proteomic characterization of the pyrenoid in the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Pyrenoid-enriched fractions were analyzed by quantitative mass spectrometry. Contaminant proteins were identified by parallel analyses of pyrenoid-deficient mutants. This pyrenoid proteome contains 190 proteins, many of which function in processes that are known or proposed to occur in pyrenoids: e.g. the carbon concentrating mechanism, starch metabolism or {RNA} metabolism and translation. Using radioisotope pulse labeling experiments, we show that pyrenoid-associated ribosomes could be engaged in the localized synthesis of the large subunit of Rubisco. New pyrenoid functions are supported by proteins in tetrapyrrole and chlorophyll synthesis, carotenoid metabolism or amino acid metabolism. Hence, our results support the long-standing hypothesis that the pyrenoid is a hub for metabolism. The 81 proteins of unknown function reveal candidates for new participants in these processes. Our results provide biochemical evidence of pyrenoid functions and a resource for future research on pyrenoids and their use to enhance agricultural plant productivity.

	abstract = {Thermal tolerance is often interpreted as a species-wide thermal niche in the absence of studies focusing on the adaptive potential of populations to exhibit differential thermal tolerance. Thus, considering intraspecific thermal plasticity, local adaptation or both between populations along distributional gradients when interpreting and predicting species responses to warming is imperative. Removing the effect of environmental histories by raising kelp gametophyte generations
              in vitro
              under common garden conditions allows unbiased comparison between population-specific adaptive variation under different environmental conditions. Following this approach, this study aims to detect (potentially) adaptive differentiation in microscopic life-stages (gametophytes) between populations of a temperate forest forming kelp,
              Laminaria ochroleuca
              from locations with distinct thermal conditions. Gametophytes from four geographically distinct populations were subjected to different temperature treatments (17, marine heat waves of 23, 25 and 27°C) and gametophyte survival during thermal stress as well as reproductive success and photosynthetic responses during recovery were investigated. Intraspecific variation in resilience and reproductive output to thermal stress was found in
              L. ochroleuca
              ; gametophytes from the most northern population (Brittany, France) were the most thermally sensitive, with mortality onset at 23°C, whereas mortality in the remaining populations was only apparent at 27°C. Gametophytes from northern Spain and Morocco exhibited very low reproductive success during recovery from 23 and 25°C. However, when recovering from the highest thermal treatment (27°C) the reproductive development and sporophyte output was higher than in the gametophytes from France and Italy (Mediterranean). The population-specific responses of gametophyte resilience and reproductive success to temperature stress suggest genetic differentiation in response to variation in local thermal regimes.},

	abstract = {Kelp forests are economically important ecosystems that support a wealth of biodiversity but are declining globally. They are often replaced by biologically depauperate alternate stable states dominated by turfing algae. Hysteresis maintains algal turfs by inhibiting kelp recruitment, preventing the reestablishment of kelp forests. The mechanisms inhibiting kelp recruitment remain poorly understood as microscopic stages of kelp are difficult to study in situ. A potential mechanism contributing to the suppression of recruitment may be turf-facilitated grazing of kelp gametophytes, the haploid free-living reproductive life stage. Here we assess the resilience of kelp gametophytes to grazing pressure from a gastropod micrograzer commonly present in turf under current and future ocean warming scenarios. Gametophyte coverage and abundance were significantly reduced following grazing under all temperatures, however there was no significant effect of temperature on grazing rates. Once grazing pressure was removed, gametophyte abundance recovered to control levels, but the total coverage and length of gametophytes continued to decline in all treatments. Gametophytes were found to survive micrograzer ingestion and continued to grow in aggregations in the gastropod’s mucus trail and faeces, even producing sporophytes. Gametophyte survival post-ingestion may positively contribute to dispersal and sporophyte recruitment, however the lack of gametophyte recovery at elevated temperatures may counteract this effect under future ocean warming. Taken together, this study demonstrates complex interactions that take place in the turf micro-habitat of kelp gametophytes and highlights biotic factors influencing transitions between kelp forests and algal turfs.},

	abstract = {Saccharina latissima is an economically and ecologically relevant kelp species in Europe and North America. In kelps, the sexuality is expressed during the haploid life stage and the microscopic gametophytes exhibit significant sexual dimorphism. To understand the sex-dependent impact of temperature on the gametophyte stage, we analyzed for the first time, gene expression profiles of male and female gametophytes at three different temperatures (4, 12, and 20°C) characteristic for the species distribution range by using {RNA}-sequencing. We identified several differentially expressed genes ({DEGs}) between sexes; while female biased genes were enriched in general metabolism and energy production, male biased genes function within cell cycle and signaling. In our study, temperature modulated sex-biased gene expression, with only a small percentage of {DEGs} consistently male (7\%) or female-biased (12\%) at the three temperatures. Female gametophytes responded stronger to higher temperatures than males, suggesting that males are more heat tolerant. Differences between S. latissima and other brown algal gender-dependent gene expression might mirror the different evolutionary and ecological contexts. Genomic information on kelp gametophyte is still scarce and thus this study adds to our knowledge on sex differences in abiotic stress responses in macroalgae at the transcriptomic level.},

	abstract = {All animals are host to a multitude of microorganisms that are essential to the animal’s health. Host-associated microbes have been shown to defend against potential pathogens, provide essential nutrients, interact with the host’s immune system, and even regulate mood. However, it can be difficult to preserve and obtain nucleic acids from some host-associated microbiomes, making studying their microbial communities challenging. Corals are an example of this, in part due to their potentially remote, underwater locations, their thick surface mucopolysaccharide layer, and various inherent molecular inhibitors. This study examined three different preservatives ({RNAlater}, {DNA}/{RNA} Shield, and liquid nitrogen) and two extraction methods (the Qiagen {PowerBiofilm} kit and the Promega Maxwell {RBC} kit with modifications) to determine if there was an optimum combination for examining the coral microbiome. These methods were employed across taxonomically diverse coral species, including deep-sea/shallow, stony/soft, and zooxanthellate/azooxanthellate: Lophelia pertusa, Paragorgia johnsoni, Montastraea cavernosa, Porites astreoides, and Stephanocoenia intersepta. Although significant differences were found between preservative types and extraction methods, these differences were subtle, and varied in nature from coral species to coral species. Significant differences between coral species were far more profound than those detected between preservative or extraction method. We suggest that the preservative types presented here and extraction methods using a bead-beating step provide enough consistency to compare coral microbiomes across various studies, as long as subtle differences in microbial communities are attributed to dissimilar methodologies. Additionally, the inclusion of internal controls such as a mock community and extraction blanks can help provide context regarding data quality, improving downstream analyses.},

We demonstrate excellent consistency in taxonomic recovery and recapture diversity patterns that were previously reported on the basis of metaanalysis of many studies from the literature (notably, the saline/nonsaline split in environmental samples and the split between host-associated and free-living communities). We also demonstrate that 2,000 Illumina single-end reads are sufficient to recapture the same relationships among samples that we observe with the full dataset. The results thus open up the possibility of conducting large-scale studies analyzing thousands of samples simultaneously to survey microbial communities at an unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution.},

	abstract = {{RNAseq} is a relatively new tool for ecological genetics that offers researchers insight into changes in gene expression in response to a myriad of natural or experimental conditions. However, standard {RNAseq} methods (e.g., Illumina {TruSeq}® or {NEBNext}®) can be cost prohibitive, especially when study designs require large sample sizes. Consequently, {RNAseq} is often underused as a method, or is applied to small sample sizes that confer poor statistical power. Low cost {RNAseq} methods could therefore enable far greater and more powerful applications of transcriptomics in ecological genetics and beyond. Standard {mRNAseq} is costly partly because one sequences portions of the full length of all transcripts. Such whole-{mRNA} data are redundant for estimates of relative gene expression. {TagSeq} is an alternative method that focuses sequencing effort on {mRNAs}’ 3’ end, reducing the necessary sequencing depth per sample, and thus cost. We present a revised {TagSeq} library construction procedure, and compare its performance against {NEBNext}®, the ‘gold-standard’ whole {mRNAseq} method. We built both {TagSeq} and {NEBNext}® libraries from the same biological samples, each spiked with control {RNAs}. We found that {TagSeq} measured the control {RNA} distribution more accurately than {NEBNext}®, for a fraction of the cost per sample ( 10\%). The higher accuracy of {TagSeq} was particularly apparent for transcripts of moderate to low abundance. Technical replicates of {TagSeq} libraries are highly correlated, and were correlated with {NEBNext}® results. Overall, we show that our modified {TagSeq} protocol is an efficient alternative to traditional whole {mRNAseq}, offering researchers comparable data at greatly reduced cost.},

In addition, the diverse microbes that associate with corals have the capacity for more rapid change, potentially aiding the adaptation of long-lived corals. Here, we show that the microbiome of reef corals is different across thermally variable habitats and changes over time when corals are reciprocally transplanted. Exposing these corals to thermal bleaching conditions changes the microbiome for heat-sensitive corals, but not for heat-tolerant corals growing in habitats with natural high heat extremes. Importantly, particular bacterial taxa predict the coral host response in a short-term heat stress experiment. Such associations could result from parallel responses of the coral and the microbial community to living at high natural temperatures. A competing hypothesis is that the microbial community and coral heat tolerance are causally linked.},

We explore here functional traits underpinning the complex biology of Symbiodinium that spans free-living algae to coral endosymbionts. In doing so we propose a mechanistic framework integrating the primary traits of resource acquisition and utilisation as a means to explain Symbiodinium functional diversity and to resolve the role of Symbiodinium in driving the stability of coral reefs under an uncertain future.},

	abstract = {As the field of conservation physiology develops and becomes increasingly integrated with ecology and conservation science, the fundamental concept of scale is being recognized as important, particularly for ensuring that physiological knowledge is contextualized in a manner most relevant to policy makers, conservation practitioners and stakeholders. Failure to consider the importance of scale in conservation physiology—both the challenges and the opportunities that it creates—will impede the ability of this discipline to generate the scientific understanding needed to contribute to meaningful conservation outcomes. Here, we have focused on five aspects of scale: biological, spatial, temporal, allometric and phylogenetic. We also considered the scale of policy and policy application relevant to those five types of scale as well as the merits of upscaling and downscaling to explore and address conservation problems. Although relevant to all systems (e.g. freshwater, terrestrial) we have used examples from the marine realm, with a particular emphasis on fishes, given the fact that there is existing discourse regarding scale and its relevance for marine conservation and management. Our synthesis revealed that all five aspects of scale are relevant to conservation physiology, with many aspects inherently linked. It is apparent that there are both opportunities and challenges afforded by working across scales but, to understand mechanisms underlying conservation problems, it is essential to consider scale of all sorts and to work across scales to the greatest extent possible. Moreover, given that the scales in biological processes will often not match policy and management scales, conservation physiology needs to show how it is relevant to aspects at different policy/management scales, change the scales at which policy/management intervention is applied or be prepared to be ignored.},

Here we review applications of dynamic energy budget ({DEB}) theory to conservation issues and discuss how this theory for metabolic organization of all life on earth (from bacteria to whales) is well equipped to support current and future investigations in conservation research. {DEB} theory was first invented in 1979 in an applied institution for environmental quality assessment and mitigation. The theory has since undergone extensive development and applications. An increasing number of studies using {DEB} modelling have provided valuable insights and predictions in areas that pertain to conservation such as species distribution, evolutionary biology, toxicological impacts and ecosystem management. We discuss why {DEB} theory, through its mechanistic nature, its universality and the wide range of outcomes it can provide represents a valuable tool to tackle some of the current and future challenges linked to maintaining biodiversity, ensuring species survival, ecotoxicology, setting water and soil quality standards and restoring ecosystem structure and functioning in a changing environment under the pressure of anthropogenic driven changes.},

Overall, we illustrate how a conservation physiology approach can provide sensitive biomarkers of environmental change, reveal the underlying mechanisms of conservation issues, and allow for proactive conservation strategies. In turn, conservation physiology can tackle diverse conservation issues ranging from monitoring environmental stress, predicting the impact of climate change, understanding disease dynamics, improving captive breeding, reducing human–wildlife conflict, and many others. The diversity of taxa, biological scales, and ecosystems that are highlighted illustrate the far-reaching nature of the discipline and allow readers to gain an appreciation of the purpose, value, and status of the field.},

	abstract = {The field of conservation physiology strives to achieve conservation goals by revealing physiological mechanisms that drive population declines in the face of human-induced rapid environmental change ({HIREC}) and has informed many successful conservation actions. However, many studies still struggle to explicitly link individual physiological measures to impacts across the biological hierarchy (to population and ecosystem levels) and instead rely on a ‘black box’ of assumptions to scale up results for conservation implications. Here, we highlight some examples of studies that were successful in scaling beyond the individual level, including two case studies of well-researched species, and using other studies we highlight challenges and future opportunities to increase the impact of research by scaling up the biological hierarchy. We first examine studies that use individual physiological measures to scale up to population-level impacts and discuss several emerging fields that have made significant steps toward addressing the gap between individual-based and demographic studies, such as macrophysiology and landscape physiology. Next, we examine how future studies can scale from population or species-level to communityand ecosystem-level impacts and discuss avenues of research that can lead to conservation implications at the ecosystem level, such as abiotic gradients and interspecific interactions. In the process, we review methods that researchers can use to make links across the biological hierarchy, including crossing disciplinary boundaries, collaboration and data sharing, spatial modelling and incorporating multiple markers (e.g. physiological, behavioural or demographic) into their research. We recommend future studies incorporating tools that consider the diversity of ‘landscapes’ experienced by animals at higher levels of the biological hierarchy, will make more effective contributions to conservation and management decisions.},

	abstract = {The plasticity of some coral-associated microbial communities under stressors like warming and ocean acidification suggests the microbiome has a role in the acclimatization of corals to future ocean conditions. Here, we evaluated the acclimatization potential of coral-associated microbial communities of four Hawaiian coral species ( Porites compressa , Porites lobata , Montipora capitata , and Pocillopora acuta ) over 22-month mesocosm experiment. The corals were exposed to one of four treatments: control, ocean acidification, ocean warming, or combined future ocean conditions. Over the 22-month study, 33–67\% of corals died or experienced a loss of most live tissue coverage in the ocean warming and future ocean treatments while only 0–10\% died in the ocean acidification and control. Among the survivors, coral-associated microbial communities responded to the chronic future ocean treatment in one of two ways: (1) microbial communities differed between the control and future ocean treatment, suggesting the potential capacity for acclimatization, or (2) microbial communities did not significantly differ between the control and future ocean treatment. The first strategy was observed in both Porites species and was associated with higher survivorship compared to M . capitata and P . acuta which exhibited the second strategy. Interestingly, the microbial community responses to chronic stressors were independent of coral physiology. These findings indicate acclimatization of microbial communities may confer resilience in some species of corals to chronic warming associated with climate change. However, M . capitata genets that survived the future ocean treatment hosted significantly different microbial communities from those that died, suggesting the microbial communities of the survivors conferred some resilience. Thus, even among coral species with inflexible microbial communities, some individuals may already be tolerant to future ocean conditions. These findings suggest that coral-associated microbial communities could play an important role in the persistence of some corals and underlie climate change-driven shifts in coral community composition.},

	title = {Contrasting effects of Symbiodinium identity on coral host transcriptional profiles across latitudes},
	abstract = {Reef‐building corals can increase their resistance to heat‐induced bleaching through adaptation and acclimatization and/or by associating with a more thermo‐tolerant strain of algal symbiont (Symbiodinium sp.). Here, we show that these two adaptive pathways interact. We collected Acropora millepora corals from two contrasting thermal environments on the Great Barrier Reef: cooler, mid‐latitude Orpheus Island, where all corals hosted a heat‐sensitive clade C Symbiodinium, and warmer, low‐latitude Wilkie Island, where corals hosted either a clade C or a more thermo‐tolerant clade D. Corals were kept in a benign common garden to reveal differences in baseline gene expression, reflecting prior adaptation/long‐term acclimatization. Modelbased analysis identified gene expression differences between Wilkie and Orpheus corals that were negatively correlated with previously described transcriptome‐wide signatures of heat stress, signifying generally elevated thermotolerance of Wilkie corals. Yet, model‐free analyses of gene expression revealed that Wilkie corals hosting clade C were distinct from Wilkie corals hosting clade D, whereas Orpheus corals were more variable. Wilkie corals hosting clade C symbionts exhibited unique functional signatures, including downregulation of histone proteins and ion channels and upregulation of chaperones and {RNA} processing genes, putatively representing constitutive “frontloading” of stress response genes. Furthermore, clade C Symbiodinium exhibited constitutive expression differences between Wilkie and Orpheus, indicative of contrasting life history strategies. Our results demonstrate that hosting alternative Symbiodinium types is associated with different pathways of local adaptation for the coral host. These interactions could play a significant role in setting the direction of genetic adaptation to global warming in the two symbiotic partners.},

	abstract = {Microplastic pollution is a major threat to the marine environment attracting attention from scientific and public communities. Although we have sufficient evidence that microplastic is ubiquitous in all ecosystems, the ques­ tion of the harmfulness of microplastic exposure is still under debate. Filter feeders like bivalves are commonly exposed to microplastics in water and sediments and thus can serve as excellent biological indicators for microplastic pollution. A relatively rich toxicological literature has been focusing on microplastic effects on bivalves but we have yet to reach an agreement on the toxic effects and mechanisms of microplastics. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis and bibliometrics analysis of the microplastic studies in bivalves. The bibliometric analysis (used to evaluate the general research trends) showed that the investigation of microplastic distribution in the marine environment and the molecular mechanisms of microplastic toxicity are the two major hot spots of research. Based on analyses of ecologically and environmentally relevant microplastics concentrations, particle sizes and polymer types, we discuss the physiological effects of microplastics on bivalves, and the severity and direction of the effects at the cellular, tissue, organ and organismal levels. The meta-analysis results show that microplastics can induce time-dependent oxidative stress in bivalves. Generally, the activities of antioxidant enzymes, such as glutathione peroxidase ({GPx}), glutathione-S-transferase ({GST}) and superoxide dismutase ({SOD}) increased during short-term exposure but declined after long-term exposure to microplastics. Non-linear response of {GPx}, {GST} and {SOD} enzymes to {MP} exposure over time indicate that these enzymes are not good biomarkers of {MPs} effects in marine bivalves. The tissue glutathione levels and catalase ({CAT} activity) showed an increase during both short- and long term {MP} exposures and thus can be used as oxidative stress biomarkers of sublethal {MPs} effects in marine bivalves.},

The process through which such organisms prepare their phenotype for an improved response to future stress has been termed ‘priming’. However, other terms are also used for this phenomenon, especially when considering priming in different types of organisms and when referring to different stressors. Here we propose a conceptual framework for priming of stress responses in bacteria, fungi and plants which allows comparison of priming with other terms, e.g. adaptation, acclimation, induction, acquired resistance and cross protection. We address spatial and temporal aspects of priming and highlight current knowledge about the mechanisms necessary for information storage which range from epigenetic marks to the accumulation of (dormant) signalling molecules. Furthermore, we outline possible patterns of primed stress responses. Finally, we link the ability of organisms to become primed for stress responses (their ‘primability’) with evolutionary ecology aspects and discuss which properties of an organism and its environment may favour the evolution of priming of stress responses.},

Using random quadrat surveys, we quantitatively documented the coral community structure one year before and one year after the bleaching event. The 1998 bleaching event reduced coral species richness by 61\% and reduced coral cover by 85\%. Colony morphology affected bleaching vulnerability and subsequent coral mortality. Finely branched corals were most susceptible, while massive and encrusting colonies survived. Most heavily impacted were the branched Acropora and pocilloporid corals, some of which showed local extinction. We suggest two hypotheses whose synergistic effect may partially explain observed mortality patterns (i.e. preferential survival of thick-tissued species, and shape-dependent differences in colony mass-transfer efficiency). A community-structural shift occurred on Okinawan reefs, resulting in an increase in the relative abundance of massive and encrusting coral species.},

This integrated multi-{OMIC} study also revealed the different mechanisms used for ester side-chain removal from the different plasticizers (esterases and enzymes involved in the β-oxidation pathway) as well as the molecular response to deal with toxic intermediates, that is, phthalate, and the lower biodegrading potential detected for {ATBC} than for {PAE} plasticizers. This study highlights the metabolic potential that exists in the biofilms that colonize plastics—the Plastisphere—to effectively biodegrade plastic additives and flags the inherent importance of microbes in reducing plastic toxicity in the environment.},

Here, we compare the performance of 14 differential abundance testing methods on 38 16S {rRNA} gene datasets with two sample groups. We test for differences in amplicon sequence variants and operational taxonomic units ({ASVs}) between these groups. Our findings confirm that these tools identified drastically different numbers and sets of significant {ASVs}, and that results depend on data pre-processing. For many tools the number of features identified correlate with aspects of the data, such as sample size, sequencing depth, and effect size of community differences. {ALDEx}2 and {ANCOM}-{II} produce the most consistent results across studies and agree best with the intersect of results from different approaches.

However, there remain a number of challenges that might retard the adoption of this approach. Here, we identify these challenges and suggest a path for both physiologists and conservation practitioners to integrate their respective ﬁelds. One issue is that threat assessments and conservation actions tend to focus on populations or species, whereas physiology tends to focus on individuals, cells, or molecules. Physiologists must determine if and how the physiology of individual organisms can inﬂuence population-level processes. It is also necessary to validate more tools in the “conservation physiology toolbox,” and ensure a thorough understanding of the physiological biomarkers applied to conservation efforts. Research on imperiled taxa will be more useful to those making management decisions, rather than research focused on model species. We also recommend changes in the education of physiologists such that physiologists understand the process of policy making, and the needs of conservation practitioners.},

While a multi-disciplinary toolbox can only help to address the global biodiversity crisis, any field can face challenges while becoming established, particularly highly applied disciplines that require multi-stakeholder involvement. Gaining first-hand knowledge of the challenges that conservation physiologists are facing can help characterize the current state of the field and build a better foundation for determining how it can grow. Through an online survey of 468 scientists working at the intersection of physiology and conservation, we aimed to identify characteristics of those engaging in conservation physiology research (e.g. demographics, primary taxa of study), gauge conservation physiology’s role in contributing to on-the-ground conservation action, identify the perceived barriers to achieving success and determine how difficult any identified barriers are to overcome. Despite all participants having experience combining physiology and conservation, only one-third considered themselves to be ‘conservation physiologists’. Moreover, there was a general perception that conservation physiology does not yet regularly lead to tangible conservation success. Respondents identified the recent conceptualization of the field and the broader issue of adequately translating science into management action as the primary reasons for these deficits. Other significant barriers that respondents have faced when integrating physiology and conservation science included a lack of funding, logistical constraints (e.g. sample sizes, obtaining permits) and a lack of physiological baseline data (i.e. reference ranges of a physiological metric’s ‘normal’ or pre-environmental change levels). We identified 12 actions based on suggestions of survey participants that we anticipate will help deconstruct the barriers and continue to develop a narrative of physiology that is relevant to conservation science, policy and practice.},

We propose a framework that demonstrates an integrative approach between physiology, conservation and policy, where each can inform the design, conduct and implementation of the other. Each junction of the conservation physiology process has the capacity to foster dialogue that contributes to effective implementation, monitoring, assessment and evaluation. This approach enables effective evaluation and implementation of evidence-based conservation policy and management decisions through a process of ongoing refinement, but may require that scientists (from the disciplines of both physiology and conservation) and policy-makers bridge interdisciplinary knowledge gaps.

	abstract = {All animals studied to date are associated with symbiotic communities of microorganisms. These animal microbiotas often play important roles in normal physiological function and susceptibility to disease; predicting their responses to perturbation represents an essential challenge for microbiology. Most studies of microbiome dynamics test for patterns in which perturbation shifts animal microbiomes from a healthy to a dysbiotic stable state. Here, we consider a complementary alternative: that the microbiological changes induced by many perturbations are stochastic, and therefore lead to transitions from stable to unstable community states. The result is an ‘Anna Karenina principle’ for animal microbiomes, in which dysbiotic individuals vary more in microbial community composition than healthy individuals—paralleling Leo Tolstoy's dictum that “all happy families look alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way”. We argue that Anna Karenina effects are a common and important response of animal microbiomes to stressors that reduce the ability of the host or its microbiome to regulate community composition. Patterns consistent with Anna Karenina effects have been found in systems ranging from the surface of threatened corals exposed to above-average temperatures, to the lungs of patients suffering from {HIV}/{AIDs}. However, despite their apparent ubiquity, these patterns are easily missed or discarded by some common workflows, and therefore probably underreported. Now that a substantial body of research has established the existence of these patterns in diverse systems, rigorous testing, intensive time-series datasets and improved stochastic modelling will help to explore their importance for topics ranging from personalized medicine to theories of the evolution of host–microorganism symbioses.},

	abstract = {Investigations of host-symbiont interactions can benefit enormously from a complete and reliable holobiont gene expression profiling. The most efficient way to acquire holobiont transcriptomes is to perform {RNA}-Seq on both host and symbionts simultaneously. However, optimal methods for capturing both host and symbiont {mRNAs} are still under development, particularly when the host is a eukaryote and the symbionts are bacteria or archaea. Traditionally, poly(A)-enriched libraries have been used to capture eukaryotic {mRNA}, but the ability of this method to adequately capture bacterial {mRNAs} is unclear because of the short half-life of the bacterial transcripts. Here, we address this gap in knowledge with the aim of helping others to choose an appropriate {RNA}-Seq approach for analysis of animal host-bacterial symbiont transcriptomes. Specifically, we compared transcriptome bias, depth and coverage achieved by two different {mRNA} capture and sequencing strategies applied to the marine demosponge Amphimedon queenslandica holobiont. Annotated genomes of the sponge host and the three most abundant bacterial symbionts, which can comprise up to 95\% of the adult microbiome, are available. Importantly, this allows for transcriptomes to be accurately mapped to these genomes, and thus quantitatively assessed and compared. The two strategies that we compare here are (i) poly(A) captured {mRNA}-Seq (Poly(A)-{RNA}-Seq) and (ii) ribosomal {RNA} depleted {RNA}-Seq ({rRNA}-depleted-{RNA}-Seq). For the host sponge, we find no significant difference in transcriptomes generated by the two different {mRNA} capture methods. However, for the symbiont transcriptomes, we confirm the expectation that the {rRNA}-depleted-{RNA}-Seq performs much better than the Poly(A)-{RNA}-Seq. This comparison demonstrates that {RNA}-Seq by ribosomal {RNA} depletion is an effective and reliable method to simultaneously capture gene expression in host and symbionts and thus to analyse holobiont transcriptomes.},

The gut microbiome remodels host chromatin, causes differential splicing, alters the epigenetic landscape, and directly interrupts host signaling cascades. Emerging techniques like single-cell {RNA} sequencing and organoid generation have the potential to refine our understanding of the relationship between the gut microbiome and host gene expression in the future.

This ‘microbiome’ possesses the requisite functional diversity to conduct a range of nitrogen (N) transformations including denitrification, nitrification, nitrogen fixation and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium ({DNRA}). Very little direct evidence has been presented to date verifying that these processes are active within tropical corals. Here we use a combination of stable isotope techniques, nutrient uptake calculations and captured metagenomics to quantify rates of nitrogen cycling processes in a selection of tropical scleractinian corals. Denitrification activity was detected in all species, albeit with very low rates, signifying limited importance in holobiont N removal. Relatively greater nitrogen fixation activity confirms that corals are net N importers to reef systems. Low net nitrification activity suggests limited N regeneration capacity; however substantial gross nitrification activity may be concealed through nitrate consumption. Based on {nrfA} gene abundance and measured inorganic N fluxes, we calculated significant {DNRA} activity in the studied corals, which has important implications for coral reef N cycling and warrants more targeted investigation. Through the quantification and characterisation of all relevant N-cycling processes, this study provides clarity on the subject of tropical coral-associated biogeochemical N-cycling.},

Moreover, no such study has utilized {RNA} derived from bacterial biofilms, which have potentially higher {rRNA}:{mRNA} ratios and higher {rRNA} carryover during {RNA}-seq analysis. Presently, we evaluated the efficiency of three subtractive hybridization-based kits in depleting {rRNA} from samples derived from biofilm, as well as planktonic cells of the opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Our results indicated different {rRNA} removal efficiency for the three procedures, with the Ribo-Zero kit yielding the highest degree of {rRNA} depletion, which translated into enhanced enrichment of non-{rRNA} transcripts and increased depth of {RNA}-seq coverage.

Exposure to plasticizer alone had a similar effect on soil nitrogen parameters but microplastics of pure {PVC} polymer (either granule or film) had little effect over 60 days, indicating that phthalate plasticizer released from microplastics was the main driver of effects observed. Furthermore, a direct link between phthalate plasticizer, microbial taxonomic changes and altered nitrogen metabolism was established by the isolation of phthalate-degrading bacteria involved in nitrogen cycling. This study highlights the importance of chemical additives in determining the interplay of microplastics with microbes and nutrient cycling, which needs to be considered in future studies.},

Here we integrate contemporary scientific knowledge regarding the ecological, host-specific, and environmental forces shaping the diversity, specificity, and distribution of microbial symbionts within the coral holobiont, explore physiological pathways that contribute to holobiont fitness, and describe potential mechanisms for holobiont homeostasis. Understanding the role of the microbiome in coral resilience, acclimation, and environmental adaptation is a new frontier in reef science that will require large-scale collaborative research efforts.},

	abstract = {Reef-building corals harbour an astonishing diversity of microorganisms, including endosymbiotic microalgae, bacteria, archaea, and fungi. The metabolic interactions within this symbiotic consortium are fundamental to the ecological success of corals and the unique productivity of coral reef ecosystems. Over the last two decades, scientific efforts have been primarily channelled into dissecting the symbioses occurring in coral tissues. Although easily accessible, this compartment is only 2–3 mm thick, whereas the underlying calcium carbonate skeleton occupies the vast internal volume of corals. Far from being devoid of life, the skeleton harbours a wide array of algae, endolithic fungi, heterotrophic bacteria, and other boring eukaryotes, often forming distinct bands visible to the bare eye. Some of the critical functions of these endolithic microorganisms in coral health, such as nutrient cycling and metabolite transfer, which could enable the survival of corals during thermal stress, have long been demonstrated. In addition, some of these microorganisms can dissolve calcium carbonate, weakening the coral skeleton and therefore may play a major role in reef erosion. Yet, experimental data are wanting due to methodological limitations. Recent technological and conceptual advances now allow us to tease apart the complex physical, ecological, and chemical interactions at the heart of coral endolithic microbial communities. These new capabilities have resulted in an excellent body of research and provide an exciting outlook to further address the functional microbial ecology of the “overlooked” coral skeleton.},

This review focused on the effects of plastics (single toxicity) and associated chemicals (combined or leachate toxicities) on freshwater and marine microalgae. Forty-seven publications from 2010 to 2020 were used in this review. Based on their topic of focus, we classified the publications among the following categories: single plastic toxicity, combined toxicity of plastics and other chemicals, and toxicity of leachates released from plastics. The test species Chlorophyta and Ochrophyta were generally used to assess the impacts of plastics on aquatic microalgae. This study identified the inhibition of algal growth and photosynthesis due to single toxicity through the physical adsorption of plastics, showing that leachates released from plastics contained non-specific chem­ icals which could potentially affect microalgae. Production of malondialdehyde or reactive oxygen species presented significant effects on algae independent of the experimental conditions. This review could improve our understanding of the effects of plastic pollution on microalgae in freshwater and marine environments. It has implications for further research in this field and associated water management in light of the global ubiquity of plastic pollution.},

We studied the photophysiology of the oral and aboral symbiont band of scleractinian coral Montastrea curta to investigate if different acclimation to light exist in hospite on a polyp scale. By combined use of electrochemical and fiber-optic microsensors for O2, scalar irradiance and variable chlorophyll fluorescence, we could characterize the physical and chemical microenvironment experienced by the symbionts and, for the first time, estimate effective quantum yields of {PSII} photochemistry and rates of electron transport at the position of the zooxanthellae corrected for the in-tissue gradient of scalar irradiance. The oral- and aboral Symbiodinium layers received ∼71\% and ∼33\% of surface scalar irradiance, respectively, and the two symbiont layers experience considerable differences in light exposure. Rates of gross photosynthesis did not differ markedly between the oral- and aboral layer and curves of {PSII} electron transport rates corrected for scalar irradiance in hospite, showed that the light use efficiency under sub-saturating light conditions were similar between the two layers. However, the aboral Symbiodinium band did not experience photosynthetic saturation, even at the highest investigated irradiance where the oral layer was clearly saturated. We thus found a different light acclimation response for the oral and aboral symbiont bands in hospite, and discuss whether such response could be shaped by spectral shifts caused by tissue gradients of scalar irradiance. Based on our experimental finding, combined with previous knowledge, we present a conceptual model on the photophysiology of Symbiodinium residing inside living coral tissue under natural gradients of light and chemical parameters.},

	abstract = {The plasticizer di (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate ({DEHP}) is becoming increasingly abundant throughout the global environment as plastic pollution becomes highly severe, especially in the ocean. The adverse effects of {DEHP} have garnered increasing concern as they are recognized as endocrine disruptors. However, information on the effects of {DEHP} in marine organisms remains limited. In this study, acute toxic effects on marine medaka (Oryzias melastigma) following {DEHP} exposure were investigated. Transcriptome analysis was performed on the livers of medaka exposed to {DEHP} for 6 and 24 h. Results showed that 1595 genes were affected in all the analyzed specimens, and several genes expressed variably according to sex. Some pathways associated with immunity, metabolism, and endocrine system were significantly enriched, with the complement system appearing to be the most affected immune pathway. Pathway enrichment indicated that, under acute {DEHP} exposure, the immune response of females tended to be more sensitive than that of males. In addition, ferroptosis occurred in response to {DEHP} exposure, which resulted in an enrichment of the ferroptosis pathway along with iron overload, an increase in malondialdehyde ({MDA}) and lipid peroxidation ({LPO}) content, and a decrease in glutathione ({GSH}) levels. These results indicate that a form of cell death characterized by iron-dependence occurred following {DEHP} exposure, but the underlying mechanism requires further analysis. This study implies that {DEHP} can alter some molecular regulation patterns within a short period and induce cell death through ferroptosis.},

Through a factorial design, we investigated the gametogenesis cycle and sex-related expression of genes involved in {pH} homeostasis, stress response and oestrogen receptor-like pathways after the exposure to the two environmental stressors. As expected, we found sex-related differences in the proportion of developing, mature and spawning gonads in histological sections. Male gonads also showed higher levels of the acid–base regulator {CA}2, but females had a higher expression of stress response-related genes (i.e. sod, cat, hsp70). We found a significant effect of {DEHP} on stress response-related gene expression that was dependent on the gametogenesis stage, but there was only a trend towards downregulation of {CA}2 in response to {pH} 7.7. In addition, differences in gene expression between males and females were most pronounced in experimental conditions containing {DEHP} and/or acidified {pH} but never the control, indicating that it is important to consider sex and gametogenesis stage when studying the response of mussels to diverse stressors.},

However, there is limited information about the potentially hazardous impact of bisphenol A ({BPA}) and di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate ({DEHP}) on the marine environment. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of {BPA} and {DEHP} on the immune response of the intertidal mud crab, Macrophthalmus japonicus. In order to examine immunological responses involving the prophenoloxidase ({proPO}) system, {mRNA} transcript and activity levels of six immune-related genes, including lipopolysaccharide and β-1,3-glucan-binding protein ({LGBP}), {proPO}, phenoloxidase ({PO}), peroxinectin ({PE}), serine protease inhibitor (Serpin), and trypsin (Tryp), were assessed in M. japonicus hepatopancreas and gills exposed to {BPA} or {DEHP}. Expression of immune genes generally decreased in M. japonicus hepatopancreas and gills exposed to all concentrations of {BPA} by days 4 and 7. However, at day 1, expression of Serpin and Tryp genes was significantly increased in M. japonicus hepatopancreas and gills exposed to {BPA}. For {DEHP} exposure, all genes, with the exception of Serpin, were significantly downregulated in M. japonicus gills. In the hepatopancreas, gene expression of {PO}, {proPO}, and {LGBP} increased at day 1, and then decreased by day 7, while {mRNA} expression of Serpin and Tryp exhibited up-regulation over all exposure periods. In addition, {PE} gene expression was upregulated in hepatopancreas at day 7 in a dose-dependent manner. Taken together, these results indicated that the crab immune responses were perturbed by exposure to {BPA}, and, in particular, {DEHP}.},

	abstract = {Commensal microbial communities have immense effects on their vertebrate hosts, contributing to a number of physiological functions, as well as host ﬁtness. In particular, host immunity is strongly linked to microbiota composition through poorly understood bi-directional links. Gene expression may be a potential mediator of these links between microbial communities and host function. However, few studies have investigated connections between microbiota composition and expression of host immune genes in complex systems. Here, we leverage a large study of laboratory-raised ﬁsh from the species Gasterosteus aculeatus (three-spined stickleback) to document correlations between gene expression and microbiome composition. First, we examined correlations between microbiome alpha diversity and gene expression. Our results demonstrate robust positive associations between microbial alpha diversity and expression of host immune genes. Next, we examined correlations between host gene expression and abundance of microbial taxa. We identiﬁed 15 microbial families that were highly correlated with host gene expression. These families were all tightly correlated with host expression of immune genes and processes, falling into one of three categories—those positively correlated, negatively correlated, and neutrally related to immune processes. Furthermore, we highlight several important immune processes that are commonly associated with the abundance of these taxa, including both macrophage and B cell functions. Further functional characterization of microbial taxa will help disentangle the mechanisms of the correlations described here. In sum, our study supports prevailing hypotheses of intimate links between host immunity and gut microbiome composition.},
