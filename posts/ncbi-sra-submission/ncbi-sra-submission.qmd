So you got an email from Azenta saying your files are ready for download! Exciting! It's the moment we've been waiting for. What next??

# Background research

-   Watch this 10min video tutorial: [How to Submit to SRA, A Beginner's Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTg9Ru68fc0)

-   Read the [SRA Submission Wizard Help](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/docs/submitportal/) page

# Log in to NCBI

Navigate to the NCBI Submission Portal: <https://submit.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/>

Click on `SRA` to continue to the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) submission portal: <https://submit.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/about/sra/>

Log-in through a partner sign-in, or sign-up directly with NCBI to create an account.

I signed in using my existing ORC-ID account, and authorized NCBI to access my ORCID record.

Using my orcid, I created a new NCBI account.

I was prompted to update my profile and confirm my primary email address in order to be able to submit to SRA.
