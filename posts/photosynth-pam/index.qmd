## A brief review of photosynthesis

PAM fluorescense measurements analyze the state and turnover of photosystem II reaction centers. Combined with oxygen consumption, we an assess the role of alternative oxygen-processing pathways.

The MINI-PAM-II uses an oxygen optode, the sensor's responsive element is a luminescent dye whose light emission is quenched by oxygen. The optode measurement does not consume oxygen.

What is fluorescence?

Pulse Amplitude Modulation (PAM) Fluorometers use three different lights to trigger the photosynthetic apparatus and chlorophyll-a molecule.

-   weak measuring light

-   saturating pulse

-   actinic light
