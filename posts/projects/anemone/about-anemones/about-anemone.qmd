# *What are Anthopleura elegantissima?*

![A boulder covered in A. elegantissima anemones at Owens Beach near Point Defiance, Tacoma, Washington](/posts/projects/anemone/field-collection/field-pics/1/PXL_20240319_011553108.jpg)

*Anthopleura elegantissima* are clonal intertidal anemones that can form flexible symbiotic partnerships with different single-celled algae which provide supplemental sugars to their diet, or alternatively, they can live 'aposymbiotically', relying wholly on prey capture for their food. They are commonly called the 'aggregating anemone', or 'clonal-anemone' because they form large clonal aggregates. Another common-name is the 'pink-tipped anemone', because of the pink tinge to the tips of their tentacles. As shown in the image above, they can completely cover large boulders in the intertidal zone with hundreds of individuals that are all genetic clones of each other.

> "This anemone is an effective predator living in zooplankton-rich water, so one would not expect it to be as nutrient-limited, nor as dependent on algal photosynthetic productivity as its tropical symbiotic counterparts. It is also adapted to prolonged aerial exposure and greater temperature extremes; the animal feeds and its symbionts photosynthesize at temperatures approaching 5°C." - @mccloskey1996

## Taxonomy

The aggregating anemone was first described in scientific literature by Johann-Friedrich Brandt in 1835. Their taxonomic name, *Anthopleura elegantissima (Brandt 1835)*, is thus tied to a latin description which can be translated:

> "The body is large, pustular, red, green, blue, or brown, or even spotted with green and purple. The disc is oval, with a white striated margin and a sub-pentangular margin of half a foot in diameter. The tentacles at the base and apex are narrowed and widened white, the apex is purple, marked with a purple band in the middle. On the shores of the island of Sitka."

[![This original description of what is now called *Anthopleura elegantissima*, but was originally '*Actinia elegantissima*' was made by Johann-Friedrich Brandt in 1835. This description was published in latin, in a book titled 'Prodromus descriptionis animalium ab H. Mertensio observatorum : fascic. I. Polypos, Acalephas Discophoras et Siphonophoras, nec non Echinodermata continens' in St. Petersburg, Russia](brandt1835.png)](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/10765502)

Brandt was a German-Russian naturalist who was director of the Zoological Museum of St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences and described speciments from the expeditions of explorers off the Pacific Coast of North America. He may be best known for the description of birds like 'Brandt's cormorant' and the spectacled eider. This original description by Brandt in 1835 suggests that the collection and description of this anemone species in Sitka[^1] was done in conjuction with colonial expansion and oppression.

[^1]: In 1799 Captain Alexander Baranov, General Manager of the Shelikov-Golikov Company, establishes Sitka as a trading post as the first Russian trading charter grants the Russian-American Company sole trading rights in America for 20 years. Sitka is a strategic and important trading location and was already the indigineous homelands a large Tlingit village. Years of conflict with indigenous Koniag, Aleut, Tlingit, and colonial oppression as well as the Battles of Sitka in 1802 & 1804 predate and contextualize the timeframe in which Russian naturalists were 'discovering' new species in North America.

# Where are aggregating anemones found?

From Baja California to Southeast Alaska all along the Eastern Pacific Coast.

[![Anthopleura elegantissima distribution from the WORMS database](WORMS_distribution.png)](https://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id=283347#distributions)

***A. elegantissima*** **is very tolerant to a broad range of thermal exposures.** As an intertidal organism, *A. elegantissima* regularly experience large temperature shifts throughout the day coinciding with desiccation at low tide. They are found from Baja, California to Southeast Alaska, and in anemones hosting the brown alga *Breviolum muscatinei*, temperatures from 6^o^C to 24^o^C do not significantly affect their algal density, mitotic index, or total chlorophyll (a + c), but net photosynthesis and anemone respiration both increase with temperature [@Verde.2002].

# How are they studied?

## Wet weight, oral disc diameter and protein content

In a paper @dimond2011, a year-long survey of *Anthopleura elegantissima* anemones to assess seasonality provides background information about the seasonal variation in anemone size and symbiosis.

> "Anemone biomass and symbiosis—All metrics of anemone size (Table 1) indicated significant seasonal variation (protein biomass, F3,286 5 12.9, p , 0.001; wet weight, F3,287 5 3.52, p 5 0.02; oral disk diameter, F3,287 5 9.60, p , 0.001). There were no significant shore height differences in any measure (protein biomass, F2,286 5 2.36, p 5 0.09; wet weight, F2,287 5 1.97, p 5 0.14; oral disk diameter, F2,287 5 1.35, p 5 0.26) and no significant interaction effects (protein biomass, F6,286 5 0.84, p 5 0.54; wet weight, F6,287 5 0.96, p 5 0.45; oral disk diameter, F6,287 5 1.24, p 5 0.29). Wet weight was a better predictor of protein biomass than was oral disk diameter (Table 1). However, although protein biomass was significantly higher in November than in all other months, wet weight was not significantly different among July, November, and February." - @dimond2011

## Animal husbandry

In the paper by @mccloskey1996 the anemone's were fed every other day with \~30mg of freshly hatched *Artemia nauplii* and maintained for 22 days with a single anemone each in its own 100mL jar, with seawater replaced every other day at 14°C ±2°C.

In the study by @dimond2017, anemones were housed in 200mL glass beakers in a seawater flow-through tank as a bath, with the water level just below the top of the beakers.

### Irradiance of B. muscatinei hosting Anemones

McFarland & Muller-Parker 1993 report greater photosynthetic productivity in the brown dinoflagellate (\*B. muscatinei\*) compared to the green chlorophyte, especially at higher irradiances. *B. muscatinei*

For anemones hosting *B. muscatinei* :

> -   Maximum midday irradiance usually exceeded $2,000 mu/ mol m^{-2} s^{-1}$ , where no photoinhibition was observed (Verde & McCloskey 1996)
>
> -   Under experimental manipulations in the laboratory, ZX photosynthetic rates were suppressed at 2,000 lmolÆm--2Æs--1, indicative of photoinhibition (see below). Photoinhibitory phenomena are often associated with damage to the photosynthetic apparatus. If so, the ZX would likely devote more energy and resources to damage control and repair; subsequently less energy and photosynthetic products would be available to support continued algal growth. Since ZX also displayed photoinhibition at 1,400 lmolÆm--2Æs--1, yet did not show a reduction in MI, the onset of the deleterious effects of damage repair would seem to occur at intensities above 1,400 lmolÆm--2Æ s--1. In contrast, anemone metabolic rates were elevated at 2,000 lmolÆm--2Æs--1; it may simply be that the host requires more energy and organic resources to meet its elevated respiratory demands, and the ZX symbiont provides both at the expense of its own growth @e.2002.
>
> -   Not light saturated up to $550 mu/ mol m^{-2} s^{-1}$ (Verde & McCloskey 1996)
>
> -   *B. muscatinei* peaked at \$800 mu/ mol m\^{-2} s\^{-1}\$ @e.2002 .

## Symbiosis

***A. elegantissima*** **gains symbionts through horizontal transmission** [@lajeunesse2000a]**. (Trench 1987)**

Normally, *A. elegantissima* expels symbionts from its coelenteron in a bolus of mucus and undigested material. Expulsion of symbionts should not be confused with "bleaching" phenomenon in reef corals, and may serve an ulterior purpose and undergo a different process. The anemones 'cull' or 'weed' the symbionts to maintain an optimal symbiont population density.

The optimized symbiont density is reported in the literature as 10^6^ cells·mg^-1^ of host protein and 1-5·10^6^ cells·cm^-2^ [@mccloskey1996].

> Sea anemones of the genus Anthopleura along northeast Pacific intertidal shores engage in a particularly unique symbiosis with two especially phylogenetically and physiologically different symbionts: the chlorophyte *Elliptochloris marina* (Letsch et al., 2009) and the dinoflagellate *Symbiodinium muscatinei* (LaJeunesse and Trench, 2000). - @dimond2017

The *Symbiodinium muscatinei*[@lajeunesse2000a]were reclassified as *Breviolum muscatinei*

Most anemones only host one symbiont, or the other. It is rare for mixed assemblages of the two 'symbiont morphs' to occur. In the paper by @mccloskey1996, they found that among 91 anemones, \>95% had a single symbiont type. The chlorophyte *Elliptochloris marina* is relatively sensitive to light and is limited to cooler, low light environments typical of the low intertidal. The dinoflagellate *B. muscatinei*, on the other hand, tolerates higher light and temperatures and is more commonly found in anemones in the upper intertidal zone. Aposymbiotic (non-symbiont forming) *A. elegantissima* anemones can be found thriving in very low light conditions, often inside rocky crevasses within the intertidal zone. Transplantation of *A. elegantissima* anemones with chlorophyte *E. marina* symbionts to warmer, higher-light environments results in shifts in the symbiont population from *E. marina* to *B. muscatinei* [@dimond2017].

Anemones hosting *B. muscatinei* have a golden-brown color, while those that host *E. marina* are mossy green. Symbiont type can be verified by viewing excised tentacles under light microscopy, and commonly, no mixed-symbiont populations are observed [@dimond2017].
