  abstract = {The mosshead sculpin               Clinocottus globiceps               (Girard, 1857) feeds on the sea anemone               Anthopleuru elegantissima               that contains two different algal endosymbionts, zooxanthellae and zoochlorellae. During laboratory feeding experiments, the sculpin selectively fed on the tentacles of zooxanthellate anemones over those of zoochlorellate and algae‐free anemones. Zoochlorellae passed through the fish gut unharmed while zooxanthellae were degraded. The productivity of zooxanthellae in the fish feces (0.20 ± 0.13 pg C cell               −1               h               −1               ) was significantly lower (93\% less) than that of zooxanthellae freshly isolated from anemones (3.14 ± 0.52 pg C cell               −1               h               −1               ), whereas the productivity of fecal zoochlorellae was the same as that of freshly isolated zoochlorellae (1.21 ± 0.15 pg C cell               −1               h               −1               ). The chlorophyll content (Chl               a               and               c               ) of zooxanthellae was reduced by 50\% after passage through the fish gut while the chlorophyll content of zoochlorellae (Chl               a               and               b               ) did not change. Selective predation on zooxanthellate anemones confers several ecological advantages to zoochlorellate anemones and to zoochlorellae, most notably predator avoidance and dispersal of viable zoochlorellae that may serve as a source of symbionts for other anemones. By influencing the outcome of predator‐prey interactions involving their hosts, symbiotic algae may have broader ecological roles in benthic communities than previously described.},

  abstract = {Microplastics are anthropogenic contaminants found in coastal and marine environments worldwide. Pacific razor clams (Siliqua patula), important for local indigenous culture, economy, gastronomy and food security along the United States West Coast, are subjected to myriad environmental stressors including predation, storm events, disease, toxins, and microplastics. This study aimed to determine microplastic burdens in Olympic Coast, Washington Pacific razor clams and estimate annual microplastic exposure of recreational razor clam harvester-consumers from eating this species. We quantified suspected microplastic burdens in Pacific razor clams collected from eight tribal, recreational, and commercial harvest areas on the Olympic Coast in April 2018. We administered questionnaires to 107 recreational razor clam harvesters during the same timeframe to determine consumption patterns, preparation styles, knowledge and concerns about microplastics, and demographics. Razor clams containing suspected microplastics, primarily microfibers, were found at all eight sites. Average suspected microplastic burden differed by sample type (whole= 6.75 ± 0.60, gut-tissue= 7.88 ± 0.71, non-gut tissue= 4.96 ± 0.56, and cleaned samples= 3.44 ± 0.25). FTIR analyses of a random subset of microfibers in whole and cleaned clams indicated material types of polyethylene terephthalate, cellulose acetate, cellophane, polyester, nylon, and cellulose. The average number of razor clams consumed per meal by Olympic Coast recreational razor clam harvesters was 4.27 ± 0.27, which varied by gender and ethnicity, but not income or age. Harvesters ate 0–209 meals/year of razor clams (16.2\% harvested but did not eat razor clams), and most respondents (88.3\%) fully cleaned razor clams before consuming them. Annual suspected microplastic exposure for razor clam harvester-consumers was 60–3,070 pieces for cleaned and 120–6,020 for whole clams. Our findings suggest Olympic Coast recreational razor clam harvester-consumers are exposed to low levels of microplastics from eating razor clams. Microplastic exposure can be reduced by roughly 50\% if clams are cleaned before consumption. Our work serves as an important reference in the growing portfolio of Pacific Northwest microplastic research, to inform future microplastic attenuation recommendations and development of human health standards for this type of pollution.},

  abstract = {The use of DMSO for the extraction and determination of chlorophylls a and b in lichens and higher plants was reevaluated. Because of differences between the absorption spectra of pure chlorophylls a and b in DMSO and 80\% acetone, formulae to calculate the individual concentrations of chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b and total (a + b) chlorophyll in pigment extracts were redetermined for specific use with DMSO. In lichens, the problem of chlorophyll degradation resulting from the presence of acidic lichen substances was specifically addressed. Repeated washing of thalli with carbonate-saturated 100\% acetone followed by extraction in DMSO containing PVPi minimized the conversion of chlorophylls to phaeophytin during extraction of chlorophylls from lichens for which the content of lichen substances was characterized. In lichens containing significant quantities of acidic compounds, the modified DMSO assay proved superior to 80\% acetone for the extraction and determination of chlorophyll a and b concentrations. In a range of higher plants, determinations of chlorophyll a and b concentrations were virtually identical when the modified DMSO assay was compared with the traditional method of chlorophyll extraction using 80\% acetone. Moreover, DMSO extracts could be cold-stored for up to 7 days with no significant loss of chlorophylls a or b, or changes in the a/b ratio. Potential eco-physiological applications of the modified DMSO assay, which eliminates the necessity for grinding plant material and centrifuging plant extracts, are discussed.},

Anemones in tidepools and crevices had varying algal proportions: {$>$}0.90 ZC (green anemones), 0.10 to 0.90 ZX (mixed), and {$>$}0.90 ZX (brown). Brown anemones are primarily found in the high intertidal and the upper region of tidepools. Mixed anemones are most common at intermediate shore heights and green anemones are exclusive to the low shore and at increasing depth in tidepools. Microhabitat was also important to algal proportion, as anemones in crevices had greater proportions of ZC than anemones in tidepools at the same shore height. In a reciprocal transplant experiment, A. xanthogrammica were moved between high and low shallow tidepools. All anemones moved from a low to a high tidepool exhibited a shift from ZC to ZX populations, while the anemones transplanted from high to low tidepools maintained ZX dominance. This is the first documentation that field algal populations can shift from ZC to ZX in Anthopleura. The field survey and transplant study results support the hypothesis that the relative abundance of ZX and ZC in A. xanthogrammica is influenced by the environmental gradient associated with shore height and microhabitat.},

A seasonal comparison of zooxanthellate and zoochlorellate anemones showed stable symbiont population densities in summer and winter, with densities of zoochlorellae about 4 times those of zooxanthellae. Photosynthesis-irradiance curves of freshly isolated symbionts show that the productivity (\$P\_\{\textbackslash text\{max\}\}\$ cell) of freshly isolated zooxanthellae was about 2.5 times that of zoochlorellae during July; comparable rates were obtained in other months. Models of algal carbon flux show that zoochlorellae may supply the host with more photosynthetic carbon per unit anemone biomass than zooxanthellae supply. Zooxanthellate anemone tissue was 2‰ (¹³C) and 5‰ (¹⁵N) enriched and zoochlorellate anemone tissue was 6‰ (¹³C) and 8‰ (¹⁵N) enriched over their respective symbionts, suggesting that zoochlorellate anemones receive less nutrition from their symbionts than do zooxanthellate individuals. The disparity between predicted contributions from the algal carbon budgets and the stable isotopic composition suggests that short-term measures of algal contributions may not reflect actual nutritional inputs to the host. Isotopic data support the hypothesis of substantial reliance on external food sources. This additional nutrition may allow both algae to persist in this temperate intertidal anemone in spite of differences in seasonal photosynthetic carbon contributions.},

  abstract = {The sea anemone Anthopleura elegantissima is a common member of intertidal communities along the west coast of North America, and can experience extended periods of increased temperature during summertime low tides. Internal body temperatures of emersed individuals of A. elegantissima were monitored in a laboratory wind tunnel and in the field, and factors influencing the anemones’ thermal experience were examined. Larger body size and aggregation with conspecifics slowed body temperature increases in controlled wind tunnel conditions. In the field, anemones in the interior of an aggregation stayed cooler than those on the edges, and microhabitat features related to light exposure and surface orientation overshadowed any direct effects of body size. In the warmest month only (July), aggregations of A. elegantissima were significantly larger at the upper limit of their distribution than they were at the mid and lower limits, suggesting aggregation in high intertidal zones may be a behavioral response to desiccation and temperature stress. As this sea anemone can host multiple species of symbiotic algae with different thermal tolerances, the ability to slow body heating may affect the type of algae hosted and thus the potential contribution of this abundant anemone to primary production in the intertidal zone.},

Here we report the next stage in this coevolutionary arms race, using the Illumina GAIIx platform to sequence a diverse array of 25 environmental samples and three known “mock communities” at a depth averaging 3.1 million reads per sample. We demonstrate excellent consistency in taxonomic recovery and recapture diversity patterns that were previously reported on the basis of metaanalysis of many studies from the literature (notably, the saline/nonsaline split in environmental samples and the split between host-associated and free-living communities). We also demonstrate that 2,000 Illumina single-end reads are sufficient to recapture the same relationships among samples that we observe with the full dataset. The results thus open up the possibility of conducting large-scale studies analyzing thousands of samples simultaneously to survey microbial communities at an unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution.},

  abstract = {A delicate relationship exists between reef-building corals and their photosynthetic endosymbionts. Unfortunately, this relationship can be disrupted, with corals expelling these algae when temperatures rise even marginally above the average summer maximum. Interestingly, several studies indicate that failure of corals to regulate symbiont cell divisions at high temperatures may underlie this disruption; increased proliferation of symbionts may stress host cells by over-production of reactive oxygen species or by disrupting the flow of nutrients. This needs to be further investigated, so to begin deciphering the molecular mechanisms controlling the cell cycle in these organisms, we used a computational approach to identify putative cell cycle-regulating genes in the genome of the dinoflagellate Breviolum minutum. This species is important as an endosymbiont of Aiptasia pallida—an anemone that is used as a model for studying coral biology. We then correlated expression of these putative cell cycle genes with cell cycle phase in diurnally growing B. minutum in culture. This approach allowed us to identify a cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinase pair that may function in the G1/S transition—a likely point for coral cells to exert control over algal cell divisions.},

As such, chemical additives may be released into the environment, which can affect marine organisms; however, studies of the effects of such additives are lacking. We assessed the effects of leachate from EPS on the photosynthetic activities of four microalgal species (Dunaliella salina, Scenedesmus rubescens, Chlorella saccharophila, and Stichococcus bacillaris). They were exposed to EPS leachate for seven days and their photosynthetic activities were analyzed based on seven parameters. Overall, leachate exposure increased photosynthetic activity in all four species, albeit to different degrees and showing slightly different trends among the seven parameters. Based on chemical analysis, hexabromocyclododecane concentrations were higher in small-fragment leachate, whereas UV326 concentrations were higher in low-concentration-large-sphere leachate; bisphenol-A and total organic carbon showed no major differences among leachates. Thus, we speculate that exposure to trace chemicals influenced microalgal photosynthesis and overall growth. These results support further investigation of the impacts of plastic debris and chemical additives on marine ecosystems and organisms.},

  abstract = {Prospects for coral persistence through increasingly frequent and extended heatwaves seem bleak. Coral recovery from bleaching is only known to occur after temperatures return to normal, and mitigation of local stressors does not appear to augment coral survival. Capitalizing on a natural experiment in the equatorial Pacific, we track individual coral colonies at sites spanning a gradient of local anthropogenic disturbance through a tropical heatwave of unprecedented duration. Unexpectedly, some corals survived the event by recovering from bleaching while still at elevated temperatures. These corals initially had heat-sensitive algal symbiont communities, endured bleaching, and then recovered through proliferation of heat-tolerant symbionts. This pathway to survival only occurred in the absence of strong local stressors. In contrast, corals in highly disturbed areas were already dominated by heat-tolerant symbionts, and despite initially resisting bleaching, these corals had no survival advantage in one species and 3.3 times lower survival in the other. These unanticipated connections between disturbance, coral symbioses and heat stress resilience reveal multiple pathways to coral survival through future prolonged heatwaves.},

Though organisms have been shown to ingest tire particles (TPs), past research focused on toxicity of leachate alone, overlooking potential effects of particles. To address these gaps, we assessed the toxicity of micro (1–20 µm) and nano ({$<$}1 µm) TPs for two model organisms, embryonic Zebrafish Danio rerio and the crustacean Daphnia magna. To assess effects on development, Zebrafish embryos were exposed to concentrations of TPs or leachate ranging from 0 to 3.0 × 109 particles/ml and 0–100\% respectively (n = 4). Greater mortality and sublethal malformations were observed following nano TP and leachate exposures as compared to micro TPs. Unique abnormalities between the exposures indicates that there is both chemical and particle-specific toxicity. We also observed D. magna mortality following a 48 h exposure of neonate to TPs or leachate, ranging from 0 to 3.3 × 109 particles/ml and 0–100\% respectively (n = 3). Though, particleenhancement of toxicity was observed for both Zebrafish and D. magna, overall sensitivity to TPs differed. It is important to identify differential toxicities across species to achieve an understanding of the environmental impacts of TPs and the chemicals they leach.},

  abstract = {The breakdown of the symbiosis between cnidarians and Symbiodiniaceae often occurs upon periods of elevated sea surface temperature and gives rise to bleaching events that affect coral reefs worldwide. In this respect, an impairment of photosynthesis would be responsible for light-dependent generation of toxic reactive oxygen species putatively contributing to death of symbionts and/or host cells. In some Symbiodiniaceae species, alternative photosynthetic electron flows (AEF) have been documented to occur upon a shift to high temperature, possibly contributing to photoprotection and to the balance of energetic ratio between photoproduced ATP and NADPH. By using a combination of in vivo spectrofluorimetric and oximetric techniques, we studied the capacity for electron rerouting toward oxygen and cyclic electron flow (CEF) around photosystem I in eight Symbiodiniaceae in culture belonging to Symbiodinium and Breviolum genera upon an acute shift from 25 to 33◦C. CEF capacity was determined as the kinetic of PSI primary donor P700 re-reduction in the presence of DCMU, a PSII inhibitor. An active oxygen uptake in light was estimated by comparing net oxygen evolution and relative electron transport rate of PSII at different light intensities. Among strains that showed elevated capacity for both AEF, some were thermotolerant while others were thermosensitive. Conversely, in some thermotolerant strains, capacities for these AEF were low upon acute heat stress. A principal component analysis of these results indicates that the long-term heat tolerant/bleached phenotype of cultured Symbiodinium and Breviolum spp. is not correlated with a capacity for different AEF across isolates during early onset of acute heat stress.},

Random collection of anemones along repeatedly sampled transects over four seasons and three shore heights revealed S. muscatinei to be the dominant symbiont, with E. marina mostly limited to anemones in the lower intertidal zone. At the lowest shore height sampled (+0.2 m), the proportion of E. marina was between 40\% and 50\% of the total symbiont population throughout the year. Symbiont distribution patterns persisted despite considerable seasonal variation in aerial exposure, temperature, irradiance, nutrients, and phytoplankton concentration, as well as a high potential for symbiont shuffling, with mixed-symbiont assemblages occurring in 51\% of all anemones sampled. Symbiont density in anemones also changed little despite three- to fourfold-higher division frequencies of both symbionts during July and November. Although the intertidal zonation of these symbionts was stable over an annual period, we predict that their spatial distributions will be responsive to longer-term environmental change, and anticipate that this anemone symbiosis will be a useful and highly tractable barometer for future climate change, with this study serving as a baseline.},

  abstract = {For cnidarians that can undergo shifts in algal symbiont relative abundance, the underlying algal physiological changes that accompany these shifts are not well known. The sea anemone Anthopleura elegantissima associates with the dinoflagellate Symbiodinium muscatinei and the chlorophyte Elliptochloris marina, symbionts with very different tolerances to light and temperature. We compared the performance of these symbionts in anemones maintained in an 8–11.5 month outdoor common garden experiment with simulated intertidal conditions and three levels of shading (2, 43, and 85\% ambient irradiance). Symbiont densities, mitotic indices, photophysiology and pigments were assessed at three time points during the summer, a period of high irradiance and solar heating during aerial exposure. Whereas S. muscatinei was either neutrally or positively affected by higher irradiance treatments, E. marina responded mostly negatively to high irradiance. E. marina in the 85\% irradiance treatment exhibited significantly reduced Pmax and chlorophyll early in the summer, but it was not until nearly 3 months later that a shift in symbiont relative abundance toward S. muscatinei occurred, coincident with bleaching. Symbiont densities and proportions remained largely stable in all other treatments over time, and displacement of S. muscatinei by E. marina was not observed in the 2\% irradiance treatment despite the potentially better performance of E. marina. While our results support the view that rapid changes in symbiont relative abundance are typically associated with symbiont physiological dysfunction and bleaching, they also show that significant temporal lags may occur between the onset of symbiont stress and shifts in symbiont relative abundances.},

  abstract = {Associating with algal symbionts is considered largely beneficial for cnidarians such as corals and sea anemones, yet there are potential costs of hosting symbionts, such as the production of reactive oxygen species. We compared the photophysiology and H2O2 production rates of Symbiodinium muscatinei and Elliptochloris marina, the dinoflagellate and chlorophyte symbionts, respectively, of the temperate sea anemone Anthopleura elegantissima. Analyses of photosystem II (PSII) function in the two symbionts, including maximum quantum yield and relative electron transport rates, were consistent with prior studies indicating that E. marina has lower photosynthetic performance than S. muscatinei at high temperature and irradiance. The efficiency of PSII in both symbionts was positively affected by the addition of exogenous catalase, suggesting that both symbionts experience H2O2-mediated declines in PSII efficiency. We found that S. muscatinei produced more H2O2 than E. marina across all treatments, with the highest production under high light and temperature. Results were similar in experiments involving both isolated symbionts and symbionts residing within intact tentacles, indicating that the potential stress of symbiont isolation was not a significant factor biasing our results. Despite the lower typical densities of S. muscatinei relative to E. marina, extrapolations of cell-specific H2O2 production rates to the intact symbiosis suggest that S. muscatinei imposes a greater H2O2 burden on A. elegantissima. Even with this burden, however, the considerably higher productivity and fitness of S. muscatinei-bearing anemones documented in prior studies suggests that the net benefit of hosting S. muscatinei exceeds that of E. marina.},

  abstract = {Symbiosis with protists is common among cnidarians such as corals and sea anemones, and is associated with homeostatic and phenotypic changes in the host that could have epigenetic underpinnings, such as methylation of CpG dinucleotides. We leveraged the sensitivity to base modifications of nanopore sequencing to probe the effect of symbiosis with the chlorophyte Elliptochloris marina on methylation in the sea anemone Anthopleura elegantissima. We first validated the approach by comparison of nanopore-derived methylation levels with CpG depletion analysis of a published transcriptome, finding that high methylation levels are associated with CpG depletion as expected. Next, using reads generated exclusively from aposymbiotic anemones, a largely complete draft genome comprising 243 Mb was assembled. Reads from aposymbiotic and symbiotic sea anemones were then mapped to this genome and assessed for methylation using the program Nanopolishwhich detects signal disruptions from base modifications as they pass through the nanopore. Based on assessment of 452,841 CpGs for which there was adequate read coverage (approximately 8\% of the CpGs in the genome), symbiosis with E. marina was, surprisingly, associated with only subtle changes in the host methylome. However, we did identify one extended genomic region with consistently higher methylation among symbiotic individuals. The region was associated with a DNA polymerase zeta that is noted for its role in translesion synthesis, which opens interesting questions about the biology of this symbiosis. Our study highlights the power and relative simplicity of nanopore sequencing for studies of nucleic acid base modifications in non-model species.},

I collected sediment from three 1 m2 quadrats on each beach of my 12 sample sites using the Beach Sampling Protocol from the Port Townsend Marine Science Center to ensure comparison of data with other studies. The results show a total of 1,776 microplastic pieces/m2 collected at all twelve beaches, with a weak connection between spatial distribution and population density of nearby cities. As beaches erode, these microplastics are transported into Puget Sound and the Pacific Ocean. It remains an open question of how many and how much of these microplastic particles are exported from the beaches into the ocean.},

The photosynthetic performances of this association were similar to those of marine phytoplankton and intertidal seaweeds. Light saturation for Anthopleura elegantissima occurred between 125–350μE · m−2 · s−1 and inhibition was not observed at intensities up to 1550 μE · m−2 · s−1. Weight-specific gross photosynthetic rates decreased with increasing anemone size and were similar for fed, starved, and newly collected anemones. Gross photosynthetic rates were positively correlated with chlorophyll a content and number of zooxanthellae. Weight-specific respiration rates also decreased with increasing anemone size. Fed anemones respired at rates about twice those of starved anemones and A. elegantissima measured within 10 h of collection had respiration rates similar to starved anemones. Gross photosynthesis to respiration (P : R) ratios were a function of the nutritional state of the anemones, typically ranging from 2.0 to 3.0 for starved anemones, but seldom over 1.0 for fed anemones. Estimates of the relative contribution of carbon from the zooxanthellae to the host (animal) respiratory carbon depended on host nutritional state, averaging ≈ 13\% for fed anemones and 45\% for starved or newly collected anemones. Photosynthetic rates were similar to temperate intertidal seaweeds having low surface to volume ratios. Calculations of the contributions of anemones to intertidal gross primary production (48–151 gC · m−2 · yr−1) fall within the range of temperate intertidal seaweed populations.},

Additives include bisphenols, phthalates, flame retardants, and further emerging and legacy contaminants. With a few exceptions, additives are not chemically bound to the polymer, and potentially migrate within the material reaching its surface, then possibly leach out to the environment. Leachates are mixtures of additives, some of which belong to the list of emerging contaminants, i.e. substances that show the potential to pose risks to the environment and human health, while are not yet regulated. The review discusses the state of the art and gaps concerning the hidden threat of plastic leachates. The focus is on reports addressing the biological impacts of plastic leachates as a whole mixture. Degradation of plastics, including the weathering-driven fragmentation, and the release of additives, are analysed together with the techniques currently employed for chemically screening leachates. Because marine plastic litter is a major concern, the review mainly focuses on the effects of plastic leachates on marine flora and fauna. Moreover, it also addresses impacts on freshwater organisms. Finally, research needs and perspectives are examined, to promote better focused investigations, that may support developing different plastic materials and new regulations.},

These characteristics have raised the demand for plastic materials that will continue to grow over the coming years. However, with increased plastic materials production, comes increased plastic material wastage creating a number of challenges, as well as opportunities to the waste management industry. The present overview highlights the waste management and pollution challenges, emphasising on the various chemical substances (known as “additives”) contained in all plastic products for enhancing polymer properties and prolonging their life. Despite how useful these additives are in the functionality of polymer products, their potential to contaminate soil, air, water and food is widely documented in literature and described herein. These additives can potentially migrate and undesirably lead to human exposure via e.g. food contact materials, such as packaging. They can, also, be released from plastics during the various recycling and recovery processes and from the products produced from recyclates. Thus, sound recycling has to be performed in such a way as to ensure that emission of substances of high concern and contamination of recycled products is avoided, ensuring environmental and human health protection, at all times.},

This research investigates the contribution of  microplastics to Puget Sound, Washington, via the Puyallup River from 2017 to 2018. Datasets  from UW Tacoma were analyzed to determine spatial and temporal variation of microplastic  abundance across nine sampling stations. The stations were located around the Puyallup River’s  nearby wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) as these plants act as possible sources of pollution.  A majority of the data indicated that microplastic abundance increased from 2017 to 2018  (P = 0.0287). Additionally, the data demonstrated a positive correlation between average  microplastic abundance per city and total population both years (2017 R2 = 0.8749,  2018 R2 = 0.6195). Although spatial results were variable, abundance increased in the Puyallup  River between the two sites closest to Puget Sound. 2018 data had a larger microplastic type  distribution than 2017 with 63 percent fiber and 37 percent fragment, while 2017 only had fibers.  Puyallup River results were compared to a study conducted on the Snohomish River in 2017.  Mean river microplastic abundance between the two sites showed no difference in 2017  (P = 0.0549) and a significant difference in 2018 (P = 0.0008). Regulations on anthropogenic  related pollution are necessary as microplastics continue to accumulate in the ocean. Further  research with larger datasets and over longer timescales is crucial for resolving variability in the  data and determining the impact plastic pollution has on marine communities.},

Macro-plastics (larger than 5 mm) and their effects on marine life have been well studied, documenting effects such as strangulation and digestive blockage in animals. Micro-plastics (0.3 mm to 5 mm in size), a result of either plastic produced in small pieces or fragmentation, have only recently begun being researched. This study characterizes macro and micro plastics in two NE Pacific estuaries, Puget Sound, WA and Nootka Sound, Canada. Macro-plastic concentrations were zero at all stations in both estuaries. Average micro-plastic concentrations at the surface ranged from 0 pieces/m3 to 102 pieces/m3, 5 m depth concentrations were 0 pieces/m3 to 44 pieces/m3 and 10 m depth concentrations were 0 pieces/m3 to 5300 pieces/m3. Fibers of plastic, assumed to be primarily marine in origin, had a higher concentration at most stations than those in pellet form, assumed to be terrestrial in origin. Understanding plastics’ distribution, origins, and effects on estuaries will require significant spatial and temporal sampling, beginning at the source.},

  abstract = {Microplastics (plastic {$<$} 5mm) are ubiquitous in marine environments, from surface waters to benthic sediments. Microplastic in the oceans was first documented in 2004 and our current knowledge of potential biological implications is limited and rapidly growing. Thus far, we know marine organisms are exposed to microplastics in natural settings, ingest microplastics, and experience negative physiological impacts. Many aspects of microplastics such as ingestion fate, extent of trophic transfer, and effect on marine ecosystems remain unknown. Motivated by the need to understand the impact microplastic pollution has on our environment and our lives, I investigated three aspects of the marine microplastic problem: impacts on marine organisms, the ecosystem they support, and the linkages between scientific research and public policy. 	In nature, mussels experience a wide range of particle types and concentrations, readily filtering microalgae and abiotic particles other than microplastic. Mussel clearance rate is sensitive to stress, making it a good indicator of stressful conditions and polluted environments. In Chapter 1, I compare mussel (Mytilus trossulus) clearance rates when exposed to two different abiotic particles, microplastic and silt, across multiple concentrations. I measure the clearance rates of mussels exposed to increasing concentrations of three particle treatments: Algae, microplastic + algae, and silt + algae. I found that mussel clearance rate was inhibited by high concentrations of microplastics but not silt. In the absence of microplastic, mussel clearance rate was not dependent on the addition of silt, total particle concentration, or algal concentration.  	Mussels readily ingest microplastics in natural and laboratory settings, raising concerns about particle fate. Mussels are key benthic-pelagic couplers, concentrating particles from the water column into dense and nutrient rich biodeposits. In Chapter 2, I evaluate how microplastic changes the benthic-pelagic coupling role of marine mussels (M. trossulus). I expose mussels to feeding regimes with and without microplastic and measure four attributes of biodeposits: morphology, quantity of algal and microplastic particles, sinking rate, and resuspension velocity. I found biodeposits from the algae treatment contained more algal cells on average than those from the microplastic treatment. Further, biodeposits from the microplastic treatment sank slower and resuspended at slower water velocities than biodeposits from the algae treatment.    	To combat plastic pollution, there is sufficient evidence that policies can lead to reduced plastic production and consumption both locally and globally. In Chapter 3, I examine global growth and spread of the marine microplastic field in conjunction with growth and spread of national plastic policies using scientometric and diffusion methods. I conduct systematic literature reviews of marine microplastic papers and national plastic policies through 2019. At a global level, marine microplastic research and national plastic policies have grown exponentially and remain in the early phases of growth and spatial diffusion. Marine microplastic publication spread at the institution level was best explained by a hybrid of expansion and relocation diffusion, while national plastic policy spread was best explained by expansion diffusion.  	Taken together, findings from Chapters 1 and 2 indicate mussels readily filter, ingest, and egest microplastics, demonstrating their ability to transport particles between benthic and pelagic habitats. When exposed to microplastics, decreased clearance rate may result in fewer particles removed from the water column and subsequently available to benthic organisms. Further, decreases in sinking rate and resuspension velocity of biodeposits containing microplastic may increase dispersal distances, thus leading to increased transport of both algal cells and microplastic particles away from mussel beds. While extent of marine microplastic research is not a good indicator of national plastic policies, both the scientific field and national efforts to reduce plastic pollution are spreading globally at exponential rates. Marine microplastic pollution is a local, regional, and global issue that require cross disciplinary attention from researchers and policy makers around the world.},

  abstract = {Anthropogenic debris including microparticles ({$<$}5 mm) are ubiquitous in marine environments. The Salish Sea experiences seasonal fluctuations in precipitation, river discharge, sewage overflow events, and tourism—all variables previously thought to have an impact on microparticle transport and concentrations. Our goals are two-fold: 1) describe long-term microparticle contamination data including concentration, type, and size; and 2) determine if seasonal microparticle concentrations are dependent on environmental or tourism variables in Elliott Bay, Salish Sea. We sampled 100 L of seawater at a depth of approximately 9 m at the Seattle Aquarium, Seattle, Washington State, United States, approximately every two weeks from 2019 through 2020 and used an oil extraction protocol to separate microparticles. We found that microparticle concentrations ranged from 0 to 0.64 particles L−1 and fibers were the most common type observed. Microparticle concentrations exhibited a breakpoint on 10 April 2020, where estimated slope and associated microparticle concentration significantly declined. Further, when considering both environmental as well as tourism variables, temporal microparticle concentration was best described by a mixed-effects model, with tourism as the fixed effect and the person counting microparticles as the random effect. Although monitoring efforts presented set out to identify effects of seasonality and interannual differences in microparticle concentrations, it instead captured an effect of decreased tourism due to the global Covid-19 pandemic. Long-term monitoring is critical to establish temporal microparticle concentrations and to help researchers understand if there are certain events, both seasonal and sporadic (e.g., rain events, tourism, or global pandemics), when the marine environment is more at risk from anthropogenic pollution.

We quantified the number of microfibres found in the stomachs of 734 sand lance and 205 herring that had been captured by an abundant seabird, the rhinoceros auklet (Cerorhinca monocerata). Sampling took place on six widely-dispersed breeding colonies in British Columbia, Canada, and Washington State, USA, over one to eight years. The North Pacific Ocean is a global hotspot for pollution, yet few sand lance (1.5\%) or herring (2.0\%) had ingested microfibres. In addition, there was no systematic relationship between the prevalence of microplastics in the fish stomachs vs. in waters around three of our study colonies (measured in an earlier study). Sampling at a single site (Protection Island, WA) in a single year (2016) yielded most (sand lance) or all (herring) of the microfibres recovered over the 30 colony-years of sampling involved in this study, yet no microfibres had been recovered there, in either species, in the previous year. We thus found no evidence that sand lance and herring currently act as major food-web conduits for microfibres along British Columbia's outer coast, nor that the local at-sea density of plastic necessarily determines how much plastic enters marine food webs via zooplanktivores. Extensive urban development around the Salish Sea probably explains the elevated microfibre loads in fishes collected on Protection Island, but we cannot account for the between-year variation. Nonetheless, the existence of such marked interannual variation indicates the importance of measuring year-to-year variation in microfibre pollution both at sea and in marine biota.},

  abstract = {Marine heatwaves (MHWs) have been observed around the world and are expected to increase in intensity and frequency under anthropogenic climate change. A variety of impacts have been associated with these anomalous events, including shifts in species ranges, local extinctions and economic impacts on seafood industries through declines in important fishery species and impacts on aquaculture. Extreme temperatures are increasingly seen as important influences on biological systems, yet a consistent definition of MHWs does not exist. A clear definition will facilitate retrospective comparisons between MHWs, enabling the synthesis and a mechanistic understanding of the role of MHWs in marine ecosystems. Building on research into atmospheric heatwaves, we propose both a general and specific definition for MHWs, based on a hierarchy of metrics that allow for different data sets to be used in identifying MHWs. We generally define a MHW as a prolonged discrete anomalously warm water event that can be described by its duration, intensity, rate of evolution, and spatial extent. Specifically, we consider an anomalously warm event to be a MHW if it lasts for five or more days, with temperatures warmer than the 90th percentile based on a 30-year historical baseline period. This structure provides flexibility with regard to the description of MHWs and transparency in communicating MHWs to a general audience. The use of these metrics is illustrated for three 21st century MHWs; the northern Mediterranean event in 2003, the Western Australia ‘Ningaloo Niño’ in 2011, and the northwest Atlantic event in 2012.

  abstract = {The world’s reliance on plastic is a contemporary dependence as its malleable function, low production cost, and increasing abundance has been universally favored over all other products. Created with the intention of short-term and one-time use, the global production of plastic reached 299 million tonnes in 2013, with 10-20 million tonnes ending up in the oceans annually. This study explores the contribution of microplastics to the marine environment from river systems, and quantifies the microplastic load within a stream as it passes from rural to urban environments. The sampled river is fed by a remote, glacially fed lake in the Cascadia Mountain Range, flowing into the upper Skykomish River, the Snohomish River, and eventually to the Puget Sound. Samples were collected by towing a 335 μm mesh manta trawl during an ebb tide and analyzed, after a wet peroxide oxidation and density separation, to quantify the concentration of microplastics present in the stream. From the 16 samples analyzed, a trend has been found between the quantity of plastics in the stream and the streams proximity to the headwaters. This trend implies that the growing quantity of microplastics within the stream, as it flows from rural to urban environments, is supplied through anthropogenic influences. This study has found 0.12 tonnes of microplastics are transported every year by this river system, equating to 1.2 x 109 pieces of microplastics. Following this study, microplastic pollution can no longer be thought of as a coastal and marine issue, but rather a problem that starts much further inland.},

  abstract = {Background: Reef corals are heterotrophic coelenterates that achieve high productivity through their photosynthetic dinoflagellate symbionts. Excessive seawater temperature destabilises this symbiosis and causes corals to ‘‘bleach,’’ lowering their photosynthetic capacity. Bleaching poses a serious threat to the persistence of coral reefs on a global scale. Despite expanding research on the causes of bleaching, the mechanisms remain a subject of debate. Methodology/Principal Findings: This study determined how light and food availability modulate the effects of temperature stress on photosynthesis in two reef coral species. We quantified the activities of Photosystem II, Photosystem I and whole chain electron transport under combinations of normal and stressful growth temperatures, moderate and high light levels and the presence or absence of feeding of the coral hosts. Our results show that PS1 function is comparatively robust against temperature stress in both species, whereas PS2 and whole chain electron transport are susceptible to temperature stress. In the symbiotic dinoflagellates of Stylophora pistillata the contents of chlorophyll and major photosynthetic complexes were primarily affected by food availability. In Turbinaria reniformis growth temperature was the dominant influence on the contents of the photosynthetic complexes. In both species feeding the host significantly protected photosynthetic function from high temperature stress. Conclusions/Significance: Our findings support the photoinhibition model of coral bleaching and demonstrate that PS1 is not a major site for thermal damage during bleaching events. Feeding mitigates bleaching in two scleractinian corals, so that reef responses to temperature stresses will likely be influenced by the coinciding availabilities of prey for the host.},

In the study region, Anthopleura elegantissima (Cnidaria; Anthozoa) hosts a single symbiont, the dinoflagellate Breviolum muscatinei. Salinity, temperature, and aerial stress induce a bleaching response similar to corals where symbionts are expelled, causing further energetic stress. Using field observations of environmental conditions and symbiont abundance at sites on a gradient of exposure to estuarine outflow, along with a fully crossed multifactorial lab experiment, we tested for changes in symbiont abundance in response to various combinations of three stressors. Lab experiments were designed to mimic short term outflow events with low salinity, high temperature, and aerial exposure treatments. The lab aerial exposure treatment was a statistically significant factor in suppressing symbiont repopulation (ANOVA, p = .017). In the field, symbiont density decreased with increasing tidal height at the site closest to freshwater outflow (ANOVA, p = .007), suggesting that aerial exposure may affect symbiont density more than sea surface temperature and salinity. Unanticipated documentation of survival in 9 months of sand burial and subsequent repopulation of symbionts is reported as a six-month extension to past observations, exemplifying strong tolerance to environmental insult in this Cnidarian mutualism. The study of this symbiosis is useful in examining predicted changes in ocean conditions in tidepool communities and considering relative sources of stress.},

  abstract = {Short-and long-duration light curves were applied to four macroalgae (Ulva sp., Codium fragile, Ecklonia radiata and Lessonia variegata), and two microalgal species (Chlorella emersonii and Chaetoceros muellerii). With increasing light curve duration, the maximal relative electron transport rate increased by a factor of three in E. radiata, and by factors of 1.25 and 1.23 in C. emersonii and L. variegata, respectively, but did not change in C. fragile and Ch. muellerii. The light saturation point Ek increased by 26 ␮mol photons m−2 s−1 in C. emersonii and 20 ␮mol photons m−2 s−1 in Ch. muellerii and E. radiata with elevated light curve exposure times. Oscillatory patterns of the continuous fluorescence readings reflect accumulation of QA. Continuous fluorescence values increased, or decreased, by approximately 10\% within light curve increments. However, oscillations of 25\% were not uncommon, which shows that cells are changing their photophysiological response state during steady light conditions. Increasing dark acclimation times prior to light curve application lowered maximal relative electron transport rates in the C. emersonii (from 28 ± 1.7 to 25 ± 1.2 for 15 and 95 min dark acclimation in short-duration light curves respectively). This effect was counterbalanced by longer light curve application. It can therefore be concluded that manipulation of light exposure and dark incubation prior to the experiment affects the photosynthetic response, presumably due to different activation states of photosynthetic and photoprotective mechanisms. The highly speciesspecific photo-response patterns imply that a common rapid light curve protocol will generate artefacts in some species.},

Moreover, the calculated BCFs of the long chain phthalates resulted up to three orders of magnitude lower than theoretically predicted (from logKow), whereas BCF of short chain phthalates resulted higher.

Population size and the quality of waste management systems largely determine which countries contribute the greatest mass of uncaptured waste available to become plastic marine debris.

  abstract = {There is currently much debate about the ecological advantages for reef corals of hosting multiple types of the symbiotic dinoflagellate Symbiodinium. Amongst these is their apparent capacity to tolerate higher than normal water temperatures. There is strong photokinetic evidence that the trait of heat-tolerance in plants is accompanied by energetic tradeoffs but little such evidence yet exists for corals. We use rapid light curves (RLCs) to investigate the photokinetic basis for thermo-tolerance in the reef coral Acropora millepora with symbionts of contrasting thermal tolerance for which there are measured differences in energetics. Our results show that under non-stressful temperatures, corals with heat-tolerant type D Symbiodinium had a 41\% lower maximum relative electron transport rate (rETRmax) and lower light absorption efficiency (α) due to lower cell Chl a content compared with corals with heat-sensitive type C2 symbionts. Our results provide support for a photokinetic link between heat tolerance and deficits in holobiont (coral + symbiont) growth, lipid stores and reproduction. Reduced electron transport rate and light absorption capacity may be genotype-specific attributes that enable clade D symbionts and their cnidarian hosts to cope with temperature stress but they inherently influence the photosynthetic function of the symbionts and thus have negative downstream effects on the coral.},

  abstract = {Plastids and mitochondria each arose from a single endosymbiotic event and share many similarities in how they were reduced and integrated with their host. However, the subsequent evolution of the two organelles could hardly be more different: mitochondria are a stable fixture of eukaryotic cells that are neither lost nor shuffled between lineages, whereas plastid evolution has been a complex mix of movement, loss and replacement. Molecular data from the past decade have substantially untangled this complex history, and we now know that plastids are derived from a single endosymbiotic event in the ancestor of glaucophytes, red algae and green algae (including plants). The plastids of both red algae and green algae were subsequently transferred to other lineages by secondary endosymbiosis. Green algal plastids were taken up by euglenids and chlorarachniophytes, as well as one small group of dinoflagellates. Red algae appear to have been taken up only once, giving rise to a diverse group called chromalveolates. Additional layers of complexity come from plastid loss, which has happened at least once and probably many times, and replacement. Plastid loss is difficult to prove, and cryptic, non-photosynthetic plastids are being found in many non-photosynthetic lineages. In other cases, photosynthetic lineages are now understood to have evolved from ancestors with a plastid of different origin, so an ancestral plastid has been replaced with a new one. Such replacement has taken place in several dinoflagellates (by tertiary endosymbiosis with other chromalveolates or serial secondary endosymbiosis with a green alga), and apparently also in two rhizarian lineages: chlorarachniophytes and               Paulinella               (which appear to have evolved from chromalveolate ancestors). The many twists and turns of plastid evolution each represent major evolutionary transitions, and each offers a glimpse into how genomes evolve and how cells integrate through gene transfers and protein trafficking.},

Overall, the responses of both “classical fluorescence parameters” and RLC endpoints were highly time dependent and related to the mode of action of the different compounds. Interestingly, parameters calculated from RLCs (α, ETRmax and Ik) were useful early markers of pesticide exposure since they revealed significant effects of all the tested toxicants from the first day of exposure. In comparison, classical fluorescence endpoints (F0 and Fv/Fm) measured at day 1 were only affected in the DCPMU treatment.

  abstract = {Carbonic anhydrases (CA; EC 4.2.1.1) play a vital role in dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) transport to photosynthetic microalgae residing in symbiotic cnidarians. The temperate sea anemone Anthopleura elegantissima can occur in three symbiotic states: hosting Breviolum muscatinei (brown), hosting Elliptochloris marina (green) or without algal symbionts (aposymbiotic). This provides a basis for A. elegantissima to be a model for detailed studies of the role of CA in DIC transport. This study investigated the effects of symbiosis, body size and light on CA activity and expression, and suggests that A. elegantissima has a heterotrophy-dominated trophic strategy. We identified putative A. elegantissima CA genes and performed phylogenetic analyses to infer subcellular localization in anemones. We performed experiments on field-collected anemones to compare: (1) CA activity and expression from anemones in different symbiotic states, (2) CA activity in brown anemones as a function of size, and (3) CA activity in anemones of different symbiotic states that were exposed to different light intensities. CA activity in brown anemones was highest, whereas activity in green and aposymbiotic anemones was low. Several CAs had expression patterns that mirrored activity, while another had expression that was inversely correlated with activity, suggesting that symbionts may induce different DIC transport pathways. Finally, CA activity was inversely correlated with anemone size.

  abstract = {In studies of both the establishment and breakdown of cnidarian-dinoflagellate symbiosis, it is often necessary to determine the number of Symbiodinium cells relative to the quantity of host tissue. Ideally, the methods used should be rapid, precise, and accurate. In this study, we systematically evaluated methods for sample preparation and storage and the counting of algal cells using the hemocytometer, a custom image-analysis program for automated counting of the fluorescent algal cells, the Coulter Counter, or the Millipore Guava flow-cytometer. We found that although other methods may have value in particular applications, for most purposes, the Guava flow cytometer provided by far the best combination of precision, accuracy, and efficient use of investigator time (due to the instrument's automated sample handling), while also allowing counts of algal numbers over a wide range and in small volumes of tissue homogenate. We also found that either of two assays of total homogenate protein provided a precise and seemingly accurate basis for normalization of algal counts to the total amount of holobiont tissue.},

Genetic differences within the symbiont populations of California anemones have been uncovered by restriction length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of the small subunit (SSU) and large subunit (LSU) ribosomal RNA genes, and by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of the internal transcribed spacer region 2 (ITS 2). The existence of two Symbiodinium species is substantiated by sequence analysis of the variable regions V1, V2, and V3 of the SSUrDNA, which also establishes their phylogenetic relatedness to other members of the genus Symbiodinium. Anemones from Washington and Oregon harbor a single dinoflagellate species, for which we propose the name S. muscatinei sp. nov. At these northern locations, S. muscatinei either exists alone or co-occurs with the Chlorella-like green algal symbiont. Our results indicate that S. muscatinei co-occurs with a second dinoflagellate, S. californium, in mixed populations in central and southern California. We suggest that the geographic distribution of these dinoflagellates is related to the temperature cline created by latitude.},

  abstract = {Global plastic production has increased exponentially since manufacturing commenced in the 1950’s, including polymer types infused with diverse additives and fillers. While the negative impacts of plastics are widely reported, particularly on marine vertebrates, impacts on microbial life remain poorly understood. Plastics impact microbiomes directly, exerting toxic effects, providing supplemental carbon sources and acting as rafts for microbial colonisation and dispersal. Indirect consequences include increased environmental shading, altered compositions of host communities and disruption of host organism or community health, hormone balances and immune responses. The isolation and application of plastic-degrading microbes are of substantial interest yet little evidence supports the microbial biodegradation of most high molecular weight synthetic polymers. Over 400 microbial species have been presumptively identified as capable of plastic degradation, but evidence for the degradation of highly prevalent polymers including polypropylene, nylon, polystyrene and polyvinyl chloride must be treated with caution; most studies fail to differentiate losses caused by the leaching or degradation of polymer monomers, additives or fillers. Even where polymer degradation is demonstrated, such as for polyethylene terephthalate, the ability of microorganisms to degrade more highly crystalline forms of the polymer used in commercial plastics appears limited. Microbiomes frequently work in conjunction with abiotic factors such as heat and light to impact the structural integrity of polymers and accessibility to enzymatic attack. Consequently, there remains much scope for extremophile microbiomes to be explored as a source of plastic-degrading enzymes and microorganisms. We propose a best-practice workflow for isolating and reporting plastic-degrading taxa from diverse environmental microbiomes, which should include multiple lines of evidence supporting changes in polymer structure, mass loss, and detection of presumed degradation products, along with confirmation of microbial strains and enzymes (and their associated genes) responsible for high molecular weight plastic polymer degradation. Such approaches are necessary for enzymatic degraders of high molecular weight plastic polymers to be differentiated from organisms only capable of degrading the more labile carbon within predominantly amorphous plastics, plastic monomers, additives or fillers.},

  abstract = {Microplastic pollution is a major threat to the marine environment attracting attention from scientific and public communities. Although we have sufficient evidence that microplastic is ubiquitous in all ecosystems, the ques­ tion of the harmfulness of microplastic exposure is still under debate. Filter feeders like bivalves are commonly exposed to microplastics in water and sediments and thus can serve as excellent biological indicators for microplastic pollution. A relatively rich toxicological literature has been focusing on microplastic effects on bivalves but we have yet to reach an agreement on the toxic effects and mechanisms of microplastics. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis and bibliometrics analysis of the microplastic studies in bivalves. The bibliometric analysis (used to evaluate the general research trends) showed that the investigation of microplastic distribution in the marine environment and the molecular mechanisms of microplastic toxicity are the two major hot spots of research. Based on analyses of ecologically and environmentally relevant microplastics concentrations, particle sizes and polymer types, we discuss the physiological effects of microplastics on bivalves, and the severity and direction of the effects at the cellular, tissue, organ and organismal levels. The meta-analysis results show that microplastics can induce time-dependent oxidative stress in bivalves. Generally, the activities of antioxidant enzymes, such as glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) increased during short-term exposure but declined after long-term exposure to microplastics. Non-linear response of GPx, GST and SOD enzymes to MP exposure over time indicate that these enzymes are not good biomarkers of MPs effects in marine bivalves. The tissue glutathione levels and catalase (CAT activity) showed an increase during both short- and long term MP exposures and thus can be used as oxidative stress biomarkers of sublethal MPs effects in marine bivalves.},

Despite these efforts, our understanding of how essential genes function to facilitate symbiosis establishment and maintenance remains limited. The inclusion of taxonomically and ecologically diverse endosymbionts will enhance our understanding of these interactions. Here we characterize the transcriptomes of two very different symbionts found within the temperate sea anemone Anthopleura elegantissima: the chlorophyte Elliptochloris marina and the dinoflagellate Symbiodinium muscatinei. We use a multi-level approach to assess the diversity of genes found across S. muscatinei and E. marina transcriptomes, and compare their overall protein domains with other dinoflagellates and chlorophytes. Our analysis identified several genes that are potentially involved in mitigating stress response (e.g., heat shock proteins pathways for mediating reactive oxygen species) and metabolic exchange (e.g., ion transporters). Finally, we show that S. muscatinei and other Symbiodinium strains are equipped with a high salt peridinin-chl-protein (HSPCP) gene previously identified only in free-living dinoflagellates. The addition of these transcriptomes to the cnidarian-symbiont molecular toolkit will aid in understanding how these vitally important symbiotic relationships are established and maintained across a variety of environmental conditions.},

Microplastic  concentrations are determined in Hood Canal and Whidbey Basin in Puget  Sound, WA during December 2016. Eight stations were sampled using a 335 μm  Manta Net towed from the R/V Barnes, then sieving water samples through a  0.33mm mesh sieve. Remaining products were then rid of organics, placed in a  density separator, dried, and extracted for microplastics. By comparing  microplastic concentration to basin residence times and population density, the  main contributor to microplastic accumulation can be determined. Residence  time (determined by wind and circulation) is a more important indicator to  where plastics will distribute in Puget Sound. Microplastic concentration ranges  from 0.069 pieces/m3 in Whidbey Basin to 0.36 pieces/m3 in southern Hood  Canal. The mass of microplastics at each station was strongly attributed to the  amount of Styrofoam present. This study acts as a baseline study for Puget Sound  estuary and could help serve to understand where pollutant cleanups could be  effective.},

Both, naturally occurring symbiotic and symbiont-free (aposymbiotic) anemones were used in this study to investigate differences in metal uptake due to the symbiotic state of the animal. The effects of metal exposures on the anemone-algal symbiosis were determined using measures of algal cell density and mitotic index (MI). Anemones were exposed to either cadmium, copper, nickel or zinc chloride (0, 10, 100 μg l−1 for Cd, Cu and Ni; 0, 100, 1000 μg l−1 for Zn) for 42 days followed by a 42-day recovery period in ambient seawater. Anemones were analyzed for metal content using inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) at various time points during the study. Symbiotic anemones accumulated Cd, Ni and Zn to a greater extent than aposymbiotic anemones. A dramatically different pattern of Cu accumulation was observed, with aposymbiotic anemones accumulating higher levels than symbiotic anemones. Following recovery in ambient seawater, all tissue metal levels were reduced to near pre-exposure control levels in most cases. No changes in algal cell density or MI were observed in symbiotic anemone tentacle clips at any dose or time point in the Cd and Cu exposures. However, significant reductions in algal cell densities were observed in the Ni-exposed and some Zn-exposed animals, although levels returned to control values following recovery. There were no changes in mitotic index (MI) following Ni or Zn exposures. These results demonstrate that the extent of heavy metal accumulation depends upon cnidarian symbiotic state and the heavy metal in question.},

This paper investigates the responses to laboratory cadmium exposures in the North American Pacific coast temperate sea anemone Anthopleura elegantissima. Anemones were exposed to cadmium chloride (control, 20 and 100 μg l−1 Cd) for 14 days (sampled at days 0, 2, 7 and 14) and analyzed for Cd content using inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS). Higher levels of Cd were demonstrated in symbiotic anemones compared to symbiont-free (aposymbiotic) anemones (e.g. 100 μg l−1 Cd exposure at day 14; 12.4±2.4 and 4.5±1.9 ng Cd mg−1 dry weight, respectively; t-test; p{$<$}0.001). These higher levels in symbiotic anemones were not due to increasing uptake of Cd by the algal symbionts (levels in algal-containing pellet fractions were constant over dose and time; t-test; p{$>$}0.05) but rather to increased accumulation by both partners. No changes in algal cell density were observed in symbiotic anemone tentacle clips at any dose or time point (ANOVA; p{$>$}0.05). Changes in glutathione (GSH) levels have been proposed as a useful biomarker in other marine invertebrates in response to heavy metal stress, but GSH studies have not been reported for this species. We demonstrate the presence of GSH in A. elegantissima and its depletion (58.2\% of control values) following 1-week exposure to buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), a nontoxic chemical known to deplete GSH. Levels of GSH were higher in symbiotic compared to aposymbiotic anemones (control averages, 563±81 and 485±58 nmol GSH mg−1 wet weight, respectively; t-test; p{$<$}0.001). Following Cd exposure, significant reductions (t-test; p{$<$}0.05) in GSH levels were observed only in the aposymbiotic anemones (exposure to 100 μg l−1 Cd resulted in a 27\% reduction from control levels at day 14). Our results demonstrate that the accumulation of Cd depends upon symbiotic state and provides the first identification of a GSH response in anemones and indeed in any cnidarian in response to heavy metals.},

Anemones were exposed to either cadmium, copper, nickel or zinc chloride (0, 10, 100 microg l(-1) for Cd, Cu and Ni; 0, 100, 1000 microg l(-1) for Zn) for 42 days followed by a 42-day recovery period in ambient seawater. Anemones were analyzed for metal content using inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) at various time points during the study. Symbiotic anemones accumulated Cd, Ni and Zn to a greater extent than aposymbiotic anemones. A dramatically different pattern of Cu accumulation was observed, with aposymbiotic anemones accumulating higher levels than symbiotic anemones. Following recovery in ambient seawater, all tissue metal levels were reduced to near pre-exposure control levels in most cases. No changes in algal cell density or MI were observed in symbiotic anemone tentacle clips at any dose or time point in the Cd and Cu exposures. However, significant reductions in algal cell densities were observed in the Ni-exposed and some Zn-exposed animals, although levels returned to control values following recovery. There were no changes in mitotic index (MI) following Ni or Zn exposures. These results demonstrate that the extent of heavy metal accumulation depends upon cnidarian symbiotic state and the heavy metal in question.},

  abstract = {Coastal ecosystems are increasingly impacted by anthropogenic activities and contaminant inputs, including heavy metals. This paper investigates the responses to laboratory cadmium exposures in the North American Pacific coast temperate sea anemone Anthopleura elegantissima. Anemones were exposed to cadmium chloride (control, 20 and 100 μg l−1 Cd) for 14 days (sampled at days 0, 2, 7 and 14) and analyzed for Cd content using inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS). Higher levels of Cd were demonstrated in symbiotic anemones compared to symbiont-free (aposymbiotic) anemones (e.g. 100 μg l−1 Cd exposure at day 14; 12.4±2.4 and 4.5±1.9 ng Cd mg−1 dry weight, respectively; t-test; p{$<$}0.001). These higher levels in symbiotic anemones were not due to increasing uptake of Cd by the algal symbionts (levels in algal-containing pellet fractions were constant over dose and time; t-test; p{$>$}0.05) but rather to increased accumulation by both partners. No changes in algal cell density were observed in symbiotic anemone tentacle clips at any dose or time point (ANOVA; p{$>$}0.05). Changes in glutathione (GSH) levels have been proposed as a useful biomarker in other marine invertebrates in response to heavy metal stress, but GSH studies have not been reported for this species. We demonstrate the presence of GSH in A. elegantissima and its depletion (58.2\% of control values) following 1-week exposure to buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), a nontoxic chemical known to deplete GSH. Levels of GSH were higher in symbiotic compared to aposymbiotic anemones (control averages, 563±81 and 485±58 nmol GSH mg−1 wet weight, respectively; t-test; p{$<$}0.001). Following Cd exposure, significant reductions (t-test; p{$<$}0.05) in GSH levels were observed only in the aposymbiotic anemones (exposure to 100 μg l−1 Cd resulted in a 27\% reduction from control levels at day 14). Our results demonstrate that the accumulation of Cd depends upon symbiotic state and provides the first identification of a GSH response in anemones and indeed in any cnidarian in response to heavy metals.},

Although microplastics threaten marine ecosystems in various ways, little is known about  their sink, vertical distribution or role in estuaries. To address the lack of knowledge of the  vertical distribution of microplastics in estuarine systems, this study collects and analyzes  observational data across the water column in Puget Sound using a series of net tows.  Microplastics were visually observed in all samples collected and the samples were quantified to  concentrations at each depth. The highest microplastic concentration - 1.88x10 -4 g/m 3 - was  found in Possession Sound while the most consistent vertical profile was found at Seabeck in  Hood Canal, suggesting residence time is more likely a driving factor to vertical distribution than  proximity to population centers. This study uses a novel approach to researching the vertical  distribution of microplastics and therefore highlights the need for further research and awareness  on the increasingly important issue of microplastics.},

  abstract = {The sea anemone Anthopleura elegantissima (Brandt) hosts two species of symbiotic dinoflagellates, known as zooxanthellae, which coexist within the host at southern latitudes only. One of these species, Symbiodinium muscatinei LaJeunesse et Trench, has a broad latitudinal distribution, occurring in intertidal anemones from Washington state to Southern California. To investigate whether high thermal tolerance contributes to the ability of S. muscatinei to inhabit anemones from northern and southern regions, the upper thermal tolerance limit for photosynthesis of symbionts in northern (48°24′ N) populations of A. elegantissima was determined by subjecting anemones to a gradual increase in temperature from 12°C to 30°C over a 10-week period. Light-saturated photosynthetic rates of isolated zooxanthellae were the same over the range of 12°C–24°C and declined significantly at 26°C, which is 14°C and 5°C above average summertime seawater temperatures in northern Puget Sound and Southern California, respectively. At 28°C, zooxanthellae isolated from the anemones, and those expelled by their hosts, exhibited extremely low rates of photosynthesis and highly reduced chl content. The photosynthetic rates and chl content of expelled zooxanthellae were lower than those of retained zooxanthellae. The high thermal tolerance of S. muscatinei isolated from northern populations of anemones supports the broad latitudinal distribution of this symbiont, allowing it to coexist with S. californium (\#383, Banaszak et al. 1993) in southern populations of anemones.},

  abstract = {Chlorophyll fluorescence is a non-invasive measurement of photosystem II (PSII) activity and is a commonly used technique in plant physiology. The sensitivity of PSII activity to abiotic and biotic factors has made this a key technique not only for understanding the photosynthetic mechanisms but also as a broader indicator of how plants respond to environmental change. This, along with low cost and ease of collecting data, has resulted in the appearance of a large array of instrument types for measurement and calculated parameters which can be bewildering for the new user. Moreover, its accessibility can lead to misuse and misinterpretation when the underlying photosynthetic processes are not fully appreciated. This review is timely because it sits at a point of renewed interest in chlorophyll fluorescence where fast measurements of photosynthetic performance are now required for crop improvement purposes. Here we help the researcher make choices in terms of protocols using the equipment and expertise available, especially for field measurements. We start with a basic overview of the principles of fluorescence analysis and provide advice on best practice for taking pulse amplitude-modulated measurements. We also discuss a number of emerging techniques for contemporary crop and ecology research, where we see continual development and application of analytical techniques to meet the new challenges that have arisen in recent years. We end the review by briefly discussing the emerging area of monitoring fluorescence, chlorophyll fluorescence imaging, field phenotyping, and remote sensing of crops for yield and biomass enhancement.},

  abstract = {ALONG THE PACIFIC COAST of North America sea anemones of the genus Antbopleura are dominant intertidal coelenterates. They occur as so\textasciitilde itary tide pool inhabitants (A . xanthogrammica) or as aggregations carpeting firm substrates (A. elegantissima). One of the unique features of these species is their invariable symbiotic association with unicellular Dinophyceae. These brown or yellow-brown algae, known as zooxanthellae, occur intracellularly in the gastrodermal tissues of the host anemone (Muscatine, 1961) . ' The influence of these symbiotic algae on the biology of Antbopleur« and on other anemones has been studied experimentally. The algae fix 14C02 and manufacture reduced organic carbon. Some of this carbon is translocated to the host anemone tissue where it is used in the synthesis of a wide range of animal constituents. In the absence of these algae, starved anemones lose weight faster than controls with algae. Thus, the adaptive value of the algae seems, in part, to be nutritional (Muscatine and Hand, 1958; Muscatine, 1961; Trench, 1968, 1969; Taylor, 1968, 1969). Within the past several years there have been unpublished reports concerning the occurrence of a green alga symbiotic with Antbopleur« from the American Pacific coast. Since the natural coexistence of more than one species of symbiotic algae in a given host is rare, it seemed to be of interest to investigate this phenomenon. This study describes an attempt to define the symbiotic status of the green symbionts in Antbopleura, using criteria from known symbiotic associations involving zooxanthellae and sea anemones. No attempt is made here to delve into the e:ology of the associations. A precise description of the green symbiont awaits the work of a competent phycologist.},

Yet, there are few large-scale studies systematically exploring the appropriateness of using these tools interchangeably, and the scale and significance of the differences between them. Here, we compare the performance of 14 differential abundance testing methods on 38 16S rRNA gene datasets with two sample groups. We test for differences in amplicon sequence variants and operational taxonomic units (ASVs) between these groups. Our findings confirm that these tools identified drastically different numbers and sets of significant ASVs, and that results depend on data pre-processing. For many tools the number of features identified correlate with aspects of the data, such as sample size, sequencing depth, and effect size of community differences. ALDEx2 and ANCOM-II produce the most consistent results across studies and agree best with the intersect of results from different approaches. Nevertheless, we recommend that researchers should use a consensus approach based on multiple differential abundance methods to help ensure robust biological interpretations.},

Moreover, species interactions or the presence of multiple stressors can modify the stressor effects, yet most work focuses on single stressors and single species. Plant-microbe interactions are a class of species interactions on which ecosystems and agricultural systems depend, yet may be affected by multiple global change stressors. Here, we use duckweed and microbes from its microbiome to model responses of interacting plants and microbes to multiple stressors: climate change and tire wear particles. Climate change is occurring globally, and microplastic tire wear particles from roads now reach many ecosystems. We paired perpendicular gradients of temperature and carbon dioxide (CO2) treatments with factorial manipulation of leachate from tire wear particles and duckweed microbiomes. We found that tire leachate and warmer temperatures enhanced duckweed and microbial growth, but caused effects of microbes on duckweed to become negative. However, induced negative effects of microbes were less than additive with warming and leachate. Without tire leachate, we observed that higher CO2 and temperature induced positive correlations between duckweed and microbial growth, which can strengthen mutualisms. In contrast, with tire leachate, growth correlations were never positive, and shifted negative at lower CO2, again suggesting leachate disrupts this plant-microbiome mutualism. In summary, our results demonstrate that multiple interacting stressors can affect multiple interacting species, and that leachate from tire wear particles could potentially disrupt plant-microbe mutualisms.},

The resulting accumulation of small plastic detritus less than 5 mm in size, termed "microplastics", has started threatening the life cycles of marine organisms. Here we show the first evidence that microplastics disturb the initiation of symbiotic relationships in anthozoan-algae symbiosis. We found in both the aposymbiotic sea-anemone Aiptasia sp. and the coral Favites chinensis that the infectivity of symbiotic algae into the host is severely suppressed by microspheres fed either directly or indirectly through microsphere-fed Anemia sp. Similar trends were seen when microplastics collected from commercial facewash were used instead of microspheres. Therefore, ongoing accumulation of microplastics in the ocean might disturb the healthy anthozoan-algae symbiotic relationships, which are cornerstones of the biologically enriched coral reef ecosystem.},

In addition, microplastics disturb the formation of coral-algae symbiotic relationships in primary polyps. In our experiments, we observed this effect in the bleached primary polyp Seriatopora caliendrum that lost its symbiont Symbiodiniaceae as a result of high water temperature. There was a higher incorporation of microspheres into bleached corals than in healthy ones. To understand the interference in symbiosis, we used the sea anemone Exaiptasia (as an anthozoan model organism) and fed it with microspheres. TEM results suggested the incorporation of microspheres and symbionts from the same phagocytosis zones in the mesenterial filament and endocytosis by the cells. In the tentacles, microspheres were in the same cell layer as the symbionts. These results suggest that microplastics occupy the spaces inhabited by Symbiodiniaceae, thereby hindering their symbiotic association.},

  abstract = {Phthalic Acid Esters (PAEs) are a group of emerging organic contaminants that have become a serious issue because of their ubiquitous presence and hazardous impact on the marine environment worldwide. Seawater samples were collected monthly from December 2013 to November 2014 in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea (Marseille Bay). The samples were analyzed for dissolved organic carbon (DOC) as well as the molecular distribution of dissolved PAEs by using solid phase extraction followed by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analyses. The results demonstrated the occurrence of six PAEs, including dimethyl phthalate (DMP), diethyl phthalate (DEP), di-isobutyl phthalate (DiBP), di-n-butyl phthalate (DnBP), benzylbutyl phthalate (BzBP) and diethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), with total concentrations ranging from 130 to 1330ngL−1 (av. 522ngL−1). In Marseille Bay, the highest concentrations were detected in the bottom water from June to November 2014 and in the whole water column during the winter mixing period. This result suggests that resuspension of PAE-rich sediment, in relation to the accumulation of plastic debris above the seabed, or the higher degradation rate in the upper layer of the water column, plays a significant role in the PAE dynamics in coastal water. DEHP was the most abundant PAE in all of the surface samples and the summer bottom samples, followed by DiBP and DnBP, which also represent the largest fractions in the other bottom samples.},

Renaturation processes in the Baltic Sea include removal of coastal protection measures thereby facilitating exchange processes between peatland and Baltic Sea water masses with inhabiting aquatic organisms, which suddenly face new environmental conditions. In this study, two Baltic Sea and three peatland benthic diatom strains were investigated for their ecophysiological response patterns as a function of numerous growth media, light, and temperature conditions. Results clearly showed growth stimulation for all five diatom strains when cultivated in peatland water-based media, with growth dependency on salinity for the Baltic Sea diatom isolates. Nutrient availability in the peatland water resulted in higher growth rates, and growth was further stimulated by the carbon-rich peatland water probably facilitating heterotrophic growth in Melosira nummuloides and two Planothidium sp. isolates. Photosynthesis parameters for all five diatom strains indicated low light requirements with light saturated photosynthesis at {$<$}70 µmol photons m−2 s−1 in combination with only minor photoinhibition as well as eurythermal traits with slightly higher temperature width for the peatland strains. Growth media composition did not affect photosynthetic rates.},

  abstract = {Warming and nutrient limitation are stressors known to weaken the health of microalgae. In situations of stress, access to energy reserves can minimize physiological damage. Because of its widespread requirements in biochemical processes, iron is an important trace metal, especially for photosynthetic organisms. Lowered iron availability in oceans experiencing rising temperatures may contribute to the thermal sensitivity of reef-building corals, which rely on mutualisms with dinoflagellates to survive. To test the influence of iron concentration on thermal sensitivity, the physiological responses of cultured symbiotic dinoflagellates (genus Breviolum; family Symbiodiniaceae) were evaluated when exposed to increasing temperatures (26 to 30°C) and iron concentrations ranging from replete (500 pM Fe’) to limiting (50 pM Fe’) under a diurnal light cycle with saturating radiance. Declines in photosynthetic efficiency at elevated temperatures indicated sensitivity to heat stress. Furthermore, five times the amount of iron was needed to reach exponential growth during heat stress (50 pM Fe′ at 26–28°C vs. 250 pM Fe′ at 30°C). In treatments where exponential growth was reached, Breviolum psygmophilum grew faster than B.minutum, possibly due to greater cellular contents of iron and other trace metals. The metal composition of B.psygmophilum shifted only at the highest temperature (30°C), whereas changes in B.minutum were observed at lower temperatures (28°C). The influence of iron availability in modulating each alga’s response to thermal stress suggests the importance of trace metals to the health of coral-algal mutualisms. Ultimately, a greater ability to acquire scarce metals may improve the tolerance of corals to physiological stressors and contribute to the differences in performance associated with hosting one symbiont species over another.},

  abstract = {Cnidarians in symbiosis with photosynthetic protists must withstand daily hyperoxic/anoxic transitions within their host cells. Comparative studies between symbiotic (Anemonia viridis) and non-symbiotic (Actinia schmidti) sea anemones show striking differences in their response to oxidative stress. First, the basal expression of SOD is very different. Symbiotic animal cells have a higher isoform diversity (number and classes) and a higher activity than the non-symbiotic cells. Second, the symbiotic animal cells of A. viridis also maintain unaltered basal values for cellular damage when exposed to experimental hyperoxia (100\% O(2)) or to experimental thermal stress (elevated temperature +7 degrees C above ambient). Under such conditions, A. schmidti modifies its SOD activity significantly. Electrophoretic patterns diversify, global activities diminish and cell damage biomarkers increase. These data suggest symbiotic cells adapt to stress while non-symbiotic cells remain acutely sensitive. In addition to being toxic, high O(2) partial pressure (P(O(2))) may also constitute a preconditioning step for symbiotic animal cells, leading to an adaptation to the hyperoxic condition and, thus, to oxidative stress. Furthermore, in aposymbiotic animal cells of A. viridis, repression of some animal SOD isoforms is observed. Meanwhile, in cultured symbionts, new activity bands are induced, suggesting that the host might protect its zooxanthellae in hospite. Similar results have been observed in other symbiotic organisms, such as the sea anemone Aiptasia pulchella and the scleractinian coral Stylophora pistillata. Molecular or physical interactions between the two symbiotic partners may explain such variations in SOD activity and might confer oxidative stress tolerance to the animal host.},

Small plastic particles in the microscale and nanoscale ranges have been found in all marine ecosystems, but little is known about their effects upon marine organisms. In this study, we examine changes in cell growth, aggregation, and gene expression of two symbiotic dinoflagellates of the family Symbiodiniaceae, Symbiodinium tridacnidorum (clade A3), and Cladocopium sp. (clade C) under exposure to 42-nm polystyrene beads. In laboratory experiments, the cell number and aggregation were reduced after 10 days of nanoplastic exposure at 0.01, 0.1, and 10 mg/L concentrations, but no clear correlation with plastic concentration was observed. Genes involved in dynein motor function were upregulated when compared to control conditions, while genes related to photosynthesis, mitosis, and intracellular degradation were downregulated. Overall, nanoplastic exposure led to more genes being downregulated than upregulated and the number of genes with altered expression was larger in Cladocopium sp. than in S. tridacnidorum, suggesting different sensitivity to nano-plastics between species. Our data show that nano-plastic inhibits growth and alters aggregation properties of microalgae, which may negatively affect the uptake of these indispensable symbionts by coral reef organisms.},

The presence of phaeophytin (Ph) a not only interferes with estimates of Chl a but also with Chl b and c determinations. The universal algorithms can hence be misleading if used on natural collections containing large amounts of Ph. The methanol algorithms are severely affected by the presence of Ph and so are not recommended. The algorithms were tested on representative mixtures of Chls prepared from extracts of algae with known Chl composition. The limits of detection (and inherent error, ±95 \% confidence limit) for all the Chl equations were less than 0.03 g m−3. The algorithms are both accurate and precise for Chl a and d but less accurate for Chl b and c. With caution the algorithms can be used to calculate a Chl profile of natural assemblages of algae. The relative error of measurements of Chls increases hyperbolically in diluted extracts. For safety reasons, efficient extraction of Chls and the convenience of being able to use polystyrene cuvettes, the algorithms for ethanol are recommended for routine assays of Chls in natural assemblages of aquatic plants.},

DMSO solvent offers the advantages of low volatility, low toxicity, low flammability, biodegradability, and ease of transport and is an effective extractant of chlorophylls.

  abstract = {Approximately 5.25 trillion plastic pieces are floating at the sea surface. The impact of plastic pollution on the lowest trophic levels of the food web, however, remains unknown. Here we show that plastics release dissolved organic carbon (DOC) into the ambient seawater stimulating the activity of heterotrophic microbes. Our estimates indicate that globally up to 23,600 metric tons of DOC are leaching from marine plastics annually. About 60\% of it is available to microbial utilization in less than 5 days. If exposed to solar radiation, however, this DOC becomes less labile. Thus, plastic pollution of marine surface waters likely alters the composition and activity of the base of the marine food webs. It is predicted that plastic waste entering the ocean will increase by a factor of ten within the next decade, resulting in an increase in plastic-derived DOC that might have unaccounted consequences for marine microbes and for the ocean system.},

The intertidal forms an environmental gradient where stress increases with tidal height. Here, we explore the contribution of fixed genotypic and plastic environmental effects on thermal tolerance of the intertidal anemone Anthopleura elegantissima and its algal symbionts using a laboratory-based tank experiment. High intertidal anemones had lower baseline symbiont-to-host cell ratios under control conditions, but their symbionts had higher baseline maximum quantum yield compared to low intertidal anemone symbionts, despite identical symbiont communities. High intertidal anemones maintained greater maximum quantum yield and symbiont-to-host cell ratios under heat stress compared to low intertidal anemones, suggesting that high intertidal holobionts have greater thermal tolerance. However, thermal tolerance of clonal anemones acclimatized to different zones was not explained by tidal height alone, indicating emersion duration is not the sole environmental driver of physiological variation. Fixed genotypic effects also influenced physiological baselines, but did not modulate thermal tolerance, demonstrating thermal tolerance is largely driven by environmental history. These results indicate that this symbiosis is highly plastic and may be able to rapidly acclimatize to climate change, defying the convention that symbiotic organisms are more susceptible to environmental stress.},

Anemones contained zooxanthellae (brown anemones), zoochlorellae (green anemones), or a mixture of both algae (mixed anemones). Temperature and light have different effects on zooxanthellae and zoochlorellae, resulting in changes in the algal complement of A. elqpntissima. High temperature caused a significant decrease in the density of zoochlorellae over 25 days (in green anemones: - 32 and - 20 algae/p,g tentacle protein per day under HL and LL, respectively) and a reduction in algal mitotic index (from 15\% to {$<$} 5\% cells dividing after 6 days). Low light caused a significant increase in the density of zooxanthellae over 25 days (in brown anemones: + I.5 and + 20 algae/pg tentacle protein per day at 13°C and 2O”C, respectively). Overall, temperature had a greater effect than light on the population density of algae in the tentacles of A. elegantissima; the percent change in zoochlorellae density in tentacles of anemones held at 20°C was significantly less (in green anemones, - 69\%) than changes obtained with all other symbiont-temperature interactions. Zooxanthellae and zoochlorellae in mixed anemone tentacles showed the same population density response to the treatments as zooxanthellae and zoochlorellae in brown and green anemones, respectively. Population densities of both algal symbionts are regulated by temperature and light, and the relative abundance of each alga in a host anemone may be shifted with changes in these environmental factors. 0 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.},

Plastic gear is necessary for the viability of many of these operations. During the past few years, shellfish farm permits issued in Washington State have been challenged on various bases that have included allegations that the plastic gear is releasing microplastics, commonly defined as particles less than 5 mm in diameter. Published survey data on sources of marine plastic debris demonstrate the very limited contribution of aquaculture gear. Both permits and industry codes of practice provide procedures to minimize loss of gear to the marine environment. Plastic gear is also designed specifically to maintain its integrity and not degrade in the marine environment. Plastic degradation is greatest on beaches with high UV exposure, whereas aquaculture gear is mostly underwater and/or covered by biofoulants. Available data for microplastics in water, sediment, and biota of the Salish Sea do not suggest significant release of microplastics from shellfish aquaculture operations.

The fission process leaves a noticeable scar which develops body—wall adhesive verrucae and returns to normal appearance over a month or more. The incidence of new division scars (without verrucae) and that of old scars (with developing verrucae) were used to examine the seasonality of the division process at Cattle Point, San Juan Island, Washington State, USA. Divisions can occur at any time of year but are most frequent during August to February. Body size increased over the spring and summer (April—August) and decreased over the fall and winter (September—March) in population samples and in monitored experimental clones. Frequency of division was positively correlated with a seasonal decrease of anemone basal diameter in the field. Division was least common during the period of rapid individual growth in the spring and early summer. When compared at the annual peak of body size it was the larger individuals that went on to divide over the fall and winter. Agonistic interactions (acrorhagial response, Francis 1973b) were used to examine the spatial extent of clonal aggregations at three field sites. Single clones were often discontinuous and were distributed over areas up to 100 m2. Clone size increased from exposed to protected locations and from exposed (convex) to protected (concave) microhabitat.},

  abstract = {Continually immersed specimens of Anthop!eura e!egantissima freshly collected from the shore receive at least 34â€”42\%of their respiratory carbon requirement from their endosymbiotic zooxanthellae. This value decreases to 17\% when intertidal sea anemones are exposed to air for 15 h during daytime spring low tides, primarily owing to a reduction in photosynthesis by the algae, which are shaded when the anemone retracts its tentacles and contracts its marginal sphincter. Contraction of continually immersed anemones during peak irradiance likewise decreases their pho tosynthesis. This behavior is primarily in response to high levels of intracellular oxygen generated by the symbiotic algae, although ultraviolet radiation also causes contraction, especially in aposymbiotic individuals which have lower concentrations ofUV-B absorbing substances than do symbiotic anemones. Although A. e!egantissima may vary its photosynthetic capacity according to long-term average light conditions, behavioral adaptations such as contraction and attachment of debris to the column verrucae protect the animal and its algal symbionts from deleterious photodynamic effects during short-term exposure to peak levels of irradiance.},

  abstract = {Both the physiology and distribution of intertidal organisms are strongly influenced by different kinds of physical stress. Temperature, UV radiation and desiccation in low tide conditions are usually considered the most important physical stresses. These factors impact cell metabolism, and the organism's ability to rapidly adapt to altering environmental conditions sets its tidal distribution limits. The role of the HSP70 protein (stress protein) family in thermal stress responses has been widely demonstrated. Although it has been shown that stress protein expression is a useful tool to quantify part of this physical stress, few studies have been made with different in situ intertidal organisms. To test differences in HSP70 expression under natural conditions in the intertidal environment, we chose a common cnidarian of the eastern Pacific Ocean: the anemone Anthopleura elegantissima. Polyp HSP70 expression depends on the degree of emersion and the extent of physical stress (0.1-3.6 ± 1.5 ng HSP70 μg Protein-1 were registered between fully immersed and fully emersed polyps of the same clone). The time of immersion is reflected in the recovery of polyp HSP70 levels from the high tidal exposure (reaching again as shallower clones express more HSP70 (2.5 ng HSP70 μg P-1), than deeper ones (0.1 ng HSP70 μg P-1). Also sunny and foggy environmental situations influence the stress response. Anemone clones exposed to the sunny high intertidal zone express more than three times HSP70 (2.2 ng HSP70 μg P-1) than those on a foggy high intertidal day (0.6 ng HSP70 μg P-1). For A. elegantissima, shrinking of Polyps, mucus secretion, sand covering, UV absorbing molecules, and a tight patch structure work concurrently with HSP70 expression to alleviate the effects of physical stress in low tidal emersion.},

  abstract = {Ocean warming driven bleaching is one of the greatest threats to zooxanthellate cnidarians in the Anthropocene. Bleaching is the loss of Symbiodiniaceae, chlorophyll, or both from zooxanthellate animals. To quantify bleaching and recovery, standardised methods for quantification of Symbiodiniaceae and chlorophyll concentrations have been developed for reef-building scleractinian corals, but no such standard method has been developed for octocorals. For stony corals, quantification of Symbiodiniaceae and chlorophyll concentrations often relies on normalisation to skeletal surface area or unit of biomass (i.e. protein, ash-free dry weight (AFDW)). Stiff octocorals do not change their volume, as such studies have used volume and surface area to standardise densities, but soft-bodied octocorals can alter their size using water movement within the animal; therefore, Symbiodiniaceae and chlorophyll cannot accurately be measured per unit of surface area and are instead measured in units of Symbiodiniaceae and chlorophyll per µg of host protein or AFDW. Though AFDW is more representative of the full biomass composition than host protein, AFDW is more time and resource intensive. Here we provide a streamlined methodology to quantify Symbiodiniaceae density, chlorophyll concentration, and protein content in soft-bodied octocorals. This technique uses minimal equipment, does not require freeze-drying or burning samples to obtain ash weight, and is effective for down to 0.2 grams wet tissue. Bulk samples can be centrifuged, the Symbiodiniaceae pellet washed, and the supernatant saved for protein analysis. This efficient technique allows for clean, easy to count samples of Symbiodiniaceae with minimal animal protein contamination. Chlorophyll a and c2 extractions occurs at different rates, with chlorophyll a taking 24 hours to extract completely at 4°C and chlorophyll c2 taking 48 hours. Finally, we found that where necessary, wet weight may be used as a proxy for protein content, but the correlation of protein and wet weight varies by species and protein should be used when possible. Overall, we have created a rapid and accurate method for quantification of bleaching markers in octocorals.},

  abstract = {Microplastics are widespread emerging marine pollutants that have been found in the coral reef ecosystem. In the present study, using Cladocopium goreaui as a symbiont representative, we investigated cytological, physiological, and molecular responses of a Symbiodiniaceae species to weeklong microplastic exposure (Polystyrene, diameter 1.0~μm, 9.0~×~109 particles L-1). The density and size of algal cells decreased significantly at 7~d and 6-7~d of microplastic exposure, respectively. Chlorophyll a content increased significantly at 7~d of exposure, whereas Fv/Fm did not change significantly during the entire exposure period. We observed significant increases in superoxide dismutase activity and caspase3 activation level, significant decrease in glutathione S-transferase activity, but no change in catalase activity during the whole exposure period. Transcriptomic analysis revealed 191 significantly upregulated and 71 significantly downregulated genes at 7~d after microplastic exposure. Fifteen GO terms were overrepresented for these significantly upregulated genes, which were grouped into four categories including transmembrane ion transport, substrate-specific transmembrane transporter activity, calcium ion binding, and calcium-dependent cysteine-type endopeptidase activity. Thirteen of the significantly upregulated genes encode metal ion transporter and ammonium transporter, and five light-harvesting protein genes were among the significantly downregulated genes. These results demonstrate that microplastics can act as an exogenous stressor, suppress detoxification activity, nutrient uptake, and photosynthesis, elevate oxidative stress, and raise the apoptosis level through upregulating ion transport and apoptotic enzymes to repress the growth of C.~goreaui. These effects have implications in negative impacts of microplastics on coral-Symbiodiniaceae symbiosis that involves C.~goreaui.},

  abstract = {[author abstract]  The study of microplastic pollution is relatively new in the science of oceanography, with the first paper published in 1972. Since then, many papers have been written in attempts to gain a better understanding of how and where these plastics congregate in the world’s oceans, and what issues arise in turn. Succinctly, this problem is ubiquitous and openly threatens all marine biota. This paper examines the link between higher concentrations of plastics with anthropogenically active and highly populated regions. Six stations were sampled for surface plastics in Puget Sound, starting near Seattle, WA and ending in the open waters outside of Nootka Sound, Canada. A modified Manta net was deployed at each station. The samples were sieved, the plastic pieces picked out under a microscope, counted, and placed into labelled sample jars. Analysis showed higher concentrations were found within Puget Sound, and lower concentrations in the open ocean. A spike towards the high concentration end was also measured near Victoria, B.C. This study furthers the continuous realization that our ocean waters are accumulating plastic pollution, and the largest concentrations are found in waters adjacent to large populations of people and industrial activity.},

There was little effect of incubation temperature or duration of incubation beyond 7 h on extraction efficiency, but DMSO extracts were less stable than acetone extracts during one week of cold storage, especially if they thawed during this period. Since Chl extraction methods may provide variable results, particularly in the field, studies using different solvents should be compared cautiously unless specific methods have been calibrated.},

  abstract = {Cyclic electron flow (CEF) around photosystem I has a role in avoiding photoinhibition of photosystem II (PSII), which occurs under conditions in which the rate of photodamage to PSII exceeds the rate of its repair. However, the molecular mechanism underlying how CEF contributes to photoprotection is not yet well understood. We examined the effect of impairment of CEF and thermal energy dissipation (qE) on photoinhibition using CEF (pgr5) and qE (npq1 and npq4) mutants of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) exposed to strong light. Impairment of CEF by mutation of pgr5 suppressed qE and accelerated photoinhibition. We found that impairment of qE, by mutations of pgr5, npq1, and npq4, caused inhibition of the repair of photodamaged PSII at the step of the de novo synthesis of the D1 protein. In the presence of the chloroplast protein synthesis inhibitor chloramphenicol, impairment of CEF, but not impairment of qE, accelerated photoinhibition, and a similar effect was obtained when leaves were infiltrated with the protonophore nigericin. These results suggest that CEF-dependent generation of ΔpH across the thylakoid membrane helps to alleviate photoinhibition by at least two different photoprotection mechanisms: one is linked to qE generation and prevents the inhibition of the repair of photodamaged PSII at the step of protein synthesis, and the other is independent of qE and suppresses photodamage to PSII.},

Plastic litter can leach a variety of substances into marine environments; however, virtually nothing is known regarding how this affects photosynthetic bacteria at the base of the marine food web. To address this, we investigated the effect of plastic leachate exposure on marine Prochlorococcus, widely considered the most abundant photosynthetic organism on Earth and vital contributors to global primary production and carbon cycling. Two strains of Prochlorococcus representing distinct ecotypes were exposed to leachate from common plastic items: high-density polyethylene bags and polyvinyl chloride matting. We show leachate exposure strongly impairs Prochlorococcus in vitro growth and photosynthetic capacity and results in genome-wide transcriptional changes. The strains showed distinct differences in the extent and timing of their response to each leachate. Consequently, plastic leachate exposure could influence marine Prochlorococcus community composition and potentially the broader composition and productivity of ocean phytoplankton communities., Sasha Tetu et al. have examined the effects of plastic leachate exposure on the marine bacteria Prochlorococcus, the most abundant photosynthetic organism on Earth. They find plastic leachates impair growth, photosynthetic capacity and cause global changes in transcription.},

  abstract = {The cell cycle is a critical component of cellular proliferation, differentiation, and response to stress, yet its role in the regulation of intracellular symbioses is not well understood. To explore host-symbiont cell cycle coordination in a marine symbiosis, we employed a model for coral-dinoflagellate associations: the tropical sea anemone Aiptasia (Exaiptasia pallida) and its native microalgal photosymbionts (Breviolum minutum and Breviolum psygmophilum). Using fluorescent labeling and spatial point-pattern image analyses to characterize cell population distributions in both partners, we developed protocols that are tailored to the three-dimensional cellular landscape of a symbiotic sea anemone tentacle. Introducing cultured symbiont cells to symbiont-free adult hosts increased overall host cell proliferation rates. The acceleration occurred predominantly in the symbiont-containing gastrodermis near clusters of symbionts but was also observed in symbiont-free epidermal tissue layers, indicating that the presence of symbionts contributes to elevated proliferation rates in the entire host during colonization. Symbiont cell cycle progression differed between cultured algae and those residing within hosts; the endosymbiotic state resulted in increased S-phase but decreased G2/M-phase symbiont populations. These phenotypes and the deceleration of cell cycle progression varied with symbiont identity and host nutritional status. These results demonstrate that host and symbiont cells have substantial and species-specific effects on the proliferation rates of their mutualistic partners. This is the first empirical evidence to support species-specific regulation of the symbiont cell cycle within a single cnidarian-dinoflagellate association; similar regulatory mechanisms likely govern interpartner coordination in other coral-algal symbioses and shape their ecophysiological responses to a changing climate. IMPORTANCE Biomass regulation is critical to the overall health of cnidarian-dinoflagellate symbioses. Despite the central role of the cell cycle in the growth and proliferation of cnidarian host cells and dinoflagellate symbionts, there are few studies that have examined the potential for host-symbiont coregulation. This study provides evidence for the acceleration of host cell proliferation when in local proximity to clusters of symbionts within cnidarian tentacles. The findings suggest that symbionts augment the cell cycle of not only their enveloping host cells but also neighboring cells in the epidermis and gastrodermis. This provides a possible mechanism for rapid colonization of cnidarian tissues. In addition, the cell cycles of symbionts differed depending on nutritional regime, symbiotic state, and species identity. The responses of cell cycle profiles to these different factors implicate a role for species-specific regulation of symbiont cell cycles within host cnidarian tissues.},

In this study, a high-resolution high-performance liquid chromatography method integrated with mass spectrometry was applied to obtain the first definitive identification of chlorophyll and carotenoid pigments of three clades of symbiotic dinoflagellate algae (Symbiodinium) in corals, and their response to experimentally elevated temperature and irradiance. The carotenoids peridinin, dinoxanthin, diadinoxanthin (Dn), diatoxanthin (Dt) and β-carotene were detected, together with chlorophylls a and c2, and phaeophytin a, in all three algal clades in unstressed corals. On exposure to elevated temperature and irradiance, three coral species (Montastrea franksi and Favia fragum with clade B algae, and Montastrea cavernosa with clade C) bleached by loss of 50–80\% of their algal cells, with no significant impact to chlorophyll a or c2, or peridinin in retained algal cells. One species (Agaricia sp. with clade C) showed no significant reduction in algal cells at elevated temperature and irradiance, but lost substantial amounts of chlorophyll a and carotenoid pigments, presumably through photo-oxidative processes. Two coral species (Porites astreoides and Porites porites both bearing clade A algae) did not bleach. The impact of elevated temperature and irradiance on the levels of the photoprotective xanthophylls (Dn + Dt) and β-carotene varied among the corals, both in pool size and xanthophyll cycling, and was not correlated to coral bleaching resistance.},

Anemones with exclusively one or the other symbiont were compared under identical conditions. A zooxanthella was about twice the volume and carbon content of a zoochlorella, and contained more chlorophyll. Zooxanthellae population density was 24\% less than zoochlorellae, consequently zooxanthellae protein biomass per unit animal was only 58\% greater than zoochlorellae. The mitotic index (MI) of zoochlorellae was almost 22 times greater than zooxanthellae, and the diel cell division pattern was asynchronous in both algae. Using duration of cytokinesis times (td) of 28 and 69 h for zooxanthellae and zoochlorellae, respectively, we estimated that zoochlorellae grew eight times faster than zooxanthellae. with a commensurately shorter population doubling time. Zooxanthella respiration was two and a half times and net photosynthesis twice that of a zoochlorella; this coupled with a comparatively low growth rate allows the zooxanthellae population to potentially translocate almost five times as much carbon to its host as do zoochlorellae. The contribution of carbon to animal respiration (CZAR) was estimated at 48\% for the zooxanthellate and only 9\% for zoochlorellate anemones. It is suggested that these associations may be similar to ancestral symbioses.},

  abstract = {Throughout its geographic range, the temperate-zone anemone Anthopleura elegantissima is the host of one or both of two distinctively different symbiotic microalgae: a dinoflagellate Symbiodinium (zooxanthellae, ZX) and a chlorophyte (zoochlorellae, ZC). Given the broad vertical intertidal and latitudinal range of this anemone, we investigated the role of temperature in determining whether A. elegantissima supports one algal symbiont over the other and whether temperature regulates the observed distributions of natural populations of ZX and ZC. Temperature appears to be a key factor in regulating both the photophysiology and metabolism of this algal–cnidarian association. In anemones containing ZX, neither algal densities nor chlorophyll content varied with temperature (6–24\,°C); in contrast, anemones with ZC displayed reduced densities and chlorophyll content at the highest temperature treatment (24\,°C). Both ZX and ZC photosynthetic rates were directly related to temperature, as were anemone respiration rates. The higher photosynthetic rates, maintenance of a stable algal density and chlorophyll content, and higher potential contribution of algal carbon toward animal respiration (CZAR) suggest that the ZX are the more viable symbiont as temperature increases, but we suggest alternative reasons why ZC are preserved in this symbiotic association. Elevated temperatures reduce ZC densities and chlorophyll, suggesting that higher temperatures affect this relationship in a negative fashion, presumably due to a higher cost of maintaining ZC by the association; alternatively, these costs may be affiliated with the deterioration of the ZC themselves. These results suggest that temperature may be one of the most significant environmental parameters that sets the intertidal microhabitat and latitudinal distribution patterns of the two algal taxa observed in the field.},

  abstract = {Phytohormones are a class of small organic molecules that are widely used in higher plants and microalgae as chemical messengers. Phytohormones play a regulatory role in the physiological metabolism of cells, including promoting cell division, increasing stress tolerance, and improving photosynthetic efficiency, and thereby increasing biomass, oil, chlorophyll, and protein content. However, traditional abiotic stress methods for inducing the accumulation of energy storage substances in microalgae, such as high light intensity, high salinity, and heavy metals, will affect the growth of microalgae and will ultimately limit the efficient accumulation of energy storage substances. Therefore, the addition of phytohormones not only helps to reduce production costs but also improves the efficiency of biofuel utilization. However, accurate and sensitive phytohormones determination and analytical methods are the basis for plant hormone research. In this study, the characteristics of phytohormones in microalgae and research progress for regulating the accumulation of energy storage substances in microalgae by exogenous phytohormones, combined with abiotic stress conditions at home and abroad, are summarized. The possible metabolic mechanism of phytohormones in microalgae is discussed, and possible future research directions are put forward, which provide a theoretical basis for the application of phytohormones in microalgae.},

Critical studies have revealed the abundance of microplastics in nature, while others have tested the impacts of these small plastics on organismal health in the laboratory. Yet, there is often a mismatch between these two areas of research, resulting in major discrepancies and an inability to interpret certain findings. Here, we focus on several main lines of inquiry. First, even though the majority of environmental microplastics are plastic microfibers from textiles, laboratory studies still largely use spherical microbeads. There are also inconsistencies between the measurements of microplastics in the environment as compared to the concentrations that tend to be used in experimental studies. Likewise, the period of exposure occurring in experimental studies and in the environment are vastly different. Lastly, although experimental studies often focus on a particular subset of toxic chemicals present on microplastics, textile microfibers carry other dyes and chemicals that are understudied. They also cause types of physical damage not associated with microspheres. This review will analyze the literature pertaining to these mismatches, focusing on aquatic organisms and model systems, and seek to inform a path forward for this burgeoning area of research.},

  abstract = {Microplastics are widely distributed in freshwater environments. At present, most of the studies on the toxicity of microplastics are concentrated on aquatic feeding animals, but relatively few have addressed freshwater algae. This study investigated the effect of microplastics (polypropylene (PP) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC)) exposure on the photosynthetic system of freshwater algae over the logarithmic growth period. The results showed that both PVC and PP had a negative effect on chlorophyll a concentrations of Chlorella (C.) pyrenoidosa and Microcystis (M.) flos-aquae; among them, when the concentration of PVC exceeded 250 mg/L, compared with the control group, the chlorophyll a content of C. pyrenoidosa was reduced by 55.23\%. For photosynthetic activity, higher concentrations of PVC and PP can induce lower values of Fv/Fm, Fv/F0, and Fv’/Fm’, suggesting a larger impact in algae. However, algae were able to adjust, with increased values of Fv/Fm, Fv/F0, and Fv’/Fm’. This dose-negative effect phenomenon also exists in the study of the rapid light-response curves. In addition, comparing the two microplastics, we could see that PVC greatly inhibits the photosynthesis system of freshwater algae. Our study confirmed that microplastics can affect algae growth under certain concentrations, which provides evidence for understanding the risks of microplastics.},

  abstract = {Brassinosteroids (BRs) are known to protect crops from the toxicity of herbicides, fungicides and insecticides. It is shown here that application of 24-epibrassinolide (EBR) accelerated metabolism of various pesticides and consequently reduced their residual levels in cucumber (Cucumis sativus L). Chlorpyrifos, a widely used insecticide, caused significant reductions of net photosynthetic rate (Pn) and quantum yield of PSII (ΦPSII) in cucumber leaves. EBR pretreatment alleviated the declines of Pn and ΦPSII caused by chlorpyrifos application, and this effect of EBR was associated with reductions of chlorpyrifos residues. To understand how EBR promotes chlorpyrifos metabolism, the effects of EBR on activity and expression of enzymes involved in pesticide metabolism were analyzed. EBR had a positive effect on the activation of glutathione S-transferase (GST), peroxidase (POD), and glutathione reductase (GR) after treatment with chlorpyrifos, although the effect on GR was attenuated at later time points when plants were treated with 1 mM chlorpyrifos. In addition, EBR enhanced the expression of P450 and MRP, which encode P450 monooxygenase and ABC-type transporter, respectively. However, the expression of GST was consistently lower than that of plants treated with only chlorpyrifos. Importantly, the stimulatory effect of EBR on pesticide metabolism was also observed for cypermethrin, chlorothalonil, and carbendazim, which was attributed to the enhanced activity and genes involved in pesticide metabolism. The results suggest that BRs may be promising, environmentally friendly, natural substances suitable for wide application to reduce the risks of human and environment exposure to pesticides.},

  abstract = {Losses of corals worldwide emphasize the need to understand what drives reef decline. Stressors such as overfishing and nutrient pollution may reduce resilience of coral reefs by increasing coral–algal competition and reducing coral recruitment, growth and survivorship. Such effects may themselves develop via several mechanisms, including disruption of coral microbiomes. Here we report the results of a 3-year field experiment simulating overfishing and nutrient pollution. These stressors increase turf and macroalgal cover, destabilizing microbiomes, elevating putative pathogen loads, increasing disease more than twofold and increasing mortality up to eightfold. Above-average temperatures exacerbate these effects, further disrupting microbiomes of unhealthy corals and concentrating 80\% of mortality in the warmest seasons. Surprisingly, nutrients also increase bacterial opportunism and mortality in corals bitten by parrotfish, turning normal trophic interactions deadly for corals. Thus, overfishing and nutrient pollution impact reefs down to microbial scales, killing corals by sensitizing them to predation, above-average temperatures and bacterial opportunism.},

  abstract = {All animals studied to date are associated with symbiotic communities of microorganisms. These animal microbiotas often play important roles in normal physiological function and susceptibility to disease; predicting their responses to perturbation represents an essential challenge for microbiology. Most studies of microbiome dynamics test for patterns in which perturbation shifts animal microbiomes from a healthy to a dysbiotic stable state. Here, we consider a complementary alternative: that the microbiological changes induced by many perturbations are stochastic, and therefore lead to transitions from stable to unstable community states. The result is an ‘Anna Karenina principle’ for animal microbiomes, in which dysbiotic individuals vary more in microbial community composition than healthy individuals—paralleling Leo Tolstoy's dictum that “all happy families look alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way”. We argue that Anna Karenina effects are a common and important response of animal microbiomes to stressors that reduce the ability of the host or its microbiome to regulate community composition. Patterns consistent with Anna Karenina effects have been found in systems ranging from the surface of threatened corals exposed to above-average temperatures, to the lungs of patients suffering from HIV/AIDs. However, despite their apparent ubiquity, these patterns are easily missed or discarded by some common workflows, and therefore probably underreported. Now that a substantial body of research has established the existence of these patterns in diverse systems, rigorous testing, intensive time-series datasets and improved stochastic modelling will help to explore their importance for topics ranging from personalized medicine to theories of the evolution of host–microorganism symbioses.},

  abstract = {Given the ubiquitous presence of microplastics in aquatic environments, an evaluation of their toxicity is essential. Microplastics are a heterogeneous set of materials that differ not only in particle properties, like size and shape, but also in chemical composition, including polymers, additives and side products. Thus far, it remains unknown whether the plastic chemicals or the particle itself are the driving factor for microplastic toxicity. To address this question, we exposed Daphnia magna for 21 days to irregular polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyurethane (PUR) and polylactic acid (PLA) microplastics as well as to natural kaolin particles in high concentrations (10, 50, 100, 500~mg/L, ≤ 59~μm) and different exposure scenarios, including microplastics and microplastics without extractable chemicals as well as the extracted and migrating chemicals alone. All three microplastic types negatively affected the life-history of D.~magna. However, this toxicity depended on the endpoint and the material. While PVC had the largest effect on reproduction, PLA reduced survival most effectively. The latter indicates that bio-based and biodegradable plastics can be as toxic as their conventional counterparts. The natural particle kaolin was less toxic than microplastics when comparing numerical concentrations. Importantly, the contribution of plastic chemicals to the toxicity was also plastic type-specific. While we can attribute effects of PVC to the chemicals used in the material, effects of PUR and PLA plastics were induced by the mere particle. Our study demonstrates that plastic chemicals can drive microplastic toxicity. This highlights the importance of considering the individual chemical composition of plastics when assessing their environmental risks. Our results suggest that less studied polymer types, like PVC and PUR, as well as bioplastics are of particular toxicological relevance and should get a higher priority in ecotoxicological studies.},
