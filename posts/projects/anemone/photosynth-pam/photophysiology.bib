  abstract = {The use of DMSO for the extraction and determination of chlorophylls a and b in lichens and higher plants was reevaluated. Because of differences between the absorption spectra of pure chlorophylls a and b in DMSO and 80\% acetone, formulae to calculate the individual concentrations of chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b and total (a + b) chlorophyll in pigment extracts were redetermined for specific use with DMSO. In lichens, the problem of chlorophyll degradation resulting from the presence of acidic lichen substances was specifically addressed. Repeated washing of thalli with carbonate-saturated 100\% acetone followed by extraction in DMSO containing PVPi minimized the conversion of chlorophylls to phaeophytin during extraction of chlorophylls from lichens for which the content of lichen substances was characterized. In lichens containing significant quantities of acidic compounds, the modified DMSO assay proved superior to 80\% acetone for the extraction and determination of chlorophyll a and b concentrations. In a range of higher plants, determinations of chlorophyll a and b concentrations were virtually identical when the modified DMSO assay was compared with the traditional method of chlorophyll extraction using 80\% acetone. Moreover, DMSO extracts could be cold-stored for up to 7 days with no significant loss of chlorophylls a or b, or changes in the a/b ratio. Potential eco-physiological applications of the modified DMSO assay, which eliminates the necessity for grinding plant material and centrifuging plant extracts, are discussed.},

  abstract = {Due to its widespread use, large amounts of expanded polystyrene (EPS) have been released into the marine environment, where it is broken down into small pieces with large surface areas. As such, chemical additives may be released into the environment, which can affect marine organisms; however, studies of the effects of such additives are lacking. We assessed the effects of leachate from EPS on the photosynthetic activities of four microalgal species (Dunaliella salina, Scenedesmus rubescens, Chlorella saccharophila, and Stichococcus bacillaris). They were exposed to EPS leachate for seven days and their photosynthetic activities were analyzed based on seven parameters. Overall, leachate exposure increased photosynthetic activity in all four species, albeit to different degrees and showing slightly different trends among the seven parameters. Based on chemical analysis, hexabromocyclododecane concentrations were higher in small-fragment leachate, whereas UV326 concentrations were higher in low-concentration-large-sphere leachate; bisphenol-A and total organic carbon showed no major differences among leachates. Thus, we speculate that exposure to trace chemicals influenced microalgal photosynthesis and overall growth. These results support further investigation of the impacts of plastic debris and chemical additives on marine ecosystems and organisms.},

  abstract = {The breakdown of the symbiosis between cnidarians and Symbiodiniaceae often occurs upon periods of elevated sea surface temperature and gives rise to bleaching events that affect coral reefs worldwide. In this respect, an impairment of photosynthesis would be responsible for light-dependent generation of toxic reactive oxygen species putatively contributing to death of symbionts and/or host cells. In some Symbiodiniaceae species, alternative photosynthetic electron flows (AEF) have been documented to occur upon a shift to high temperature, possibly contributing to photoprotection and to the balance of energetic ratio between photoproduced ATP and NADPH. By using a combination of in vivo spectrofluorimetric and oximetric techniques, we studied the capacity for electron rerouting toward oxygen and cyclic electron flow (CEF) around photosystem I in eight Symbiodiniaceae in culture belonging to Symbiodinium and Breviolum genera upon an acute shift from 25 to 33◦C. CEF capacity was determined as the kinetic of PSI primary donor P700 re-reduction in the presence of DCMU, a PSII inhibitor. An active oxygen uptake in light was estimated by comparing net oxygen evolution and relative electron transport rate of PSII at different light intensities. Among strains that showed elevated capacity for both AEF, some were thermotolerant while others were thermosensitive. Conversely, in some thermotolerant strains, capacities for these AEF were low upon acute heat stress. A principal component analysis of these results indicates that the long-term heat tolerant/bleached phenotype of cultured Symbiodinium and Breviolum spp. is not correlated with a capacity for different AEF across isolates during early onset of acute heat stress.},

  abstract = {Associating with algal symbionts is considered largely beneficial for cnidarians such as corals and sea anemones, yet there are potential costs of hosting symbionts, such as the production of reactive oxygen species. We compared the photophysiology and H2O2 production rates of Symbiodinium muscatinei and Elliptochloris marina, the dinoflagellate and chlorophyte symbionts, respectively, of the temperate sea anemone Anthopleura elegantissima. Analyses of photosystem II (PSII) function in the two symbionts, including maximum quantum yield and relative electron transport rates, were consistent with prior studies indicating that E. marina has lower photosynthetic performance than S. muscatinei at high temperature and irradiance. The efficiency of PSII in both symbionts was positively affected by the addition of exogenous catalase, suggesting that both symbionts experience H2O2-mediated declines in PSII efficiency. We found that S. muscatinei produced more H2O2 than E. marina across all treatments, with the highest production under high light and temperature. Results were similar in experiments involving both isolated symbionts and symbionts residing within intact tentacles, indicating that the potential stress of symbiont isolation was not a significant factor biasing our results. Despite the lower typical densities of S. muscatinei relative to E. marina, extrapolations of cell-specific H2O2 production rates to the intact symbiosis suggest that S. muscatinei imposes a greater H2O2 burden on A. elegantissima. Even with this burden, however, the considerably higher productivity and fitness of S. muscatinei-bearing anemones documented in prior studies suggests that the net benefit of hosting S. muscatinei exceeds that of E. marina.},

  abstract = {Background: Reef corals are heterotrophic coelenterates that achieve high productivity through their photosynthetic dinoflagellate symbionts. Excessive seawater temperature destabilises this symbiosis and causes corals to ‘‘bleach,’’ lowering their photosynthetic capacity. Bleaching poses a serious threat to the persistence of coral reefs on a global scale. Despite expanding research on the causes of bleaching, the mechanisms remain a subject of debate. Methodology/Principal Findings: This study determined how light and food availability modulate the effects of temperature stress on photosynthesis in two reef coral species. We quantified the activities of Photosystem II, Photosystem I and whole chain electron transport under combinations of normal and stressful growth temperatures, moderate and high light levels and the presence or absence of feeding of the coral hosts. Our results show that PS1 function is comparatively robust against temperature stress in both species, whereas PS2 and whole chain electron transport are susceptible to temperature stress. In the symbiotic dinoflagellates of Stylophora pistillata the contents of chlorophyll and major photosynthetic complexes were primarily affected by food availability. In Turbinaria reniformis growth temperature was the dominant influence on the contents of the photosynthetic complexes. In both species feeding the host significantly protected photosynthetic function from high temperature stress. Conclusions/Significance: Our findings support the photoinhibition model of coral bleaching and demonstrate that PS1 is not a major site for thermal damage during bleaching events. Feeding mitigates bleaching in two scleractinian corals, so that reef responses to temperature stresses will likely be influenced by the coinciding availabilities of prey for the host.},

  abstract = {Short-and long-duration light curves were applied to four macroalgae (Ulva sp., Codium fragile, Ecklonia radiata and Lessonia variegata), and two microalgal species (Chlorella emersonii and Chaetoceros muellerii). With increasing light curve duration, the maximal relative electron transport rate increased by a factor of three in E. radiata, and by factors of 1.25 and 1.23 in C. emersonii and L. variegata, respectively, but did not change in C. fragile and Ch. muellerii. The light saturation point Ek increased by 26 ␮mol photons m−2 s−1 in C. emersonii and 20 ␮mol photons m−2 s−1 in Ch. muellerii and E. radiata with elevated light curve exposure times. Oscillatory patterns of the continuous fluorescence readings reflect accumulation of QA. Continuous fluorescence values increased, or decreased, by approximately 10\% within light curve increments. However, oscillations of 25\% were not uncommon, which shows that cells are changing their photophysiological response state during steady light conditions. Increasing dark acclimation times prior to light curve application lowered maximal relative electron transport rates in the C. emersonii (from 28 ± 1.7 to 25 ± 1.2 for 15 and 95 min dark acclimation in short-duration light curves respectively). This effect was counterbalanced by longer light curve application. It can therefore be concluded that manipulation of light exposure and dark incubation prior to the experiment affects the photosynthetic response, presumably due to different activation states of photosynthetic and photoprotective mechanisms. The highly speciesspecific photo-response patterns imply that a common rapid light curve protocol will generate artefacts in some species.},

  abstract = {There is currently much debate about the ecological advantages for reef corals of hosting multiple types of the symbiotic dinoflagellate Symbiodinium. Amongst these is their apparent capacity to tolerate higher than normal water temperatures. There is strong photokinetic evidence that the trait of heat-tolerance in plants is accompanied by energetic tradeoffs but little such evidence yet exists for corals. We use rapid light curves (RLCs) to investigate the photokinetic basis for thermo-tolerance in the reef coral Acropora millepora with symbionts of contrasting thermal tolerance for which there are measured differences in energetics. Our results show that under non-stressful temperatures, corals with heat-tolerant type D Symbiodinium had a 41\% lower maximum relative electron transport rate (rETRmax) and lower light absorption efficiency (α) due to lower cell Chl a content compared with corals with heat-sensitive type C2 symbionts. Our results provide support for a photokinetic link between heat tolerance and deficits in holobiont (coral + symbiont) growth, lipid stores and reproduction. Reduced electron transport rate and light absorption capacity may be genotype-specific attributes that enable clade D symbionts and their cnidarian hosts to cope with temperature stress but they inherently influence the photosynthetic function of the symbionts and thus have negative downstream effects on the coral.},

  abstract = {Plastids and mitochondria each arose from a single endosymbiotic event and share many similarities in how they were reduced and integrated with their host. However, the subsequent evolution of the two organelles could hardly be more different: mitochondria are a stable fixture of eukaryotic cells that are neither lost nor shuffled between lineages, whereas plastid evolution has been a complex mix of movement, loss and replacement. Molecular data from the past decade have substantially untangled this complex history, and we now know that plastids are derived from a single endosymbiotic event in the ancestor of glaucophytes, red algae and green algae (including plants). The plastids of both red algae and green algae were subsequently transferred to other lineages by secondary endosymbiosis. Green algal plastids were taken up by euglenids and chlorarachniophytes, as well as one small group of dinoflagellates. Red algae appear to have been taken up only once, giving rise to a diverse group called chromalveolates. Additional layers of complexity come from plastid loss, which has happened at least once and probably many times, and replacement. Plastid loss is difficult to prove, and cryptic, non-photosynthetic plastids are being found in many non-photosynthetic lineages. In other cases, photosynthetic lineages are now understood to have evolved from ancestors with a plastid of different origin, so an ancestral plastid has been replaced with a new one. Such replacement has taken place in several dinoflagellates (by tertiary endosymbiosis with other chromalveolates or serial secondary endosymbiosis with a green alga), and apparently also in two rhizarian lineages: chlorarachniophytes and               Paulinella               (which appear to have evolved from chromalveolate ancestors). The many twists and turns of plastid evolution each represent major evolutionary transitions, and each offers a glimpse into how genomes evolve and how cells integrate through gene transfers and protein trafficking.},

Biofilm responses were evaluated after 1, 5, 7 and 14 days of exposure to the different toxicants. Overall, the responses of both “classical fluorescence parameters” and RLC endpoints were highly time dependent and related to the mode of action of the different compounds. Interestingly, parameters calculated from RLCs (α, ETRmax and Ik) were useful early markers of pesticide exposure since they revealed significant effects of all the tested toxicants from the first day of exposure. In comparison, classical fluorescence endpoints (F0 and Fv/Fm) measured at day 1 were only affected in the DCPMU treatment. Our results demonstrated the interest of RLCs as early markers of toxicant exposure particularly when working with toxicants with less specific mode of action than PSII inhibitors.},

  abstract = {Carbonic anhydrases (CA; EC 4.2.1.1) play a vital role in dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) transport to photosynthetic microalgae residing in symbiotic cnidarians. The temperate sea anemone Anthopleura elegantissima can occur in three symbiotic states: hosting Breviolum muscatinei (brown), hosting Elliptochloris marina (green) or without algal symbionts (aposymbiotic). This provides a basis for A. elegantissima to be a model for detailed studies of the role of CA in DIC transport. This study investigated the effects of symbiosis, body size and light on CA activity and expression, and suggests that A. elegantissima has a heterotrophy-dominated trophic strategy. We identified putative A. elegantissima CA genes and performed phylogenetic analyses to infer subcellular localization in anemones. We performed experiments on field-collected anemones to compare: (1) CA activity and expression from anemones in different symbiotic states, (2) CA activity in brown anemones as a function of size, and (3) CA activity in anemones of different symbiotic states that were exposed to different light intensities. CA activity in brown anemones was highest, whereas activity in green and aposymbiotic anemones was low. Several CAs had expression patterns that mirrored activity, while another had expression that was inversely correlated with activity, suggesting that symbionts may induce different DIC transport pathways. Finally, CA activity was inversely correlated with anemone size. Our results suggest that the observed CA activity and expression patterns are affected not only by symbiosis, but also by other factors in the host physiology, including trophic strategy as it relates to body size and cellular pH homeostasis.},

  abstract = {In studies of both the establishment and breakdown of cnidarian-dinoflagellate symbiosis, it is often necessary to determine the number of Symbiodinium cells relative to the quantity of host tissue. Ideally, the methods used should be rapid, precise, and accurate. In this study, we systematically evaluated methods for sample preparation and storage and the counting of algal cells using the hemocytometer, a custom image-analysis program for automated counting of the fluorescent algal cells, the Coulter Counter, or the Millipore Guava flow-cytometer. We found that although other methods may have value in particular applications, for most purposes, the Guava flow cytometer provided by far the best combination of precision, accuracy, and efficient use of investigator time (due to the instrument's automated sample handling), while also allowing counts of algal numbers over a wide range and in small volumes of tissue homogenate. We also found that either of two assays of total homogenate protein provided a precise and seemingly accurate basis for normalization of algal counts to the total amount of holobiont tissue.},

Photosynthesis, an interface between non-living matter and living organisms, is very important for both energy flow and material circulation on our planet. Increasing evidence indicates that MNPs can pose direct or indirect stress effects on photoautotrophs, however, our knowledge about them is still limited. The purposes of this mini-review are (1) to review the latest literature of the impacts of MNPs on photosynthesis activities and summarize diverse impacts of MNPs on photosynthesis activities of different photoautotrophs (green plants, microalgae, and cyanobacteria); (2) to discuss the potential action mechanisms in both aquatic and terrestrial environments; and (3) various factors contributing toward these impacts. Additionally, this review provides key future research directions for both researchers and policymakers to better understand and alleviate the environmental impacts of MNPs on our planet.},

  abstract = {Chlorophyll fluorescence is a non-invasive measurement of photosystem II (PSII) activity and is a commonly used technique in plant physiology. The sensitivity of PSII activity to abiotic and biotic factors has made this a key technique not only for understanding the photosynthetic mechanisms but also as a broader indicator of how plants respond to environmental change. This, along with low cost and ease of collecting data, has resulted in the appearance of a large array of instrument types for measurement and calculated parameters which can be bewildering for the new user. Moreover, its accessibility can lead to misuse and misinterpretation when the underlying photosynthetic processes are not fully appreciated. This review is timely because it sits at a point of renewed interest in chlorophyll fluorescence where fast measurements of photosynthetic performance are now required for crop improvement purposes. Here we help the researcher make choices in terms of protocols using the equipment and expertise available, especially for field measurements. We start with a basic overview of the principles of fluorescence analysis and provide advice on best practice for taking pulse amplitude-modulated measurements. We also discuss a number of emerging techniques for contemporary crop and ecology research, where we see continual development and application of analytical techniques to meet the new challenges that have arisen in recent years. We end the review by briefly discussing the emerging area of monitoring fluorescence, chlorophyll fluorescence imaging, field phenotyping, and remote sensing of crops for yield and biomass enhancement.},

  abstract = {Warming and nutrient limitation are stressors known to weaken the health of microalgae. In situations of stress, access to energy reserves can minimize physiological damage. Because of its widespread requirements in biochemical processes, iron is an important trace metal, especially for photosynthetic organisms. Lowered iron availability in oceans experiencing rising temperatures may contribute to the thermal sensitivity of reef-building corals, which rely on mutualisms with dinoflagellates to survive. To test the influence of iron concentration on thermal sensitivity, the physiological responses of cultured symbiotic dinoflagellates (genus Breviolum; family Symbiodiniaceae) were evaluated when exposed to increasing temperatures (26 to 30°C) and iron concentrations ranging from replete (500 pM Fe’) to limiting (50 pM Fe’) under a diurnal light cycle with saturating radiance. Declines in photosynthetic efficiency at elevated temperatures indicated sensitivity to heat stress. Furthermore, five times the amount of iron was needed to reach exponential growth during heat stress (50 pM Fe′ at 26–28°C vs. 250 pM Fe′ at 30°C). In treatments where exponential growth was reached, Breviolum psygmophilum grew faster than B.minutum, possibly due to greater cellular contents of iron and other trace metals. The metal composition of B.psygmophilum shifted only at the highest temperature (30°C), whereas changes in B.minutum were observed at lower temperatures (28°C). The influence of iron availability in modulating each alga’s response to thermal stress suggests the importance of trace metals to the health of coral-algal mutualisms. Ultimately, a greater ability to acquire scarce metals may improve the tolerance of corals to physiological stressors and contribute to the differences in performance associated with hosting one symbiont species over another.},

  abstract = {Cnidarians in symbiosis with photosynthetic protists must withstand daily hyperoxic/anoxic transitions within their host cells. Comparative studies between symbiotic (Anemonia viridis) and non-symbiotic (Actinia schmidti) sea anemones show striking differences in their response to oxidative stress. First, the basal expression of SOD is very different. Symbiotic animal cells have a higher isoform diversity (number and classes) and a higher activity than the non-symbiotic cells. Second, the symbiotic animal cells of A. viridis also maintain unaltered basal values for cellular damage when exposed to experimental hyperoxia (100\% O(2)) or to experimental thermal stress (elevated temperature +7 degrees C above ambient). Under such conditions, A. schmidti modifies its SOD activity significantly. Electrophoretic patterns diversify, global activities diminish and cell damage biomarkers increase. These data suggest symbiotic cells adapt to stress while non-symbiotic cells remain acutely sensitive. In addition to being toxic, high O(2) partial pressure (P(O(2))) may also constitute a preconditioning step for symbiotic animal cells, leading to an adaptation to the hyperoxic condition and, thus, to oxidative stress. Furthermore, in aposymbiotic animal cells of A. viridis, repression of some animal SOD isoforms is observed. Meanwhile, in cultured symbionts, new activity bands are induced, suggesting that the host might protect its zooxanthellae in hospite. Similar results have been observed in other symbiotic organisms, such as the sea anemone Aiptasia pulchella and the scleractinian coral Stylophora pistillata. Molecular or physical interactions between the two symbiotic partners may explain such variations in SOD activity and might confer oxidative stress tolerance to the animal host.},

The presence of phaeophytin (Ph) a not only interferes with estimates of Chl a but also with Chl b and c determinations. The universal algorithms can hence be misleading if used on natural collections containing large amounts of Ph. The methanol algorithms are severely affected by the presence of Ph and so are not recommended. The algorithms were tested on representative mixtures of Chls prepared from extracts of algae with known Chl composition. The limits of detection (and inherent error, ±95 \% confidence limit) for all the Chl equations were less than 0.03 g m−3. The algorithms are both accurate and precise for Chl a and d but less accurate for Chl b and c. With caution the algorithms can be used to calculate a Chl profile of natural assemblages of algae. The relative error of measurements of Chls increases hyperbolically in diluted extracts. For safety reasons, efficient extraction of Chls and the convenience of being able to use polystyrene cuvettes, the algorithms for ethanol are recommended for routine assays of Chls in natural assemblages of aquatic plants.},

DMSO solvent offers the advantages of low volatility, low toxicity, low flammability, biodegradability, and ease of transport and is an effective extractant of chlorophylls.

  abstract = {Ocean warming driven bleaching is one of the greatest threats to zooxanthellate cnidarians in the Anthropocene. Bleaching is the loss of Symbiodiniaceae, chlorophyll, or both from zooxanthellate animals. To quantify bleaching and recovery, standardised methods for quantification of Symbiodiniaceae and chlorophyll concentrations have been developed for reef-building scleractinian corals, but no such standard method has been developed for octocorals. For stony corals, quantification of Symbiodiniaceae and chlorophyll concentrations often relies on normalisation to skeletal surface area or unit of biomass (i.e. protein, ash-free dry weight (AFDW)). Stiff octocorals do not change their volume, as such studies have used volume and surface area to standardise densities, but soft-bodied octocorals can alter their size using water movement within the animal; therefore, Symbiodiniaceae and chlorophyll cannot accurately be measured per unit of surface area and are instead measured in units of Symbiodiniaceae and chlorophyll per µg of host protein or AFDW. Though AFDW is more representative of the full biomass composition than host protein, AFDW is more time and resource intensive. Here we provide a streamlined methodology to quantify Symbiodiniaceae density, chlorophyll concentration, and protein content in soft-bodied octocorals. This technique uses minimal equipment, does not require freeze-drying or burning samples to obtain ash weight, and is effective for down to 0.2 grams wet tissue. Bulk samples can be centrifuged, the Symbiodiniaceae pellet washed, and the supernatant saved for protein analysis. This efficient technique allows for clean, easy to count samples of Symbiodiniaceae with minimal animal protein contamination. Chlorophyll a and c2 extractions occurs at different rates, with chlorophyll a taking 24 hours to extract completely at 4°C and chlorophyll c2 taking 48 hours. Finally, we found that where necessary, wet weight may be used as a proxy for protein content, but the correlation of protein and wet weight varies by species and protein should be used when possible. Overall, we have created a rapid and accurate method for quantification of bleaching markers in octocorals.},

We found that Chl extraction of whole leaf tissue with DMSO incubated at between 25 and 40 degrees C was generally similar to the 80\% acetone method, except for one graminoid species that required maceration. There was little effect of incubation temperature or duration of incubation beyond 7 h on extraction efficiency, but DMSO extracts were less stable than acetone extracts during one week of cold storage, especially if they thawed during this period. Since Chl extraction methods may provide variable results, particularly in the field, studies using different solvents should be compared cautiously unless specific methods have been calibrated.},

  abstract = {Cyclic electron flow (CEF) around photosystem I has a role in avoiding photoinhibition of photosystem II (PSII), which occurs under conditions in which the rate of photodamage to PSII exceeds the rate of its repair. However, the molecular mechanism underlying how CEF contributes to photoprotection is not yet well understood. We examined the effect of impairment of CEF and thermal energy dissipation (qE) on photoinhibition using CEF (pgr5) and qE (npq1 and npq4) mutants of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) exposed to strong light. Impairment of CEF by mutation of pgr5 suppressed qE and accelerated photoinhibition. We found that impairment of qE, by mutations of pgr5, npq1, and npq4, caused inhibition of the repair of photodamaged PSII at the step of the de novo synthesis of the D1 protein. In the presence of the chloroplast protein synthesis inhibitor chloramphenicol, impairment of CEF, but not impairment of qE, accelerated photoinhibition, and a similar effect was obtained when leaves were infiltrated with the protonophore nigericin. These results suggest that CEF-dependent generation of ΔpH across the thylakoid membrane helps to alleviate photoinhibition by at least two different photoprotection mechanisms: one is linked to qE generation and prevents the inhibition of the repair of photodamaged PSII at the step of protein synthesis, and the other is independent of qE and suppresses photodamage to PSII.},

  abstract = {Plastic pollution is a global threat to marine ecosystems. Plastic litter can leach a variety of substances into marine environments; however, virtually nothing is known regarding how this affects photosynthetic bacteria at the base of the marine food web. To address this, we investigated the effect of plastic leachate exposure on marine Prochlorococcus, widely considered the most abundant photosynthetic organism on Earth and vital contributors to global primary production and carbon cycling. Two strains of Prochlorococcus representing distinct ecotypes were exposed to leachate from common plastic items: high-density polyethylene bags and polyvinyl chloride matting. We show leachate exposure strongly impairs Prochlorococcus in vitro growth and photosynthetic capacity and results in genome-wide transcriptional changes. The strains showed distinct differences in the extent and timing of their response to each leachate. Consequently, plastic leachate exposure could influence marine Prochlorococcus community composition and potentially the broader composition and productivity of ocean phytoplankton communities., Sasha Tetu et al. have examined the effects of plastic leachate exposure on the marine bacteria Prochlorococcus, the most abundant photosynthetic organism on Earth. They find plastic leachates impair growth, photosynthetic capacity and cause global changes in transcription.},

  abstract = {The cell cycle is a critical component of cellular proliferation, differentiation, and response to stress, yet its role in the regulation of intracellular symbioses is not well understood. To explore host-symbiont cell cycle coordination in a marine symbiosis, we employed a model for coral-dinoflagellate associations: the tropical sea anemone Aiptasia (Exaiptasia pallida) and its native microalgal photosymbionts (Breviolum minutum and Breviolum psygmophilum). Using fluorescent labeling and spatial point-pattern image analyses to characterize cell population distributions in both partners, we developed protocols that are tailored to the three-dimensional cellular landscape of a symbiotic sea anemone tentacle. Introducing cultured symbiont cells to symbiont-free adult hosts increased overall host cell proliferation rates. The acceleration occurred predominantly in the symbiont-containing gastrodermis near clusters of symbionts but was also observed in symbiont-free epidermal tissue layers, indicating that the presence of symbionts contributes to elevated proliferation rates in the entire host during colonization. Symbiont cell cycle progression differed between cultured algae and those residing within hosts; the endosymbiotic state resulted in increased S-phase but decreased G2/M-phase symbiont populations. These phenotypes and the deceleration of cell cycle progression varied with symbiont identity and host nutritional status. These results demonstrate that host and symbiont cells have substantial and species-specific effects on the proliferation rates of their mutualistic partners. This is the first empirical evidence to support species-specific regulation of the symbiont cell cycle within a single cnidarian-dinoflagellate association; similar regulatory mechanisms likely govern interpartner coordination in other coral-algal symbioses and shape their ecophysiological responses to a changing climate. IMPORTANCE Biomass regulation is critical to the overall health of cnidarian-dinoflagellate symbioses. Despite the central role of the cell cycle in the growth and proliferation of cnidarian host cells and dinoflagellate symbionts, there are few studies that have examined the potential for host-symbiont coregulation. This study provides evidence for the acceleration of host cell proliferation when in local proximity to clusters of symbionts within cnidarian tentacles. The findings suggest that symbionts augment the cell cycle of not only their enveloping host cells but also neighboring cells in the epidermis and gastrodermis. This provides a possible mechanism for rapid colonization of cnidarian tissues. In addition, the cell cycles of symbionts differed depending on nutritional regime, symbiotic state, and species identity. The responses of cell cycle profiles to these different factors implicate a role for species-specific regulation of symbiont cell cycles within host cnidarian tissues.},

  abstract = {Bleaching of corals by loss of symbiotic dinoflagellate algae and/or photosynthetic pigments is commonly triggered by elevated temperatures coupled with high irradiance, and is a first-order threat to coral reef communities. In this study, a high-resolution high-performance liquid chromatography method integrated with mass spectrometry was applied to obtain the first definitive identification of chlorophyll and carotenoid pigments of three clades of symbiotic dinoflagellate algae (Symbiodinium) in corals, and their response to experimentally elevated temperature and irradiance. The carotenoids peridinin, dinoxanthin, diadinoxanthin (Dn), diatoxanthin (Dt) and β-carotene were detected, together with chlorophylls a and c2, and phaeophytin a, in all three algal clades in unstressed corals. On exposure to elevated temperature and irradiance, three coral species (Montastrea franksi and Favia fragum with clade B algae, and Montastrea cavernosa with clade C) bleached by loss of 50–80\% of their algal cells, with no significant impact to chlorophyll a or c2, or peridinin in retained algal cells. One species (Agaricia sp. with clade C) showed no significant reduction in algal cells at elevated temperature and irradiance, but lost substantial amounts of chlorophyll a and carotenoid pigments, presumably through photo-oxidative processes. Two coral species (Porites astreoides and Porites porites both bearing clade A algae) did not bleach. The impact of elevated temperature and irradiance on the levels of the photoprotective xanthophylls (Dn + Dt) and β-carotene varied among the corals, both in pool size and xanthophyll cycling, and was not correlated to coral bleaching resistance.},

  abstract = {Phytohormones are a class of small organic molecules that are widely used in higher plants and microalgae as chemical messengers. Phytohormones play a regulatory role in the physiological metabolism of cells, including promoting cell division, increasing stress tolerance, and improving photosynthetic efficiency, and thereby increasing biomass, oil, chlorophyll, and protein content. However, traditional abiotic stress methods for inducing the accumulation of energy storage substances in microalgae, such as high light intensity, high salinity, and heavy metals, will affect the growth of microalgae and will ultimately limit the efficient accumulation of energy storage substances. Therefore, the addition of phytohormones not only helps to reduce production costs but also improves the efficiency of biofuel utilization. However, accurate and sensitive phytohormones determination and analytical methods are the basis for plant hormone research. In this study, the characteristics of phytohormones in microalgae and research progress for regulating the accumulation of energy storage substances in microalgae by exogenous phytohormones, combined with abiotic stress conditions at home and abroad, are summarized. The possible metabolic mechanism of phytohormones in microalgae is discussed, and possible future research directions are put forward, which provide a theoretical basis for the application of phytohormones in microalgae.},

At present, most of the studies on the toxicity of microplastics are concentrated on aquatic feeding animals, but relatively few have addressed freshwater algae. This study investigated the effect of microplastics (polypropylene (PP) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC)) exposure on the photosynthetic system of freshwater algae over the logarithmic growth period. The results showed that both PVC and PP had a negative effect on chlorophyll a concentrations of Chlorella (C.) pyrenoidosa and Microcystis (M.) flos-aquae; among them, when the concentration of PVC exceeded 250 mg/L, compared with the control group, the chlorophyll a content of C. pyrenoidosa was reduced by 55.23\%. For photosynthetic activity, higher concentrations of PVC and PP can induce lower values of Fv/Fm, Fv/F0, and Fv’/Fm’, suggesting a larger impact in algae. However, algae were able to adjust, with increased values of Fv/Fm, Fv/F0, and Fv’/Fm’. This dose-negative effect phenomenon also exists in the study of the rapid light-response curves. In addition, comparing the two microplastics, we could see that PVC greatly inhibits the photosynthesis system of freshwater algae. Our study confirmed that microplastics can affect algae growth under certain concentrations, which provides evidence for understanding the risks of microplastics.},

  abstract = {Brassinosteroids (BRs) are known to protect crops from the toxicity of herbicides, fungicides and insecticides. It is shown here that application of 24-epibrassinolide (EBR) accelerated metabolism of various pesticides and consequently reduced their residual levels in cucumber (Cucumis sativus L). Chlorpyrifos, a widely used insecticide, caused significant reductions of net photosynthetic rate (Pn) and quantum yield of PSII (ΦPSII) in cucumber leaves. EBR pretreatment alleviated the declines of Pn and ΦPSII caused by chlorpyrifos application, and this effect of EBR was associated with reductions of chlorpyrifos residues. To understand how EBR promotes chlorpyrifos metabolism, the effects of EBR on activity and expression of enzymes involved in pesticide metabolism were analyzed. EBR had a positive effect on the activation of glutathione S-transferase (GST), peroxidase (POD), and glutathione reductase (GR) after treatment with chlorpyrifos, although the effect on GR was attenuated at later time points when plants were treated with 1 mM chlorpyrifos. In addition, EBR enhanced the expression of P450 and MRP, which encode P450 monooxygenase and ABC-type transporter, respectively. However, the expression of GST was consistently lower than that of plants treated with only chlorpyrifos. Importantly, the stimulatory effect of EBR on pesticide metabolism was also observed for cypermethrin, chlorothalonil, and carbendazim, which was attributed to the enhanced activity and genes involved in pesticide metabolism. The results suggest that BRs may be promising, environmentally friendly, natural substances suitable for wide application to reduce the risks of human and environment exposure to pesticides.},
