  abstract = {Due to its widespread use, large amounts of expanded polystyrene (EPS) have been released into the marine environment, where it is broken down into small pieces with large surface areas. As such, chemical additives may be released into the environment, which can affect marine organisms; however, studies of the effects of such additives are lacking. We assessed the effects of leachate from EPS on the photosynthetic activities of four microalgal species (Dunaliella salina, Scenedesmus rubescens, Chlorella saccharophila, and Stichococcus bacillaris). They were exposed to EPS leachate for seven days and their photosynthetic activities were analyzed based on seven parameters. Overall, leachate exposure increased photosynthetic activity in all four species, albeit to different degrees and showing slightly different trends among the seven parameters. Based on chemical analysis, hexabromocyclododecane concentrations were higher in small-fragment leachate, whereas UV326 concentrations were higher in low-concentration-large-sphere leachate; bisphenol-A and total organic carbon showed no major differences among leachates. Thus, we speculate that exposure to trace chemicals influenced microalgal photosynthesis and overall growth. These results support further investigation of the impacts of plastic debris and chemical additives on marine ecosystems and organisms.},

  abstract = {Associating with algal symbionts is considered largely beneficial for cnidarians such as corals and sea anemones, yet there are potential costs of hosting symbionts, such as the production of reactive oxygen species. We compared the photophysiology and H2O2 production rates of Symbiodinium muscatinei and Elliptochloris marina, the dinoflagellate and chlorophyte symbionts, respectively, of the temperate sea anemone Anthopleura elegantissima. Analyses of photosystem II (PSII) function in the two symbionts, including maximum quantum yield and relative electron transport rates, were consistent with prior studies indicating that E. marina has lower photosynthetic performance than S. muscatinei at high temperature and irradiance. The efficiency of PSII in both symbionts was positively affected by the addition of exogenous catalase, suggesting that both symbionts experience H2O2-mediated declines in PSII efficiency. We found that S. muscatinei produced more H2O2 than E. marina across all treatments, with the highest production under high light and temperature. Results were similar in experiments involving both isolated symbionts and symbionts residing within intact tentacles, indicating that the potential stress of symbiont isolation was not a significant factor biasing our results. Despite the lower typical densities of S. muscatinei relative to E. marina, extrapolations of cell-specific H2O2 production rates to the intact symbiosis suggest that S. muscatinei imposes a greater H2O2 burden on A. elegantissima. Even with this burden, however, the considerably higher productivity and fitness of S. muscatinei-bearing anemones documented in prior studies suggests that the net benefit of hosting S. muscatinei exceeds that of E. marina.},

  abstract = {Background: Reef corals are heterotrophic coelenterates that achieve high productivity through their photosynthetic dinoflagellate symbionts. Excessive seawater temperature destabilises this symbiosis and causes corals to ‘‘bleach,’’ lowering their photosynthetic capacity. Bleaching poses a serious threat to the persistence of coral reefs on a global scale. Despite expanding research on the causes of bleaching, the mechanisms remain a subject of debate. Methodology/Principal Findings: This study determined how light and food availability modulate the effects of temperature stress on photosynthesis in two reef coral species. We quantified the activities of Photosystem II, Photosystem I and whole chain electron transport under combinations of normal and stressful growth temperatures, moderate and high light levels and the presence or absence of feeding of the coral hosts. Our results show that PS1 function is comparatively robust against temperature stress in both species, whereas PS2 and whole chain electron transport are susceptible to temperature stress. In the symbiotic dinoflagellates of Stylophora pistillata the contents of chlorophyll and major photosynthetic complexes were primarily affected by food availability. In Turbinaria reniformis growth temperature was the dominant influence on the contents of the photosynthetic complexes. In both species feeding the host significantly protected photosynthetic function from high temperature stress. Conclusions/Significance: Our findings support the photoinhibition model of coral bleaching and demonstrate that PS1 is not a major site for thermal damage during bleaching events. Feeding mitigates bleaching in two scleractinian corals, so that reef responses to temperature stresses will likely be influenced by the coinciding availabilities of prey for the host.},

Photosynthesis, an interface between non-living matter and living organisms, is very important for both energy flow and material circulation on our planet. Increasing evidence indicates that MNPs can pose direct or indirect stress effects on photoautotrophs, however, our knowledge about them is still limited. The purposes of this mini-review are (1) to review the latest literature of the impacts of MNPs on photosynthesis activities and summarize diverse impacts of MNPs on photosynthesis activities of different photoautotrophs (green plants, microalgae, and cyanobacteria); (2) to discuss the potential action mechanisms in both aquatic and terrestrial environments; and (3) various factors contributing toward these impacts. Additionally, this review provides key future research directions for both researchers and policymakers to better understand and alleviate the environmental impacts of MNPs on our planet.},

The biophysical, computational, and structural description of this process, which started more than 50~years ago, has made tremendous progress over the past two decades, with its high-resolution crystal structures being available not only of the dark-stable state of PSII, but of all the semi-stable reaction intermediates and even some transient states. Here, we summarize the current knowledge on PSII with emphasis on the basic principles that govern the conversion of light energy to chemical energy in PSII, as well as on the illustration of the molecular structures that enable these reactions. The important remaining questions regarding the mechanism of biological water oxidation are highlighted, and one possible pathway for this fundamental reaction is described at a molecular level.},

  abstract = {Plastic pollution is a global threat to marine ecosystems. Plastic litter can leach a variety of substances into marine environments; however, virtually nothing is known regarding how this affects photosynthetic bacteria at the base of the marine food web. To address this, we investigated the effect of plastic leachate exposure on marine Prochlorococcus, widely considered the most abundant photosynthetic organism on Earth and vital contributors to global primary production and carbon cycling. Two strains of Prochlorococcus representing distinct ecotypes were exposed to leachate from common plastic items: high-density polyethylene bags and polyvinyl chloride matting. We show leachate exposure strongly impairs Prochlorococcus in vitro growth and photosynthetic capacity and results in genome-wide transcriptional changes. The strains showed distinct differences in the extent and timing of their response to each leachate. Consequently, plastic leachate exposure could influence marine Prochlorococcus community composition and potentially the broader composition and productivity of ocean phytoplankton communities., Sasha Tetu et al. have examined the effects of plastic leachate exposure on the marine bacteria Prochlorococcus, the most abundant photosynthetic organism on Earth. They find plastic leachates impair growth, photosynthetic capacity and cause global changes in transcription.},

  abstract = {Microplastics are widely distributed in freshwater environments. At present, most of the studies on the toxicity of microplastics are concentrated on aquatic feeding animals, but relatively few have addressed freshwater algae. This study investigated the effect of microplastics (polypropylene (PP) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC)) exposure on the photosynthetic system of freshwater algae over the logarithmic growth period. The results showed that both PVC and PP had a negative effect on chlorophyll a concentrations of Chlorella (C.) pyrenoidosa and Microcystis (M.) flos-aquae; among them, when the concentration of PVC exceeded 250 mg/L, compared with the control group, the chlorophyll a content of C. pyrenoidosa was reduced by 55.23\%. For photosynthetic activity, higher concentrations of PVC and PP can induce lower values of Fv/Fm, Fv/F0, and Fv’/Fm’, suggesting a larger impact in algae. However, algae were able to adjust, with increased values of Fv/Fm, Fv/F0, and Fv’/Fm’. This dose-negative effect phenomenon also exists in the study of the rapid light-response curves. In addition, comparing the two microplastics, we could see that PVC greatly inhibits the photosynthesis system of freshwater algae. Our study confirmed that microplastics can affect algae growth under certain concentrations, which provides evidence for understanding the risks of microplastics.},
