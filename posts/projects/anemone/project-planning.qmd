## Conceptual planning

### Question(s)

::: callout-note Overarching question Does chronic microplastic-associated leachate pollution reduce marine anthozoan's climate resilience to marine heatwaves? :::

2.  ***Photobiology:***

3.  ***Microbiome:*** Does exposure to microplastic-associated leachate pollution disrupt the beneficial function of the anthozoan microbiome community? Is microbial community function disrupted more under added thermal stress?

4.  ***Differential Gene Expression:***

5.  

Hypotheses

Statistical analysis

Sample size

Experimental design

Controlling batch effects or confounding variables

## Permits

Washington Department of Fish & Wildlife scientific collection permit (Tanja 24-010) was submitted on 05-JAN-2024 and the \$117 processing fee was paid from the lab's purchase card over the phone on 08-JAN-2024. WDFW scientific collection permits can take up to 3 months to be approved.
