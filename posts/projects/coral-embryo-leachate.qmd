<div>

This project is a single-stressor ecotoxicology assay experiment conducted in July 2024 at the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology (HIMB) in Kaneohe Bay.

</div>

In this experiment, I track differences in embryonic development of corals exposed to PVC leachate with microscopy and RNAseq gene expression.

The data and code files for this project are organized on GitHub at <https://github.com/sarahtanja/coral-embryo-leachate>
