# Samples

-   1C4F, 2C4F, 3C4F = 123C4

    -   1 min Qiagin Tissue Disruption Tubes

-   1L14F, 2L14F, 3L14F = 123L14

    -   1 min Qiagin Tissue Disruption Tubes

-   1M4F, 2M4F, 3M4F = 123M4

    -   1 min Qiagin Tissue Disruption Tubes

-   1H14F, 2H14F, 3H14F = 123H14

    -   1 min Qiagin Tissue Disruption Tubes

# Summary

::: callout-note
Success! I pooled 3 samples together and this yielded enough RNA!
:::

::: callout-note
I also tested 3 different lysing protocols, and all worked more or less the same. I skipped the Proteinase K digestion as per the 'cells' sample prep instruction in the kit manual. I think I can add this back in if I'm finding protein impurities in the eluted RNA.

# Extraction Notes

date: 13-AUG-2024

kit: Zymo Quick-DNA/RNA Miniprep Plus Kit

-   Thaw samples to room temp

-   Vortex to mix

-   Transfer to Qiagin Tissue Disruption Tube

-   Homogenize for 1 minute

-   Centrifuge at 16,000xg for 1 minute to get rid of bubbles

    -   Checked for complete lysis... still saw entact cells so I homogenized again

-   Honogenized for another 1 minute

-   Split into two aliquots of 700uL & transfer to two new nuclease-free tubes

-   Twizzled 123L14, 123 M4, and 123H14 for extra mechanical lysing

-   Added 700uL of DNA/RNA Lysis Buffer to each tube ( a total of 1400uL volume in each tube )

-   Vortex to mix for 5 seconds

-   Check to see that embryos have dissolved and liquid is clear

    -   123C4, clear

    -   123L14, clear

    -   123M4, cell debris

    -   123H14, clear

---\> Proceed to purification

-   Sequentially transfer 2800uL of each sample in aliquots of 700uL into yellow Spin-Away Filter in a Collection Tube and centrifuge for 30s at 16,000xg **SAVE THE FLOW THROUGH FOR RNA PURIFICATION by tipping flow through into falcon tube**

-   Doubled volume of 100% (200 proof) ethanol to the RNA flow through in a falcon tube and vortexed to mix. End volume of flow through + ethanol = 5mL

-   Sequentially transfer RNA flow-through + ethanol in volumes =\>700uL into the green Zymo Spin IIICG Column in a Collection Tube

-   Saved 1st 1400uL for protein

    ::: callout-warning
    This took 7 passes!
    :::

-   Performed DNase I Treatment on green RNA spin column

    ```{r}
    DB = 75*4
    print(DB)
    Dnase = 5*4 
    print(Dnase)
    ```

    -   I didn't invert to mix... I always lose some volume 'beads' in the lid when I do this. Instead I flicked the tube to mix it and kept all the volume down in the cnical end of the tube. This worked well and I had a full 80uL of treatment per spin column to work with.

-   Warmed Zymo DNase-RNase Free Water to 55C in heat block before elution, and slowly dripped water directly over filter.

eluted DNA volume: 30uL in `Zymo DNase-RNase Free Water`

eluted RNA volume: 30uL in `Zymo DNase-RNase Free Water`

::: callout-warning
123L9 is showing contamination... There is no distinct peak at 260 (like is visible with the other samples).

# Qubit

Using the Invitrogen Thermo Fischer RNA High Sensitivity Assay Kit.

Prepared working solution for 3 samples and two standards:

```{r}
199*6
```

Qubit RNA HS reagent in DMSO = 1uL \* 5 = 6uL

Qubit RNA HS Buffer = 199uL \* 5 = 1194uL

### RNA

standard 1: 91.79

standard 2: calibration error (even after two attempts... I plan to rerun these after getting fresh assay reagents)
