    -   2 min Qiagin Tissue Disruption Tubes

# Summary

::: callout-caution
This extraction was overall bad... The main difference was I re-introduced Proteinase K digestion (hoping to maintain RNA quality & integrity... But RNA quantity suffered A LOT (And I'm not measuring RIN... just crossing my fingers and sending it to Azenta)

# Extraction Notes

date: 15-AUG-2024

kit: Zymo Quick-DNA/RNA Miniprep Plus Kit

-   Thaw samples to room temp

-   Vortex to mix

-   Transfer to Qiagin Tissue Disruption Tube

-   Homogenize for 2 minutes

-   Centrifuge at 16,000xg for 1 minute to get rid of bubbles

    -   Checked for complete lysis... still saw entact cells so I homogenized again for 1 minute with 1/3 of Zymo 0.1 & 0.5 mm glass beads poured in each tube. This resulted in complete lysis. Centrifuged again at 16,000xg for 1 minute

-   Split into two aliquots of 500uL & transfered to two new nuclease-free tubes

-   Proteinase K Digestion

-   Added 700uL of DNA/RNA Lysis Buffer to each tube ( a total of 1400uL volume in each tube )

-   Vortex to mix for 5 seconds

-   Check to see that embryos have dissolved and liquid is clear

    -   123C4, clear

    -   123L14, clear

    -   123M4, cell debris

    -   123H14, clear

---\> Proceed to purification

-   Sequentially transfer 2800uL of each sample in aliquots of 700uL into yellow Spin-Away Filter in a Collection Tube and centrifuge for 30s at 16,000xg **SAVE THE FLOW THROUGH FOR RNA PURIFICATION by tipping flow through into falcon tube**

-   Doubled volume of 100% (200 proof) ethanol to the RNA flow through in a falcon tube and vortexed to mix. End volume of flow through + ethanol = 5mL

-   Sequentially transfer RNA flow-through + ethanol in volumes =\>700uL into the green Zymo Spin IIICG Column in a Collection Tube

-   Saved 1st 1400uL for protein

    ::: callout-warning
    This took 7 passes!
    :::

-   Performed DNase I Treatment on green RNA spin column

    ```{r}
    DB = 75*4
    print(DB)
    Dnase = 5*4 
    print(Dnase)
    ```

    -   I didn't invert to mix... I always lose some volume 'beads' in the lid when I do this. Instead I flicked the tube to mix it and kept all the volume down in the cnical end of the tube. This worked well and I had a full 80uL of treatment per spin column to work with.

-   Warmed Zymo DNase-RNase Free Water to 55C in heat block before elution, and slowly dripped water directly over filter.

eluted DNA volume: 30uL in `Zymo DNase-RNase Free Water`

eluted RNA volume: 30uL in `Zymo DNase-RNase Free Water`

::: callout-warning
123L9 is showing contamination... There is no distinct peak at 260 (like is visible with the other samples).

# Qubit

Using the Invitrogen Thermo Fischer RNA High Sensitivity Assay Kit.

Prepared working solution for 3 samples and two standards:

```{r}
199*6
```

Qubit RNA HS reagent in DMSO = 1uL \* 5 = 6uL

Qubit RNA HS Buffer = 199uL \* 5 = 1194uL

### RNA

standard 1: 91.79

standard 2: calibration error (even after two attempts... I plan to rerun these after getting fresh assay reagents)
