# Extraction Notes

kit: Zymo Quick-DNA/RNA Miniprep Plus Kit

-   Thaw samples to room temp

-   Transfer and pool samples to one Zymo BashingBead Tube

    -   89C14 I 'topped up' with DNA/RNA Shield so that it had 1.5mL volume same as the other samples

-   Homogenize for 10 minutes

    -   10 min Zymo BashingBead Tube

        -   The 4hpf samples are hardier and take a little longer to lyse than the other embryonic phases

-   Centrifuge at 14800rpm/16,162xg for 1 min to get rid of bubbles

    -   Check for complete lysis of embryos
    -   Supernatent is clear!

-   Transfer 2 550uL aliquots of cleared supernatent to one new nuclease-free tube

-   Centrifuge at 16,000xg for 1 min to pellet any beads

-   Split cleared supernatent into two aliquots of 530uL & transfer each aliquot to a new nuclease-free tube

-   Add 530uL of DNA/RNA Lysis Buffer to each tube ( a total of 1060uL volume in each tube )

-   Vortex to mix for 5 seconds

    ---\> Proceed to purification

-   Sequentially transfer each sample in aliquots of 700uL into yellow Spin-Away Filter in a Collection Tube and centrifuge for 30s at 16,000xg **SAVE THE FLOW THROUGH FOR RNA PURIFICATION by tipping flow through into spare collection tube (15mL Falcon Tube). This will take 3 passes.**

-   Doubled volume of 100% (200 proof) ethanol to the RNA flow through in a falcon tube and vortexed to mix. End volume of flow through 2.1mL + ethanol 2.1mL = 4.2mL

-   Sequentially transfer RNA flow-through + ethanol in volumes =\>700uL into the green Zymo Spin IIICG Column in a Collection Tube. This should take 6 'spins'

-   Saved 1st 2 spins (1400uL) for protein tube. Once collected place in -20 freezer.

-   Performed DNase I Treatment on green RNA spin column

-   ::: callout-warning
    Forgot to do DNA/RNA Wash 400uL prior to DNase Treatment :(
    :::

    ```{r}
    DB = 75*10
    print(DB)
    Dnase = 5*10 
    print(Dnase)
    ```

::: callout-note
```         
    I didn't invert to mix... I always lose some volume 'beads' in the lid when I do this. Instead I flicked the tube to mix it and kept all the volume down in the conical end of the tube. This worked well and I had a full 80uL of treatment per spin column to work with!
```
:::

-   400uL of Prep Buffer
-   700uL of DNA/RNA Wash Buffer
-   400uL of DNA/RNA Wash Buffer, 2min
-   Centrifuge 2min dry run
-   Warmed Zymo DNase-RNase Free Water to 55C in heat block before elution, and slowly dripped 50uL of water directly over filter.

# End Products

eluted DNA volume: 50uL in `Zymo DNase-RNase Free Water`

eluted RNA volume: 50uL in warmed (55C) `Zymo DNase-RNase Free Water`

::: callout-important
I upped the elution volume from 30 to 50 for RNA because I wanted to make sure the nuclease-free water volume was enough to saturate the whole filter and get the RNA from it... The minimum volume in the kit instructions is 50uL... And I do have an RNA Clean & Concentrator kit that allows me to reduce that if needed. As long as total RNA is at least 100ng, we're good. That means that qubit value (ng/uL) times the elution volume.

# Qubit QAQC

Using the Invitrogen Thermo Fischer RNA High Sensitivity Assay Kit.

Prepared working solution for 6 samples and two standards (plus some extra) in a 5mL tube:

```{r}
buffer <- 199*15
print(buffer)
reagent <- 1*15
print(reagent)
```

### RNA

standard 1: 94.53

standard 2: 1590.87

RunID: 2024-08-22_062101[^2]

[^2]: The Qubit date is ahead by 1 day (and I haven't figured out how to set it straight yet)
