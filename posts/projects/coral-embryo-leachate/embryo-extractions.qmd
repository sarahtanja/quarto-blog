::: {callout-important appearance="simple"} GOAL: To extract RNA for 180 samples of *Montipora capitata* embryos for total RNAseq. :::

Checkout M.E. Schedl's [DNA/RNA Extraction Protocol for Coral Larvae](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/Larvae-Ex-Protocol/)

This protocol follows the Zymo Research [*Quick*-DNA/RNA Mininprep Plus Kit Instruction Manual](https://files.zymoresearch.com/protocols/_d7003t_d7003_quick-dna-rna_miniprep_plus_kit.pdf), and will result in DNA, RNA, (and if desired, proteins for metabolomics) for each sample. This facilitates paired sample analysis, where each data point in one dataset is uniquely paired to a data point in the second dataset because we are making duplicate measurements on the *same sample*.

However, DNA and proteins for metabolomics are NOT the focus here. Those samples will be saved for potential future work... but HERE, we are focusing on RNA!

# Biological Sample Info

The samples I am working with are frozen *Montipora capitata* coral embryos held at -80¬∞C, with `Zymo DNA/RNA Shield`, in 0.5mL screw-cap cryovials. The samples are representative of 3 distinct phases of embryonic development: 1. Initial cleavage, or 4 hours post fertilization 2. Prawn chip, or 9 hours post fertilization 3. Early gastrula, or 14 hours post fertilization

They have been exposed to either a filtered-seawater control or PVC leachate concentrations (Low 0.01mg/L, Mid 0.1mg/L, High 1mg/L) through bundle-bundle cross fertilization in 20mL scintillation vials, and left to incubate and develop according to the above cutoffs.

**The qubit tube should only be labelled on the top; the sides should be clear so that the qubit fluorescence can be read without impedance.**
:::

The intermediate tubes and qubit tubes can just be labelled with the `sample_id`, and whether they are RNA or DNA products such as: `1M4F DNA` or `1M4F RNA`

Any tubes that will be kept should be labelled with `sample_id`, `DNA/RNA`, `date (ddMMMyy)`, & `initials`, such as:

# Prepare Buffers

-   [ ] If using the 50-prep kit (D7003), add `96 ml 100% ethanol (104 ml 95% ethanol)` to the 24 ml DNA/RNA Wash Buffer concentrate.

    ‚Äã *If using the 10-prep kit, DNA/RNA Wash Buffer (D7003T) is supplied ready-to-use and does not require the addition of ethanol.*

-   [ ] Reconstitute `lyophilized DNase I` with `DNase/RNase-Free Water` and mix by gentle inversion. Use immediately or store frozen aliquots.

    -   [ ] 50-prep, add 275 ¬µl water
    -   [ ] 10-prep, add 55 ¬µl water

-   [ ] Reconstitute `lyophilized Proteinase K` at 20 mg/ml with `Proteinase K Storage Buffer` and mix by vortexing. Use immediately or store frozen aliquots.

    -   [ ] 50-prep, (60 mg), add 3.12 ml buffer
    -   [ ] 10-prep, (5 mg), add 0.26 ml (260 ul) buffer

-   [ ] To prepare a 1X solution of `DNA/RNA Shield‚Ñ¢`, add an equal volume (5mL for the whole solution) of `nuclease-free water` (not provided) to the `DNA/RNA Shield‚Ñ¢` (2X concentrate) (1:1) and mix with a quick pulse on the vortexer.

# Lyse: Bead-Bash Samples

-   Wait for samples to fully thaw on ice. Samples are already stored in \~500uL of Zymo DNA/RNA Shield
-   Use a P-1000 to transfer all of the sample to each respective 2mL (0.1 - 0.5mm) bead-bashing tube
-   Add another 700uL of Zymo DNA/RNA Shield for a total liquid volume of 1.2mL
-   Set bead-bashing tubes in Mortexer and homogenize at high speed for **40 minutes**

::: column-margin
> "A minimum of 800 ¬µl of liquid volume is what we typically recommend when working with the BashingBead Tubes. This is because anything lower may lead to inefficient bead movement during shaking, oversaturation of content, and difficulties when transferring sample from the tube without disturbing the debris. All of these can lead to impurity by precipitation/clogging in the columns."
:::

# Proteinase-K Digestion

-   Get the Proteinase K out of the -20 freezer & set the heat-block to warm up to 55C for 30mins

-   After bead bashing, tubes are ['intensely bubbly'](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/Larvae-Ex-Protocol/#:~:text=Tubes%20after%20vortexing%20are%20intensely%20bubbly), to tamp down bubbles, centrifuge in the mini-centrifuge for 1min

-   Transfer 500uL of supernatent to a new nuclease-free tube, making sure not to disturb beads and debris at the bottom of the bead-bashing tube[^2]

-   Add Proteinase K & Buffer

    -   Add the appropriate volume of Pro K buffer and Proteinase K (Proteinase K is stored in the -20 after being reconstituted)

    -   (10:1 ratio of sample:digestion buffer) & (2:1 ratio of digestion buffer:Proteinase K)

    -   For tubes with approximately 500uL of sample add:

        -   50ul pro K buffer
        -   25ul proteinase K

-   Vortex to mix

-   Incubate in the heat-block for 30mins at 55C

-   Vortex to mix & centrifuge on max for 2mins to pellet any debris

-   Transfer 350uL of the cleared supernatent to a new 1.5mL nuclease-free tube, making sure not to disturb any debris at the bottom of the tube

-   Add 350uL of **DNA/RNA Lysis Buffer** to the supernatent(1:1) and vortex to mix

[^2]: Why do we transfer from the bead-bashing tube to two different nuclease-free tubes in this step? Jerry Yu from Zymo says:

    > "We are worried about the sample debris remaining in the tube, which should still contain protein. One of the reasons for Proteinase K treatment at this step is to break down protein in the solution to make it less viscous/sticky, so the column can process it without issue. By transferring the mixture out, the treatment could be more efficient."
    
# Purify DNA & RNA

Transfer the buffered supernatent (should be a total of 700uL, which can be passed through the filter in one go) to yellow **`Spin-Away Filter`** in a **`Collection Tube`** and centrifuge at 16,000xg for 30 sec

::: {.callout-warning appearance="simple"}
Save The flow-through in the collection tube for RNA purification! At this step the DNA is in the yellow spin column filter and the RNA is in the flow through.
:::

Transfer the yellow **`Spin-Away Filter`** to a new **`Collection Tube`**

-   To the RNA flow-through, add 700uL (1:1) of 200-proof ethanol to the flow-through and mix by pipetting up and down 12 times

-   The RNA+ethanol volume is now 1,400uL. In aliquots up to 700uL, transfer the RNA sample to the green **`Zymo-Spin IIICG Column`** in a **`Collection Tube`**, centrifuge, and discard the flow-through. Dab the rim of the collection tube with a Kim Wipe to clean off any residual flow-through. This step binds the RNA to the green column filter. Repeat until all RNA Sample has passed through the filter.

> #### DNase 1 Treatment for RNA
>
> -   Add 400uL **`DNA/RNA Wash Buffer`** to the `green Zymo-Spin IIICG Column`, centrifuge and discard the flow-through
>
> -   For each sample to be treated, prepare **`DNase 1 Reaction Mix`**: $$
>     DNase\, 1\, volume = 5 \mu L * (no.\, of\, sample\, preps)
>     $$ $$
>     DNA\, Digestion\, Buffer\, volume  = 75 \mu L * (no.\, of\, sample\, preps)
>     $$
>
> -   Add 75uL of **`DNA Digestion Buffer`** per prep to a new nuclease-free tube
>
> -   Add 5uL of reconstituted **`DNase 1`** (thawed if previously frozen at -20C) per sample prep to the nuclease-free tube
>
> -   Mix by gentle inversion
>
> -   Carefully drip 80uL of **`DNase 1 Reaction Mix`** directly onto the `green Zymo-Spin IIICG Column` filter and let incubate at room temperature for **15mins**

### Wash & Elute

-   Add 400uL **`DNA/RNA Prep Buffer`** to each column and centrifuge at 16,000xg for 30s, then discard the flow-through

-   Add 700uL of **`DNA/RNA Wash Buffer`** [^7]to each column and centrifuge at 16,000xg for 30s, then discard the flow-through

-   Add 400uL of **`DNA/RNA Wash Buffer`** to each column and centrifuge at 16,000xg for 2mins to ensure complete removal of the wash buffer, then discard the flow-through

-   Conduct a dry spin and centrifuge at 16,000xg for 2mins to ensure complete removal of the wash buffer prior to elution[^8]

-   Carefully transfer the column into the nuclease-free tube labelled for containing the eluted DNA/RNA end products

-   Add 70uL **`DNase/RNase-Free Water`** directly to the column matrix and centrifuge at 16,000xg for 30s

-   Place eluted DNA/RNA tubes on ice to continue work, or store in the -80C freezer for later

[^7]: Slowly dispense wash buffer along the sides of the filter like pouring a heady beer down the side of a pint glass. Jerry Yu from Zymo says:

    > "You are correct with the beer analogy. By slowly dispensing wash buffer along the inner radius of the column, you can rinse off salts/residuals from previous spins, so future spins will be cleaner."

[^8]: Another tip from Zymo:

    > The goal of rinsing and reducing the volume of wash buffer is to avoid residual buffer from previous washes to end up in the elution, which will reduce purity. If volume of the wash buffer is increased in the final wash step, make sure to also increase the centrifugation time (e.g., 2 minutes) or include a second spin without buffer (dry spin) to ensure complete removal of the buffer prior to elution.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## RNA Clean-up

### RNA Clean & Concentrator-5

-   Open the **`RNA Clean & Concentrator-5`** kit

-   Add 140uL of **`RNA Binding Buffer`** to each 70uL of eluted RNA sample (2:1, **`RNA Binding Buffer`**:eluted RNA sample)

-   Add 210uL (140+70) of 99.5% (200 proof) molecular-grade ethanol (1:1, **`RNA Binding Buffer`**+eluted RNA sample: ethanol) to each tube

-   Transfer the sample to the `Zymo-Spin IC Column` in a `Collection Tube` and centrifuge at 16,000xg for 30sec

-   Discard the flow through, pat the collection tube dry with a clean kim wipe

-   Add 400uL **`RNA Prep Buffer`** to each column and centrifuge at 16,000xg for 30s, then discard the flow-through

-   Add 700uL of **`RNA Wash Buffer`** to each column and centrifuge at 16,000xg for 30s, then discard the flow-through

-   Add 400uL of **`RNA Wash Buffer`** to each column and centrifuge at 16,000xg for 2mins to ensure complete removal of the wash buffer, then discard the flow-through

-   Conduct a dry spin and centrifuge at 16,000xg for 2mins to ensure complete removal of the wash buffer prior to elution

# Qubit Prep

-   Transfer 1uL of each eluted & purified DNA/RNA sample to their respectively labelled Qubit assay tube, and keep on ice to continue work, or freeze in the -80C for later
