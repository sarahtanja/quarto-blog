# Samples

-   6C14F (single sample \~10 embryos)

-   7C14F (single sample \~10 embryos)

-   6C9F, 7C9F = 67C9F (pooled sample. \~20 embryos)

# Summary

No success with RNA quantity as measured by Nanodrop or Broad Range Qubit Assay.

I think I should increase starting sample size, and look into alternative sample prep for delicate embryos (as compared with adult coral fragments).

I can't be sure that waiting too long during the DNase Treatment didn't degrade all the RNA, next round be careful not to go over the 15 minute DNase I incubation time.

# Extraction Notes

date: 12-AUG-2024

kit: Zymo Quick-DNA/RNA Miniprep Plus Kit

Followed protocol according to my post \[M. Capitata Embryo DNA/RNA Extractions Protocol\] (https://sarahtanja.github.io/quarto-blog/posts/projects/coral-embryo-leachate/embryo-extractions.html#proteinase-k-digestion) with these changes:

-   Lysed samples via Bead Bashing in a full 2mL Zymo BeadBashing (0.1 - 0.5mm glass bead) Tube with a total volume of 1mL of DNA/RNA Shield

-   Transfered 500uL of cleared supernatent to a new nuclease-free tube, making sure not to disturb beads and debris at the bottom of the bead-bashing tube

-   Conducted Proteinase K digestion as follows:

    -   Get the Proteinase K out of the -20 freezer & set the heat-block to warm up to 55C for 30mins

    -   After bead bashing, tubes are ‘intensely bubbly’, to tamp down bubbles, centrifuge in the mini-centrifuge for 1min

    -   Transfer 500uL of supernatent to a new nuclease-free tube, making sure not to disturb beads and debris at the bottom of the bead-bashing tube2

    -   Add Proteinase K & Buffer

    -   Add the appropriate volume of Pro K buffer and Proteinase K (Proteinase K is stored in the -20 after being reconstituted)

    -   (10:1 ratio of sample:digestion buffer) & (2:1 ratio of digestion buffer:Proteinase K)

    -   For tubes with approximately 500uL of sample add:

    -   50ul pro K buffer 25ul proteinase K Vortex to mix

    -   Incubate in the heat-block for 30mins at 55C

    -   Vortex to mix & centrifuge on max for 2mins to pellet any debris

    -   Transfer 350uL of the cleared supernatent to a new 1.5mL nuclease-free tube, making sure not to disturb any debris at the bottom of the tube

    -   Add 350uL of DNA/RNA Lysis Buffer to the supernatent(1:1) and vortex to mix

-   I let DNase I treatment incubate at room temperature for 1 hour (instead of 15 minutes)

# Qubit

## RNA

Using the Invitrogen Thermo Fischer RNA Broad Range Assay Kit.

Prepared working solution for 3 samples and two standards:

Qubit RNA BR reagent in DMSO = 1uL \* 5 = 5uL

Qubit RNA BR Buffer = 199uL \* 5 = 995uL

# Storage Location

RNA samples are stored in -80C 'Old Friedman' Sanyo freezer on shelf 1 in `coral-embryo-leachate RNA` wax freezer boxes with green label tape.

DNA samples (not quantified) are stored in -20C in JPG Lab FSH 236 in shelf 2 in `coral-embryo-leachate DNA` wax freezer box with yellow label tape.

Protein flow-through (not quantified) are stored in -20C in JPG Lab FSH 236 in shelf 2 in `coral-embryo-leachate PROTEIN` wax freezer box with blue label tape.
