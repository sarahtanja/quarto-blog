Dana, J.D. (1846a). Zoophytes, in United States Exploring Expedition. During the years 1838, 1839, 1840, 1841, 1842. Under the command of Charles Wilkes, U.S.N. (Philadelphia: Lea and Blanchard), 7:1-740. (For species details see pp. 504-505 and Plate 47, Fig. 4)

Described also in 1989 in @veron1989 from type specimens collected on reefs in the Philippines.

Their life history is described as a 'complex coral' which forms two germ layers from a 'prawn chip' and becomes a spherical 'gastrula' with a visible 'blastopore'[@okub02013].
