This project is a multiple-stressor experiment conducted in July 2024 at the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology (HIMB) in Kaneohe Bay.

</div>

In this experiment, I exposed a total of 60 coral nubbins to PVC leachate and thermal stress for 96 hours. I measured the performance of the coral symbionts' photosynthetic efficiency (Fv/Fm), and non-photochemical quenching (via quasi dark-adapted rapid light curves) daily with the Walz Diving PAM II during the exposure. At the end of the 96 hour exposure, I flash-froze whole nubbins in liquid nitrogen to conduct RNAseq analysis of the symbiont's gene expression.

The data and code files for this project are organized on GitHub at <https://github.com/sarahtanja/coral-leachate-heat>
