  abstract = {Microplastics are anthropogenic contaminants found in coastal and marine environments worldwide. Pacific razor clams (Siliqua patula), important for local indigenous culture, economy, gastronomy and food security along the United States West Coast, are subjected to myriad environmental stressors including predation, storm events, disease, toxins, and microplastics. This study aimed to determine microplastic burdens in Olympic Coast, Washington Pacific razor clams and estimate annual microplastic exposure of recreational razor clam harvester-consumers from eating this species. We quantified suspected microplastic burdens in Pacific razor clams collected from eight tribal, recreational, and commercial harvest areas on the Olympic Coast in April 2018. We administered questionnaires to 107 recreational razor clam harvesters during the same timeframe to determine consumption patterns, preparation styles, knowledge and concerns about microplastics, and demographics. Razor clams containing suspected microplastics, primarily microfibers, were found at all eight sites. Average suspected microplastic burden differed by sample type (whole= 6.75 ± 0.60, gut-tissue= 7.88 ± 0.71, non-gut tissue= 4.96 ± 0.56, and cleaned samples= 3.44 ± 0.25). FTIR analyses of a random subset of microfibers in whole and cleaned clams indicated material types of polyethylene terephthalate, cellulose acetate, cellophane, polyester, nylon, and cellulose. The average number of razor clams consumed per meal by Olympic Coast recreational razor clam harvesters was 4.27 ± 0.27, which varied by gender and ethnicity, but not income or age. Harvesters ate 0–209 meals/year of razor clams (16.2\% harvested but did not eat razor clams), and most respondents (88.3\%) fully cleaned razor clams before consuming them. Annual suspected microplastic exposure for razor clam harvester-consumers was 60–3,070 pieces for cleaned and 120–6,020 for whole clams. Our findings suggest Olympic Coast recreational razor clam harvester-consumers are exposed to low levels of microplastics from eating razor clams. Microplastic exposure can be reduced by roughly 50\% if clams are cleaned before consumption. Our work serves as an important reference in the growing portfolio of Pacific Northwest microplastic research, to inform future microplastic attenuation recommendations and development of human health standards for this type of pollution.},

Microplastics (0.3-5 mm in size) are of most concern because they cannot be easily spotted, last the longest, and are easily ingested by marine organisms and make their way through the food chain. This study examines the distribution of microplastics found on Seattle beaches and on beaches to the north and south of the city. I collected sediment from three 1 m2 quadrats on each beach of my 12 sample sites using the Beach Sampling Protocol from the Port Townsend Marine Science Center to ensure comparison of data with other studies. The results show a total of 1,776 microplastic pieces/m2 collected at all twelve beaches, with a weak connection between spatial distribution and population density of nearby cities. As beaches erode, these microplastics are transported into Puget Sound and the Pacific Ocean. It remains an open question of how many and how much of these microplastic particles are exported from the beaches into the ocean.},

  abstract = {Plastic material is the most prominent constituent of pollution in the marine environment and it  has a myriad of adverse consequences. This research investigates the contribution of  microplastics to Puget Sound, Washington, via the Puyallup River from 2017 to 2018. Datasets  from UW Tacoma were analyzed to determine spatial and temporal variation of microplastic  abundance across nine sampling stations. The stations were located around the Puyallup River’s  nearby wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) as these plants act as possible sources of pollution.  A majority of the data indicated that microplastic abundance increased from 2017 to 2018  (P = 0.0287). Additionally, the data demonstrated a positive correlation between average  microplastic abundance per city and total population both years (2017 R2 = 0.8749,  2018 R2 = 0.6195). Although spatial results were variable, abundance increased in the Puyallup  River between the two sites closest to Puget Sound. 2018 data had a larger microplastic type  distribution than 2017 with 63 percent fiber and 37 percent fragment, while 2017 only had fibers.  Puyallup River results were compared to a study conducted on the Snohomish River in 2017.  Mean river microplastic abundance between the two sites showed no difference in 2017  (P = 0.0549) and a significant difference in 2018 (P = 0.0008). Regulations on anthropogenic  related pollution are necessary as microplastics continue to accumulate in the ocean. Further  research with larger datasets and over longer timescales is crucial for resolving variability in the  data and determining the impact plastic pollution has on marine communities.},

Macro-plastics (larger than 5 mm) and their effects on marine life have been well studied, documenting effects such as strangulation and digestive blockage in animals. Micro-plastics (0.3 mm to 5 mm in size), a result of either plastic produced in small pieces or fragmentation, have only recently begun being researched. This study characterizes macro and micro plastics in two NE Pacific estuaries, Puget Sound, WA and Nootka Sound, Canada. Macro-plastic concentrations were zero at all stations in both estuaries. Average micro-plastic concentrations at the surface ranged from 0 pieces/m3 to 102 pieces/m3, 5 m depth concentrations were 0 pieces/m3 to 44 pieces/m3 and 10 m depth concentrations were 0 pieces/m3 to 5300 pieces/m3. Fibers of plastic, assumed to be primarily marine in origin, had a higher concentration at most stations than those in pellet form, assumed to be terrestrial in origin. Understanding plastics’ distribution, origins, and effects on estuaries will require significant spatial and temporal sampling, beginning at the source.},

  abstract = {Microplastics (plastic {$<$} 5mm) are ubiquitous in marine environments, from surface waters to benthic sediments. Microplastic in the oceans was first documented in 2004 and our current knowledge of potential biological implications is limited and rapidly growing. Thus far, we know marine organisms are exposed to microplastics in natural settings, ingest microplastics, and experience negative physiological impacts. Many aspects of microplastics such as ingestion fate, extent of trophic transfer, and effect on marine ecosystems remain unknown. Motivated by the need to understand the impact microplastic pollution has on our environment and our lives, I investigated three aspects of the marine microplastic problem: impacts on marine organisms, the ecosystem they support, and the linkages between scientific research and public policy. 	In nature, mussels experience a wide range of particle types and concentrations, readily filtering microalgae and abiotic particles other than microplastic. Mussel clearance rate is sensitive to stress, making it a good indicator of stressful conditions and polluted environments. In Chapter 1, I compare mussel (Mytilus trossulus) clearance rates when exposed to two different abiotic particles, microplastic and silt, across multiple concentrations. I measure the clearance rates of mussels exposed to increasing concentrations of three particle treatments: Algae, microplastic + algae, and silt + algae. I found that mussel clearance rate was inhibited by high concentrations of microplastics but not silt. In the absence of microplastic, mussel clearance rate was not dependent on the addition of silt, total particle concentration, or algal concentration.  	Mussels readily ingest microplastics in natural and laboratory settings, raising concerns about particle fate. Mussels are key benthic-pelagic couplers, concentrating particles from the water column into dense and nutrient rich biodeposits. In Chapter 2, I evaluate how microplastic changes the benthic-pelagic coupling role of marine mussels (M. trossulus). I expose mussels to feeding regimes with and without microplastic and measure four attributes of biodeposits: morphology, quantity of algal and microplastic particles, sinking rate, and resuspension velocity. I found biodeposits from the algae treatment contained more algal cells on average than those from the microplastic treatment. Further, biodeposits from the microplastic treatment sank slower and resuspended at slower water velocities than biodeposits from the algae treatment.    	To combat plastic pollution, there is sufficient evidence that policies can lead to reduced plastic production and consumption both locally and globally. In Chapter 3, I examine global growth and spread of the marine microplastic field in conjunction with growth and spread of national plastic policies using scientometric and diffusion methods. I conduct systematic literature reviews of marine microplastic papers and national plastic policies through 2019. At a global level, marine microplastic research and national plastic policies have grown exponentially and remain in the early phases of growth and spatial diffusion. Marine microplastic publication spread at the institution level was best explained by a hybrid of expansion and relocation diffusion, while national plastic policy spread was best explained by expansion diffusion.  	Taken together, findings from Chapters 1 and 2 indicate mussels readily filter, ingest, and egest microplastics, demonstrating their ability to transport particles between benthic and pelagic habitats. When exposed to microplastics, decreased clearance rate may result in fewer particles removed from the water column and subsequently available to benthic organisms. Further, decreases in sinking rate and resuspension velocity of biodeposits containing microplastic may increase dispersal distances, thus leading to increased transport of both algal cells and microplastic particles away from mussel beds. While extent of marine microplastic research is not a good indicator of national plastic policies, both the scientific field and national efforts to reduce plastic pollution are spreading globally at exponential rates. Marine microplastic pollution is a local, regional, and global issue that require cross disciplinary attention from researchers and policy makers around the world.},

  abstract = {Anthropogenic debris including microparticles ({$<$}5 mm) are ubiquitous in marine environments. The Salish Sea experiences seasonal fluctuations in precipitation, river discharge, sewage overflow events, and tourism—all variables previously thought to have an impact on microparticle transport and concentrations. Our goals are two-fold: 1) describe long-term microparticle contamination data including concentration, type, and size; and 2) determine if seasonal microparticle concentrations are dependent on environmental or tourism variables in Elliott Bay, Salish Sea. We sampled 100 L of seawater at a depth of approximately 9 m at the Seattle Aquarium, Seattle, Washington State, United States, approximately every two weeks from 2019 through 2020 and used an oil extraction protocol to separate microparticles. We found that microparticle concentrations ranged from 0 to 0.64 particles L−1 and fibers were the most common type observed. Microparticle concentrations exhibited a breakpoint on 10 April 2020, where estimated slope and associated microparticle concentration significantly declined. Further, when considering both environmental as well as tourism variables, temporal microparticle concentration was best described by a mixed-effects model, with tourism as the fixed effect and the person counting microparticles as the random effect. Although monitoring efforts presented set out to identify effects of seasonality and interannual differences in microparticle concentrations, it instead captured an effect of decreased tourism due to the global Covid-19 pandemic. Long-term monitoring is critical to establish temporal microparticle concentrations and to help researchers understand if there are certain events, both seasonal and sporadic (e.g., rain events, tourism, or global pandemics), when the marine environment is more at risk from anthropogenic pollution.

We quantified the number of microfibres found in the stomachs of 734 sand lance and 205 herring that had been captured by an abundant seabird, the rhinoceros auklet (Cerorhinca monocerata). Sampling took place on six widely-dispersed breeding colonies in British Columbia, Canada, and Washington State, USA, over one to eight years. The North Pacific Ocean is a global hotspot for pollution, yet few sand lance (1.5\%) or herring (2.0\%) had ingested microfibres. In addition, there was no systematic relationship between the prevalence of microplastics in the fish stomachs vs. in waters around three of our study colonies (measured in an earlier study). Sampling at a single site (Protection Island, WA) in a single year (2016) yielded most (sand lance) or all (herring) of the microfibres recovered over the 30 colony-years of sampling involved in this study, yet no microfibres had been recovered there, in either species, in the previous year. We thus found no evidence that sand lance and herring currently act as major food-web conduits for microfibres along British Columbia's outer coast, nor that the local at-sea density of plastic necessarily determines how much plastic enters marine food webs via zooplanktivores. Extensive urban development around the Salish Sea probably explains the elevated microfibre loads in fishes collected on Protection Island, but we cannot account for the between-year variation. Nonetheless, the existence of such marked interannual variation indicates the importance of measuring year-to-year variation in microfibre pollution both at sea and in marine biota.},

  abstract = {The world’s reliance on plastic is a contemporary dependence as its malleable function, low production cost, and increasing abundance has been universally favored over all other products. Created with the intention of short-term and one-time use, the global production of plastic reached 299 million tonnes in 2013, with 10-20 million tonnes ending up in the oceans annually. This study explores the contribution of microplastics to the marine environment from river systems, and quantifies the microplastic load within a stream as it passes from rural to urban environments. The sampled river is fed by a remote, glacially fed lake in the Cascadia Mountain Range, flowing into the upper Skykomish River, the Snohomish River, and eventually to the Puget Sound. Samples were collected by towing a 335 μm mesh manta trawl during an ebb tide and analyzed, after a wet peroxide oxidation and density separation, to quantify the concentration of microplastics present in the stream. From the 16 samples analyzed, a trend has been found between the quantity of plastics in the stream and the streams proximity to the headwaters. This trend implies that the growing quantity of microplastics within the stream, as it flows from rural to urban environments, is supplied through anthropogenic influences. This study has found 0.12 tonnes of microplastics are transported every year by this river system, equating to 1.2 x 109 pieces of microplastics. Following this study, microplastic pollution can no longer be thought of as a coastal and marine issue, but rather a problem that starts much further inland.},

Microplastics were visually observed in all samples collected and the samples were quantified to  concentrations at each depth. The highest microplastic concentration - 1.88x10 -4 g/m 3 - was  found in Possession Sound while the most consistent vertical profile was found at Seabeck in  Hood Canal, suggesting residence time is more likely a driving factor to vertical distribution than  proximity to population centers.

  abstract = {Shellfish aquaculture in the Salish Sea (encompassing the Strait of Juan de Fuca, Puget Sound, and the Georgia Strait) is a major source of clams, oysters, and mussels in the United States and Canada. Plastic gear is necessary for the viability of many of these operations. During the past few years, shellfish farm permits issued in Washington State have been challenged on various bases that have included allegations that the plastic gear is releasing microplastics, commonly defined as particles less than 5 mm in diameter. Published survey data on sources of marine plastic debris demonstrate the very limited contribution of aquaculture gear. Both permits and industry codes of practice provide procedures to minimize loss of gear to the marine environment. Plastic gear is also designed specifically to maintain its integrity and not degrade in the marine environment. Plastic degradation is greatest on beaches with high UV exposure, whereas aquaculture gear is mostly underwater and/or covered by biofoulants. Available data for microplastics in water, sediment, and biota of the Salish Sea do not suggest significant release of microplastics from shellfish aquaculture operations.

  abstract = {Microplastic pollution in the ocean is caused by the human population, and the way it  transports throughout the water can be affected by numerous factors such as wind, tides, and  residence times of the water. Microplastic concentrations were determined through sampling in  multiple areas throughout Puget Sound: Admiralty Inlet, Hood Canal, Whidbey Basin, and the  central basin during December 2017 and January 2018. The microplastic concentrations were  compared to the multiple factors that could affect concentration (wind, tides, residence times and  human population), and the concentrations were correlated with human population the most, out  of all the other factors. This study can be used to help understand how plastic is distributed  throughout Puget Sound, to help facilitate more efficient clean-ups in the area.},

  abstract = {[author abstract]  The study of microplastic pollution is relatively new in the science of oceanography, with the first paper published in 1972. Since then, many papers have been written in attempts to gain a better understanding of how and where these plastics congregate in the world’s oceans, and what issues arise in turn. Succinctly, this problem is ubiquitous and openly threatens all marine biota. This paper examines the link between higher concentrations of plastics with anthropogenically active and highly populated regions. Six stations were sampled for surface plastics in Puget Sound, starting near Seattle, WA and ending in the open waters outside of Nootka Sound, Canada. A modified Manta net was deployed at each station. The samples were sieved, the plastic pieces picked out under a microscope, counted, and placed into labelled sample jars. Analysis showed higher concentrations were found within Puget Sound, and lower concentrations in the open ocean. A spike towards the high concentration end was also measured near Victoria, B.C. This study furthers the continuous realization that our ocean waters are accumulating plastic pollution, and the largest concentrations are found in waters adjacent to large populations of people and industrial activity.},
