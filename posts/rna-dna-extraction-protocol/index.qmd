The aim of this protocol is to take coral fragments that have been snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and extract both DNA for downstream archaea & bacteria microbiome 16S Microbiome Sequencing and RNA for downstream coral-host tissue Tag-seq or RNA-seq analysis.

> In plain, I want to answer 'who is there?' regarding the bacterial community, and 'what is the coral doing?' regarding gene expression.

The benefits of doing DNA and RNA extraction together are that it saves time, money, & sample material. It also facilitates paired sample analysis, where each data point in one dataset is uniquely paired to a data point in the second dataset because we are making duplicate measurements on the *same sample*.

The challenge is lysing the sample enough to get the bacterial DNA (busting open all those layers of cell membranes!) and retaining host (coral) RNA integrity.

This protocol follows the Zymo Research [*Quick*-DNA/RNA Mininprep Plus Kit Instruction Manual](https://files.zymoresearch.com/protocols/_d7003t_d7003_quick-dna-rna_miniprep_plus_kit.pdf) with help and optimization from URI Putnam Lab Members Open Lab Notebook posts; such as Emma Strand's notebook post on [Zymo-Duet-RNA-DNA-Extraction-Protocol](https://emmastrand.github.io/EmmaStrand_Notebook/Zymo-Duet-RNA-DNA-Extraction-Protocol/), Kevin Wong's post on [Porites Extractions](https://kevinhwong1.github.io/KevinHWong_Notebook/20201027-DNA-RNA-Extractions-Porites-July-Bleaching-Experiment) and M.E. Schedl's post on [Porites Extractions](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/porites-zymo-rna/), as well as suggestions from a Zymo tech on [March 28th 2023](https://sarahtanja.github.io/lab-book/blog/daily-log/#28-mar-2023-t) regarding [optimized lysis protocols](https://files.zymoresearch.com/documents/bead_beating_short_protocol_tables.pdf) and suggestions from a Zymo tech on May 15th 2023 regarding optimized Proteinase K digestion temperature.

### Randomize Sample Processing

Make sure to randomize which samples are processed in each batch of extractions to reduce 'batch effects'!

See ['Randomize Sample Processing'](https://github.com/sarahtanja/coral-DNA-RNA-lab-extractions/blob/main/rand-sample-processing.Rmd) script for how I randomized sample processing.

::: callout-tip
Think about how many samples you can process at once, and your kit, centrifuge, and homogenizer capacity.

### Arrange Lab Bench + Tubes

This extraction protocol can be split into two main phases: **Lysing** and **Purification**.

**Lysing Station**

-   liquid nitrogen dewer
-   dry-ice bucket with samples
-   scoopulas & forceps
-   mortars & pestles
-   mortexer

**Purification Station**

-   centrifuge
-   microcentrifuge tube racks
-   pipettes
-   pipette tips

I tend to arrange my workflow left to right:

```

::: callout-tip
Make sure you have trash, pipette disposal, and liquid kit waste disposal containers within easy reach of the bench.

### Label Tubes

1.  pick out three microcentrifuge tube racks:

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR

C[[lysing<br>  <br>tube<br>  <br>rack]]
C --> D[[DNA<br>  <br>tube<br>  <br>rack]]

     classDef purple fill:#993399,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px;
     class E green
     class D yellow
     class C purple
```

2.  For each sample, arrange the following 9 tubes in microcentrifuge tube racks:
    1.  [bead-bashing tube]{style="background-color:#993399"}

    2.  [nuclease-free tube]{style="background-color:#993399"}

    3.  [DNA Spin-Away Filter (yellow) in a Collection Tube]{style="background-color:#ff0"}

    4.  [Collection Tube]{style="background-color:#ff0"}

    5.  [FINAL nuclease-free tube for eluted DNA]{style="background-color:#ff0"}

    6.  [Qubit assay tube for $1\mu L$ of eluted DNA]{style="background-color:#ff0"}

    7.  [RNA Spin-Away Filter (green) in a Collection Tube]{style="background-color:#9f6"}

    8.  [FINAL nuclease-free tube for eluted RNA]{style="background-color:#9f6"}

    9.  [Qubit assay tube for $1\mu L$ of eluted RNA]{style="background-color:#9f6"}

![Tubes should be laid out and labelled like this photo shown here ☝️](tube-racks.jpg){fig-alt="example of three microcentrifuge tube racks laid out and 9 labelled tubes" fig-align="center"}

You can also label an additional qubit tube if you are moving straight from extraction to quantification.

> Only thin-wall, clear 0.5 mL PCR tubes are appropriate for use in the Qubit® fluorometer. Acceptable tubes include [**Qubit® assay tubes**](https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/Q32856?gclid=CjwKCAjwuqiiBhBtEiwATgvixAYKxw1FwdqIxIiPSxZ-ngW738s6bl94L2cdLCFjXfosHgMX1hyAShoCv9cQAvD_BwE&ef_id=CjwKCAjwuqiiBhBtEiwATgvixAYKxw1FwdqIxIiPSxZ-ngW738s6bl94L2cdLCFjXfosHgMX1hyAShoCv9cQAvD_BwE:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!3652!3!529745253294!p!!g!!qubit%20tubes!7851124045!80648205054&cid=bid_pca_aqb_r01_co_cp1359_pjt0000_bid00000_0se_gaw_bt_pur_con) **(Invitrogen Cat.** **no.** **Q32856, 500 tubes) or [Axygen PCR-05-C tubes](https://us.vwr.com/store/product?keyword=10011-830)(VWR, part number 10011-830)**.

The qubit tube should only be labelled on the top; the sides should be clear so that the qubit fluorescence can be read without impedance.

The intermediate tubes and qubit tubes can just be labelled with the `cryo_id`, and whether they are RNA or DNA products such as: `1Ea DNA` or `2CHb RNA`

The **FINAL** tubes should be labelled with `cryo_id`, `DNA/RNA`, `extraction_id`, `date (ddMMMyy)`, & `initials`, such as:

```         
1Ea
ex1 SST
RNA
10APR23
```

⚠️**Important Notes! ⚠️**

-   **Use [ethanol-proof lab markers](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09L3Q99WL/ref=sspa_dk_hqp_detail_aax_0?psc=1&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9ocXBfc2hhcmVk&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEyWUpaVTc1M0pRMVImZW5jcnlwdGVkSWQ9QTAxMTgzODBJOFI3QlZFQ0pKQUsmZW5jcnlwdGVkQWRJZD1BMDc2MTE0M1ExRUdBSkEwOFBBRiZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX2hxcF9zaGFyZWQmYWN0aW9uPWNsaWNrUmVkaXJlY3QmZG9Ob3RMb2dDbGljaz10cnVl) to label tubes** *(ethanol is added to the green spin away collection tube)*
-   **Label collection tubes, not filters!**
-   **Always wear lab gloves that have been sterilized before handling tubes!**
-   **Shake tubes out of their bags onto sterilized surface, don't 'reach in' (this reduces potential contamination)**

### Prepare Buffers

-   [ ] If using the 50-prep kit (D7003), add `96 ml 100% ethanol (104 ml 95% ethanol)` to the 24 ml DNA/RNA Wash Buffer concentrate.

    ​ *If using the 10-prep kit, DNA/RNA Wash Buffer (D7003T) is supplied ready-to-use and does not require the addition of ethanol.*

-   [ ] Reconstitute `lyophilized DNase I` with `DNase/RNase-Free Water` and mix by gentle inversion. Use immediately or store frozen aliquots.

    -   [ ] 50-prep, add 275 µl water
    -   [ ] 10-prep, add 55 µl water

-   [ ] Reconstitute `lyophilized Proteinase K` at 20 mg/ml with `Proteinase K Storage Buffer` and mix by vortexing. Use immediately or store frozen aliquots.

    -   [ ] 50-prep, (60 mg), add 3.12 ml buffer
    -   [ ] 10-prep, (5 mg), add 0.26 ml (260 ul) buffer

-   [ ] To prepare a 1X solution of `DNA/RNA Shield™`, add an equal volume (5mL for the whole solution) of `nuclease-free water` (not provided) to the `DNA/RNA Shield™` (2X concentrate) (1:1) and mix with a quick pulse on the vortexer.

## Extraction Steps

### Grind/Homogenize: Mortar & Pestle Samples

1.  Take [dry-ice](#dry-ice) cooler to -80 freezer, pull out frozen samples and place them in the dry-ice cooler. Work quickly and carefully to sort through the vials and select the ones that you are working with. Nest the selected sample vials in the dry ice, and return the rest back to the -80 freezer. Bring working samples on dry-ice back to the lab bench.

2.  Don cryo-gloves over nitrile gloves and ⚠️carefully⚠️ dispense a small amount (no more than 1L) of liquid nitrogen (LN2) into the transfer thermos. **Everyone working with LN2 should have taken the Liquid Nitrogen Online Safety Course found [HERE](https://www.ehs.washington.edu/training/liquid-nitrogen-safety)**

3.  Grind each sample with mortar & pestle on LN2 -

    1.  ⚠️carefully⚠️ pour a small amount of LN2 into a [sterilized](#sterilize) mortar
    2.  Using [sterilized](#sterilize) forceps, pluck out coral fragments from the cryo vial and place in the mortar until you have as much material as about the size of an M&M (roughly a 16mm diameter sphere). Material amount does not have to be precise.
    3.  Pestle the coral fragment until it is ground to a powder. Work quickly to ensure the sample remains frozen. Add more LN2 when it evaporates from the mortar. This step is challenging! LN2 evaporates very quickly and must be replenished multiple times.

The coral is also very hard and prone to 'squirting out' from under the pestle

### Lyse: Bead-Bash Samples

1.  Use [sterilized](#sterilize) scoopula to transfer the sample powder to its correspondingly labelled [bead bashing tube](https://www.zymoresearch.com/collections/lysis-tubes/products/zr-bashingbead-lysis-tubes-0-1-0-5-mm)

2.  Aim to transfer 500uL of volume to each tube

3.  Add 500uL of `DNA/RNA Shield` to each 2mL (0.1 - 0.5mm) bead-bashing tube with powdered sample and vortex to ensure powder is submersed in `DNA/RNA Shield`

4.  Set bead-bashing tubes in Mortexer and vortex at high speed for 40 minutes

### Proteinase-K Digestion

1.  After bead bashing tubes are ['intensely bubbly'](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/Larvae-Ex-Protocol/#:~:text=Tubes%20after%20vortexing%20are%20intensely%20bubbly)

2.  To tamp down bubbles, centrifuge in the mini-centrifuge for 1-2 minutes

3.  Add Proteinase K & Buffer

    -   Add the appropriate volume of Pro K buffer and Proteinase K (Proteinase K is stored in the -20 after being reconstituted)

    -   (10:1 ratio of sample:digestion buffer) & (2:1 ratio of digestion buffer:Proteinase K)

    -   For tubes with 500uL of DNA/RNA Shield add:

        -   50ul pro k buffer
        -   25ul proteinase K

    -   If you have tubes with a larger volume you can scale up the volumes (ex for 700ul, you would use 70ul buffer and 35ul pro k)

4.  Incubate in heat-block for 30mins at 55C

5.  Vortex to mix

6.  Centrifuge on max for 30s

7.  Transfer $400 \mu L$ of the cleared supernatent to a nuclease-free tube

8.  Add $400 \mu L$ of **DNA/RNA Lysis Buffer** to the supernatent(1:1) and vortex to mix

### Purify DNA & RNA

1.  Transfer the buffered supernatent (should be a total of 800uL, which can be passed through the filter in one go) to yellow **Spin-Away Filter** in a **Collection Tube** and centrifuge

::: callout-danger
Save The flow-through in the collection tube for RNA purification! At this step the DNA is in the yellow spin column filter and the RNA is in the flow through.
:::

2.  Tranfser the yellow **Spin-Away Filter** to a new **Collection Tube**

3.  To the RNA flow-through, add 800uL (1:1) of 200-proof ethanol to the flow-through and mix by pipetting up and down 12 times

4.  In aliquots up to 700uL, transfer the RNA in ethanol to the green **Zymo-Spin IIICG Column** in a **Collection Tube**, centrifuge, and discard the flow-through. This step binds the RNA to the green column filter.

##### DNase 1 Treatment

5.  Add 400uL **DNA/RNA Wash Buffer** to the green **Zymo-Spin IIICG Column**, centrifuge and discard the flow-through

6.  To prepare **DNase 1 Reaction Mix**: $$
    DNase\, 1\, volume = 5 \mu L * (no.\, of\, sample\, preps)
    $$

$$
DNA\, Digestion\, Buffer\, volume  = 75 \mu L * (no.\, of\, sample\, preps)
$$

-   Add 75uL of **DNA Digestion Buffer** per prep to a new nuclease-free tube
-   Add 5uL of reconstituted **DNase 1** (thawed if previously frozen at $-20^{\circ}C$) per sample prep to the nuclease-free tube
-   Mix by gentle inversion

7.  Carefully drip $80 \mu L$ of **DNase 1 Reaction Mix** directly onto the green **Zymo-Spin IIICG Column** filter and let incubate at room temperature for 15mins

8.  Add $400 \mu L$ **DNA/RNA Prep Buffer** to each column and centrifuge at 16,000xg for 30s, then discard the flow-through

9.  Add $700 \mu L$ of **DNA/RNA Wash Buffer** to each column and centrifuge at 16,000xg for 30s, then discard the flow-through

10. Add $400 \mu L$ of **DNA/RNA Wash Buffer** to each column and centrifuge at 16,000xg for 2mins to ensure complete removal of the wash buffer, then discard the flow-through

11. Carefully transfer the column into the FINAL nuclease-free tube labelled for containing the eluted DNA/RNA end products

12. Add $50 \mu L$ **DNase/RNase-Free Water** directly to the column matrix and centrifuge at 16,000xg for 30s

13. Place FINAL eluted DNA/RNA tubes on ice

14. Transfer $1 \mu L$ of each eluted DNA/RNA sample to their respectively labelled Qubit assay tube, and place Qubit assay tubes with eluted DNA/RNA on ice

15. Store FINAL eluted DNA/RNA tubes in wax boxes in the $-80^{\circ}C$ freezer

16. Take Qubit assay tubes to run Qubit quantification on eluted DNA and RNA

    ## End Products

The end products are two 1.5mL vials per sample that contain:

1.  50ul of DNA in nuclease-free water
2.  50ul of RNA in nuclease-free water.

Place these vials on ice and for RNA proceed with [Qubit RNA Broad Range Protocol](https://sarahtanja.github.io/lab-book/protocols/protocol-qbit/)

OR, to continue lab-work later,

Place them in a wax freezer box, label the box, and freeze them in the -80C.
