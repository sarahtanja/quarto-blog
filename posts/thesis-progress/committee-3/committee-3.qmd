-   submitted signed proposal pdf to SAFS milestones

## Clarifications on experiment

::: notes
The samples are vials in which I placed two egg-sperm bundles from genetically distinct parent colonies, resulting in \~30-15 embryos per sample (depending on fertilization & survival). The microbiome and transcriptomics datasets are paired as the DNA/RNA were extracted from the same pooled samples.

![](Experimental_Assay_Design.jpeg)

-   12 treatments across leachate exposure and developmental milestones (hpf)
-   Microscopy n=9
-   July 5th & 6th
-   Originally n=10, dropped 1 cross due to no fertilization
-   Microbiome n=5 & Transcriptomics n=5
-   July 5th, 6th & 7th
-   Originally n=15, pooled samples (3 per) to have enough material to extract
