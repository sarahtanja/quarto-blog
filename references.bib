  abstract     = {The present study applies a chemical activity-based approach
                  to: 1) evaluate environmental concentrations of di-ethylhexyl
                  phthalate (DEHP; n = 23 651) and its metabolite
                  mono-ethylhexyl phthalate (MEHP; n = 1232) in 16 environmental
                  media from 1174 studies in the United States, Canada, Europe,
                  and Asia, and in vivo toxicity data from 934 studies in 20
                  species, as well as in vitro biological activity data from the
                  US Environmental Protection Agency's Toxicity Forecaster and
                  other sources; and 2) conduct a comprehensive environmental
                  risk analysis. The results show that the mean chemical
                  activities of DEHP and MEHP in abiotic environmental samples
                  from locations around the globe are 0.001 and 10-8 ,
                  respectively. This indicates that DEHP has reached on average
                  0.1\% of saturation in the abiotic environment. The mean
                  chemical activity of DEHP in biological samples is on average
                  100-fold lower than that in abiotic samples, likely because of
                  biotransformation of DEHP in biota. Biological responses in
                  both in vivo and in vitro tests occur at chemical activities
                  between 0.01 to 1 for DEHP and between approximately 10-6 and
                  10-2 for MEHP, suggesting a greater potency of MEHP compared
                  with DEHP. Chemical activities of both DEHP and MEHP in biota
                  samples were less than those causing biological responses in
                  the in vitro bioassays, without exception. A small fraction of
                  chemical activities of DEHP in abiotic environmental samples
                  (i.e., 4-8\%) and none (0\%) for MEHP were within the range of
                  chemical activities associated with observed toxicological
                  responses in the in vivo tests. The present study illustrates
                  the chemical activity approach for conducting risk analyses.

                  species, and whether this effect differs by sex. In this
                  study, blue mussels were exposed for seven days to both single
                  and combined stressors (i.e., +3 °C elevated temperature and
                  two environmentally relevant concentrations of the plastic
                  softener DEHP, 0.5 and 50 μg/l) in a factorial design. Males
                  were observed to be more sensitive to high temperature,
                  demonstrated by the significant increase in out-of-season
                  spawning gonads and higher gene expression of the antioxidant
                  catalase and the estrogen receptor genes. On the other hand,
                  while the gametogenesis cycle in females was more resilient
                  than in males, DEHP exposure altered the estrogen-related
                  receptor gene expression. We show that the combined stressors
                  DEHP and increased temperature, in environmentally relevant
                  magnitudes, have different consequences in male and female
                  mussels, with the potential to impact the timing and breeding

               Plastics are a group of materials, either synthetic or naturally

               retain the given shape. Plastics are polymers. A polymer is a
               substance made of many repeating units. The word polymer comes

                  sequencing approaches. Using powerful technology, however, is
                  not the same as having the necessary power to address a
                  research question with statistical robustness. In the rush to
                  adopt new and improved genomic research methods, limitations
                  of technology and experimental design may be initially
                  neglected. Here, we review these issues with regard to RNA
                  sequencing (RNA-seq). RNA-seq adds large-scale transcriptomics
                  to the toolkit of ecological and evolutionary biologists,
                  enabling differential gene expression (DE) studies in nonmodel
                  species without the need for prior genomic resources. High
                  biological variance is typical of field-based gene expression
                  studies and means that larger sample sizes are often needed to
                  achieve the same degree of statistical power as clinical
                  studies based on data from cell lines or inbred animal models.
                  Sequencing costs have plummeted, yet RNA-seq studies still
                  underutilize biological replication. Finite research budgets
                  force a trade-off between sequencing effort and replication in
                  RNA-seq experimental design. However, clear guidelines for
                  negotiating this trade-off, while taking into account
                  study-specific factors affecting power, are currently lacking.
                  Study designs that prioritize sequencing depth over
                  replication fail to capitalize on the power of RNA-seq
                  technology for DE inference. Significant recent research
                  effort has gone into developing statistical frameworks and
                  software tools for power analysis and sample size calculation
                  in the context of RNA-seq DE analysis. We synthesize progress
                  in this area and derive an accessible rule-of-thumb guide for
                  designing powerful RNA-seq experiments relevant in
                  eco-evolutionary and clinical settings alike.},

                  information on seaweed chemical contaminant levels in the
                  Salish Sea. Without this knowledge, health-based consumption
                  advisories can not be determined for consumers that include
                  Tribes and First Nations, Asian and Pacific Islander community
                  members, and recreational harvesters. We measured contaminant
                  concentrations in edible seaweeds (Fucus distichus, F.
                  spiralis, and Nereocystis luetkeana) from 43 locations in the
                  Salish Sea. Metals were analyzed in all samples, and 94
                  persistent organic pollutants (POPs) (i.e. 40 PCBs, 15 PBDEs,
                  17 PCDD/Fs, and 22 organochlorine pesticides) and 51 PAHs were
                  analyzed in Fucus spp. We compared concentrations of
                  contaminants to human health-based screening levels calculated
                  from the USEPA and to international limits. We then worked
                  with six focal contaminants that either exceeded screening
                  levels or international limits (Cd, total Hg, Pb,
                  benzo[a]pyrene [BaP], and PCBs) or are of regional interest
                  (total As). USEPA cancer-based screening levels were exceeded
                  in 30 samples for the PCBs and two samples for BaP. Cadmium
                  concentrations did not exceed the USEPA noncancer-based
                  screening level but did exceed international limits at all
                  sites. Lead exceeded international limits at three sites.
                  Because there are no screening levels for total Hg and total
                  As, and to be conservative, we made comparisons to methyl Hg
                  and inorganic As screening levels. All samples were below the
                  methyl Hg and above the inorganic As screening levels. Without
                  knowledge of the As speciation, we cannot assess the health
                  risk associated with the As. While seaweed was the focus, we
                  did not consider contaminant exposure from consuming other
                  foods. Other chemicals, such as contaminants of emerging
                  concern (e.g., PFAS, pharmaceuticals and personal care
                  products), should also be considered. Additionally, although
                  we focused on toxicological aspects, there are cultural and

                  choice.},

  abstract     = {Phthalates (PAEs) are of wide concern because they are
                  commonly used in various plastic products as plasticizers, and
                  can found their way into the environment. However, their
                  interaction with the environment and their toxicity in aquatic
                  animals is still a matter of intense debate. In this review on
                  PAEs in aquatic environments (lakes, rivers and seas), it is
                  found that there is a large variety and abundance of PAEs in
                  developing countries, and the total concentration of PAEs even
                  exceeds 200 μg / L. The interaction between metabolic
                  processes involved in the toxicity induced by various PAEs is
                  summarized for the first time in the article. Exposure of PAEs
                  can lead to activation of the detoxification system CYP450 and
                  endocrine system receptors of aquatic animals, which in turn
                  causes oxidative stress, metabolic disorders, endocrine
                  disorders, and immunosuppression. Meanwhile, each system can
                  activate / inhibit each other, causing genotoxicity and cell
                  apoptosis, resulting in the growth and development of
                  organisms being blocked. The mixed PAEs shows no cumulative
                  toxicity changes to aquatic animals. For the combined
                  pollution of other chemicals and PAEs, PAE can act as an
                  agonist or antagonist, leading to combined toxicity in
                  different directions. Phthalate monoesters (MPEs), the
                  metabolites of PAEs, are also toxic to aquatic animals,
                  however, the toxicity is weaker than the corresponding parent
                  compounds. This review summarizes and analyzes the current
                  ecotoxicological effects of PAEs on aquatic animals, and
                  provides guidance for future research.},

  abstract     = {For decades, studies of endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs)
                  have challenged traditional concepts in toxicology, in
                  particular the dogma of "the dose makes the poison," because
                  EDCs can have effects at low doses that are not predicted by
                  effects at higher doses. Here, we review two major concepts in
                  EDC studies: low dose and nonmonotonicity. Low-dose effects
                  were defined by the National Toxicology Program as those that
                  occur in the range of human exposures or effects observed at
                  doses below those used for traditional toxicological studies.
                  We review the mechanistic data for low-dose effects and use a
                  weight-of-evidence approach to analyze five examples from the
                  EDC literature. Additionally, we explore nonmonotonic
                  dose-response curves, defined as a nonlinear relationship
                  between dose and effect where the slope of the curve changes
                  sign somewhere within the range of doses examined. We provide
                  a detailed discussion of the mechanisms responsible for
                  generating these phenomena, plus hundreds of examples from the
                  cell culture, animal, and epidemiology literature. We
                  illustrate that nonmonotonic responses and low-dose effects
                  are remarkably common in studies of natural hormones and EDCs.
                  Whether low doses of EDCs influence certain human disorders is
                  no longer conjecture, because epidemiological studies show
                  that environmental exposures to EDCs are associated with human
                  diseases and disabilities. We conclude that when nonmonotonic
                  dose-response curves occur, the effects of low doses cannot be
                  predicted by the effects observed at high doses. Thus,
                  fundamental changes in chemical testing and safety
                  determination are needed to protect human health.},

                  microplastics, including high levels of black rubber—generally

                  ingest tire particles (TPs), past research focused on toxicity
                  of leachate alone, overlooking potential effects of particles.
                  To address these gaps, we assessed the toxicity of micro (1–20
                  µm) and nano (<1 µm) TPs for two model organisms, embryonic
                  Zebrafish Danio rerio and the crustacean Daphnia magna. To
                  assess effects on development, Zebrafish embryos were exposed
                  to concentrations of TPs or leachate ranging from 0 to 3.0 ×
                  109 particles/ml and 0–100\% respectively (n = 4). Greater
                  mortality and sublethal malformations were observed following
                  nano TP and leachate exposures as compared to micro TPs.
                  Unique abnormalities between the exposures indicates that
                  there is both chemical and particle-specific toxicity. We also
                  observed D. magna mortality following a 48 h exposure of
                  neonate to TPs or leachate, ranging from 0 to 3.3 × 109
                  particles/ml and 0–100\% respectively (n = 3). Though,
                  particleenhancement of toxicity was observed for both
                  Zebrafish and D. magna, overall sensitivity to TPs differed.
                  It is important to identify differential toxicities across
                  species to achieve an understanding of the environmental
                  impacts of TPs and the chemicals they leach.},

                  additives deliberately added to enhance the desirable

                  not chemically bound to the polymer, and potentially migrate
                  within the material reaching its surface, then possibly leach

                  weathering-driven fragmentation, and the release of additives,
                  are analysed together with the techniques currently employed
                  for chemically screening leachates. Because marine plastic
                  litter is a major concern, the review mainly focuses on the
                  effects of plastic leachates on marine flora and fauna.
                  Moreover, it also addresses impacts on freshwater organisms.
                  Finally, research needs and perspectives are examined, to
                  promote better focused investigations, that may support
                  developing different plastic materials and new regulations.},

                  marine ecosystems, being considered a major threat to marine
                  biota. One of the problems of microplastics is that they can
                  adsorb contaminants in extremely high concentrations. When
                  released from the particle, these contaminants have the
                  potential to cause toxic effects in the biota. So far, reports
                  of toxic effects are mostly linked with the direct exposure of
                  organisms through ingestion of contaminated microplastics.
                  There is little information on the toxicity of leachates from
                  microplastics to marine organisms. In this study, we conducted
                  experiments to evaluate the toxicity of leachates from virgin
                  and beached plastic pellets to embryo development of the brown
                  mussel (Perna perna). We compared the efficiency of two test
                  procedures, and evaluated the toxicity of beached pellets
                  collected in a coastal marine protected area. We observed that
                  mussel embryo is sensitive to leachate from both virgin and
                  beached pellets. However, the toxicity of the leachate from
                  beached pellets was much higher than that of virgin pellets.
                  We suggest contaminants adsorbed onto the surface of beached
                  pellets were responsible for the high toxicity of leachate
                  from beached pellets, while the toxicity of leachate from
                  virgin pellets was mainly due to plastic additives. Our
                  results suggest microplastic debris may be harmful even if
                  ingestion is not the only or main pathway of interaction of
                  marine organisms with contaminated plastic debris.},

  abstract     = {Plastics are persistent synthetic polymers that accumulate as
                  waste in the marine environment. Microplastic (MP) particles
                  are derived from the breakdown of larger debris or can enter
                  the environment as microscopic fragments. Because
                  filter-feeder organisms ingest MP while feeding, they are
                  likely to be impacted by MP pollution. To assess the impact of
                  polystyrene microspheres (micro-PS) on the physiology of the
                  Pacific oyster, adult oysters were experimentally exposed to
                  virgin micro-PS (2 and 6 µm in diameter; 0.023 mg·L−1) for 2
                  mo during a reproductive cycle. Effects were investigated on
                  ecophysiological parameters; cellular, transcriptomic, and
                  proteomic responses; fecundity; and offspring development.
                  Oysters preferentially ingested the 6-µm micro-PS over the
                  2-µm-diameter particles. Consumption of microalgae and
                  absorption efficiency were significantly higher in exposed
                  oysters, suggesting compensatory and physical effects on both
                  digestive parameters. After 2 mo, exposed oysters had
                  significant decreases in oocyte number (−38\%), diameter
                  (−5\%), and sperm velocity (−23\%). The D-larval yield and
                  larval development of offspring derived from exposed parents
                  decreased by 41\% and 18\%, respectively, compared with
                  control offspring. Dynamic energy budget modeling, supported
                  by transcriptomic profiles, suggested a significant shift of
                  energy allocation from reproduction to structural growth, and
                  elevated maintenance costs in exposed oysters, which is
                  thought to be caused by interference with energy uptake.
                  Molecular signatures of endocrine disruption were also
                  revealed, but no endocrine disruptors were found in the
                  biological samples. This study provides evidence that micro-PS
                  cause feeding modifications and reproductive disruption in
                  oysters, with significant impacts on offspring.},

                  threaten the fate of coral reefs and millions of people who
                  depend on them. Some reef-building corals respond to thermal
                  stress and subsequent bleaching with increases in
                  heterotrophy, which may increase the risk of ingesting
                  microplastics. Whether this heterotrophic plasticity affects
                  microplastics ingestion or whether ingesting microplastics
                  affects heterotrophic feeding in corals is unknown. To
                  determine this, two coral species, Montipora capitata and
                  Pocillopora damicornis , were exposed to ambient (~27 °C) and
                  increased (~30 °C) temperature and then fed microplastics,
                  Artemia nauplii, or both. Following thermal stress, both

                  trophic levels of the food web, however, remains unknown. Here
                  we show that plastics release dissolved organic carbon (DOC)
                  into the ambient seawater stimulating the activity of
                  heterotrophic microbes. Our estimates indicate that globally
                  up to 23,600 metric tons of DOC are leaching from marine
                  plastics annually. About 60\% of it is available to microbial
                  utilization in less than 5 days. If exposed to solar
                  radiation, however, this DOC becomes less labile. Thus,
                  plastic pollution of marine surface waters likely alters the
                  composition and activity of the base of the marine food webs.
                  It is predicted that plastic waste entering the ocean will

                  environments. At present, most of the studies on the toxicity
                  of microplastics are concentrated on aquatic feeding animals,
                  but relatively few have addressed freshwater algae. This study
                  investigated the effect of microplastics (polypropylene (PP)
                  and polyvinyl chloride (PVC)) exposure on the photosynthetic
                  system of freshwater algae over the logarithmic growth period.
                  The results showed that both PVC and PP had a negative effect
                  on chlorophyll a concentrations of Chlorella (C.) pyrenoidosa
                  and Microcystis (M.) flos-aquae; among them, when the
                  concentration of PVC exceeded 250 mg/L, compared with the
                  control group, the chlorophyll a content of C. pyrenoidosa was
                  reduced by 55.23\%. For photosynthetic activity, higher
                  concentrations of PVC and PP can induce lower values of Fv/Fm,
                  Fv/F0, and Fv’/Fm’, suggesting a larger impact in algae.
                  However, algae were able to adjust, with increased values of
                  Fv/Fm, Fv/F0, and Fv’/Fm’. This dose-negative effect
                  phenomenon also exists in the study of the rapid
                  light-response curves. In addition, comparing the two
                  microplastics, we could see that PVC greatly inhibits the
                  photosynthesis system of freshwater algae. Our study confirmed
                  that microplastics can affect algae growth under certain
                  concentrations, which provides evidence for understanding the
                  risks of microplastics.},

                  role in determining coral fitness. However, most knowledge of
                  the coral microbiome has come from reef-building scleractinian
                  corals, with far less known about the nature and importance of
                  the microbiome of octocorals (subclass Octocorallia), which
                  contribute significantly to reef biodiversity and functional
                  complexity. We examined the diversity and structure of the
                  bacterial component of octocoral microbiomes over summer and
                  winter, with a focus on two temperate (Erythropodium hicksoni,
                  Capnella gaboensis; Sydney Harbour) and two tropical
                  (Sinularia sp., Sarcophyton sp.; Heron Island) species common
                  to reefs in eastern Australia. Bacterial communities
                  associated with these octocorals were also compared to common
                  temperate (Plesiastrea versipora) and tropical (Acropora
                  aspera) hard corals from the same reefs. Using 16S rRNA
                  amplicon sequencing, bacterial diversity was found to be
                  heterogeneous among octocorals, but we observed changes in
                  composition between summer and winter for some species (C.
                  gaboensis and Sinularia sp.), but not for others (E. hicksoni
                  and Sarcophyton sp.). Bacterial community structure differed
                  significantly between all octocoral species within both the
                  temperate and tropical environments. However, on a seasonal
                  basis, those differences were less pronounced. The microbiomes
                  of C. gaboensis and Sinularia sp. were dominated by bacteria
                  belonging to the genus Endozoicomonas, which were a key
                  conserved feature of their core microbiomes. In contrast to
                  previous studies, our analysis revealed that Endozoicomonas
                  phylotypes are shared across different octocoral species,
                  inhabiting different environments. Together, our data
                  demonstrates that octocorals harbour a broad diversity of
                  bacterial partners, some of which comprise ‘core microbiomes’

  abstract     = {Due to its widespread use, large amounts of expanded
                  polystyrene (EPS) have been released into the marine
                  environment, where it is broken down into small pieces with
                  large surface areas. As such, chemical additives may be
                  released into the environment, which can affect marine
                  organisms; however, studies of the effects of such additives
                  are lacking. We assessed the effects of leachate from EPS on
                  the photosynthetic activities of four microalgal species
                  (Dunaliella salina, Scenedesmus rubescens, Chlorella
                  saccharophila, and Stichococcus bacillaris). They were exposed
                  to EPS leachate for seven days and their photosynthetic
                  activities were analyzed based on seven parameters. Overall,
                  leachate exposure increased photosynthetic activity in all
                  four species, albeit to different degrees and showing slightly
                  different trends among the seven parameters. Based on chemical
                  analysis, hexabromocyclododecane concentrations were higher in
                  small-fragment leachate, whereas UV326 concentrations were
                  higher in low-concentration-large-sphere leachate; bisphenol-A
                  and total organic carbon showed no major differences among
                  leachates. Thus, we speculate that exposure to trace chemicals
                  influenced microalgal photosynthesis and overall growth. These
                  results support further investigation of the impacts of

                  temperatures and partial pressure of CO2 in surface waters,
                  causing ocean warming and acidification. These changes may
                  have important consequences for the physiological performance
                  of early life-history stages of marine organisms. In this
                  study we investigated the potential for interactive effects of
                  ecologically relevant levels of temperature and pCO(2) on
                  germination, dormancy and mortality of zoospores of the giant
                  kelp Macrocystis pyrifera, a foundation species of temperate
                  reef ecosystems. Newly settled kelp spores were cultured in
                  the laboratory for seven days in a factorial design with
                  temperature (13 degrees C and 18 degrees C) and pCO(2)
                  (similar to 370 and similar to 1800 mu atm) as experimental
                  factors. The two levels of temperature and the low-pCO(2)
                  treatment in our design were consistent with present-day
                  environmental conditions in the kelp forest as measured by
                  autonomous temperature and pH sensors, while the high-pCO(2)
                  treatment reflects an extreme, future acidification scenario.
                  Our results revealed that the combined effects of increased
                  temperature and pCO(2) can significantly decrease germination
                  rates and increase the mortality of kelp spores. Interactive
                  effects of temperature and pCO(2) were detected,on spore
                  mortality and dormancy. Spore mortality only differed between
                  pCO(2) treatments at high temperature. In contrast, spore
                  dormancy was higher in the treatment with low temperature and
                  high pCO(2), which is similar to the environmental conditions
                  experienced during upwelling events in southern California.
                  Our results highlight the importance of considering multiple
                  stressors to understand how the early-stages of foundation
                  species such as M pyrifera will be affected by global change.

                  global and national governmental agreements to reduce
                  greenhouse gas emissions (e.g., the 2015 Paris Agreement) is
                  critical for the persistence of coral reefs. Despite these
                  initiatives, the health and abundance of corals reefs are
                  rapidly declining and other solutions will soon be required.
                  We have recently discussed options for using assisted
                  evolution (i.e., selective breeding, assisted gene flow,
                  conditioning or epigenetic programming, and the manipulation
                  of the coral microbiome) as a means to enhance environmental
                  stress tolerance of corals and the success of coral reef
                  restoration efforts. The 2014–2016 global coral bleaching
                  event has sharpened the focus on such interventionist
                  approaches. We highlight the necessity for consideration of
                  alternative (e.g., hybrid) ecosystem states, discuss traits of
                  resilient corals and coral reef ecosystems, and propose a
                  decision tree for incorporating assisted evolution into
                  restoration initiatives to enhance climate resilience of coral
                  reefs.},

                  and resilience to perturbations. Consequently, fostering tree
                  species diversity is discussed as an important management
                  approach to address the impacts of changing climate and
                  disturbance regimes. Yet, the effect of the spatial grain of
                  tree species mixtures remains unknown. We asked whether
                  increasing tree species diversity between stands (beta
                  diversity) has the same effect as increasing tree species
                  diversity within stands (alpha diversity) at similar overall
                  levels of richness (gamma diversity). We conducted a
                  multi-model simulation experiment under climate change,
                  applying two forest landscape models (iLand and LandClim)
                  across two contrasting landscapes of Central Europe. We
                  analysed the effect of different levels and configurations of
                  diversity on the disturbance impact and the temporal stability
                  of biomass stocks and forest structure. In general, increasing
                  levels of diversity decreased disturbance impacts. Positive
                  diversity effects increased with increasing severity of
                  climate change. Beta diversity buffered disturbance impacts on
                  landscape-level biomass stocks more strongly than alpha
                  diversity. The effects of the spatial configuration on forest
                  structure were more variable. Diversity effects on temporal
                  stability were less pronounced compared to disturbance
                  impacts, and mixture within and between stands had comparable
                  effects on temporal stability. Diversity effects were
                  context-dependent, with patterns varying between landscapes
                  and indicators. Furthermore, we found a strong species
                  identity effect, with increasing diversity being particularly
                  beneficial in conifer-dominated systems of the European Alps.
                  The two models agreed on the effects of different levels and
                  configurations of tree species diversity, underlining the
                  robustness of our findings. Synthesis and application.
                  Enhancing tree species diversity can buffer forest ecosystems
                  against increasing levels of perturbation. Mixing tree species
                  between stands is at least as effective as mixing tree species
                  within stands. Given the managerial advantages of
                  between-stand mixtures (e.g. reduced need to control
                  competition to maintain diversity, higher timber quality,
                  lower logistic effort), we conclude that forest management
                  should consider enhancing diversity at multiple spatial
                  scales. ​},

                  advancement of science. Ideally, the peer review process is an
                  unbiased, fair assessment of the scientific merit and
                  credibility of a study; however, well-documented biases arise
                  in all methods of peer review. Systemic biases have been shown
                  to directly impact the outcomes of peer review, yet little is
                  known about the downstream impacts of unprofessional reviewer
                  comments that are shared with authors. Methods In an anonymous
                  survey of international participants in science, technology,
                  engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields, we investigated
                  the pervasiveness and author perceptions of long-term
                  implications of receiving of unprofessional comments.
                  Specifically, we assessed authors’ perceptions of scientific
                  aptitude, productivity, and career trajectory after receiving
                  an unprofessional peer review. Results We show that survey
                  respondents across four intersecting categories of gender and
                  race/ethnicity received unprofessional peer review comments
                  equally. However, traditionally underrepresented groups in
                  STEM fields were most likely to perceive negative impacts on
                  scientific aptitude, productivity, and career advancement
                  after receiving an unprofessional peer review. Discussion
                  Studies show that a negative perception of aptitude leads to
                  lowered self-confidence, short-term disruptions in success and
                  productivity and delays in career advancement. Therefore, our
                  results indicate that unprofessional reviews likely have and
                  will continue to perpetuate the gap in STEM fields for
                  traditionally underrepresented groups in the sciences.},

  abstract     = {Over the last 60 years plastics production has increased
                  manifold, owing to their inexpensive, multipurpose, durable
                  and lightweight nature. These characteristics have raised the
                  demand for plastic materials that will continue to grow over
                  the coming years. However, with increased plastic materials
                  production, comes increased plastic material wastage creating
                  a number of challenges, as well as opportunities to the waste
                  management industry. The present overview highlights the waste
                  management and pollution challenges, emphasising on the
                  various chemical substances (known as “additives”) contained
                  in all plastic products for enhancing polymer properties and
                  prolonging their life. Despite how useful these additives are
                  in the functionality of polymer products, their potential to
                  contaminate soil, air, water and food is widely documented in
                  literature and described herein. These additives can
                  potentially migrate and undesirably lead to human exposure via
                  e.g. food contact materials, such as packaging. They can,
                  also, be released from plastics during the various recycling
                  and recovery processes and from the products produced from
                  recyclates. Thus, sound recycling has to be performed in such
                  a way as to ensure that emission of substances of high concern
                  and contamination of recycled products is avoided, ensuring
                  environmental and human health protection, at all times.},

                  bleaching is only known to occur after temperatures return to
                  normal, and mitigation of local stressors does not appear to
                  augment coral survival. Capitalizing on a natural experiment
                  in the equatorial Pacific, we track individual coral colonies
                  at sites spanning a gradient of local anthropogenic
                  disturbance through a tropical heatwave of unprecedented
                  duration. Unexpectedly, some corals survived the event by
                  recovering from bleaching while still at elevated
                  temperatures. These corals initially had heat-sensitive algal
                  symbiont communities, endured bleaching, and then recovered
                  through proliferation of heat-tolerant symbionts. This pathway
                  to survival only occurred in the absence of strong local
                  stressors. In contrast, corals in highly disturbed areas were
                  already dominated by heat-tolerant symbionts, and despite
                  initially resisting bleaching, these corals had no survival
                  advantage in one species and 3.3 times lower survival in the
                  other. These unanticipated connections between disturbance,
                  coral symbioses and heat stress resilience reveal multiple

                  what drives reef decline. Stressors such as overfishing and
                  nutrient pollution may reduce resilience of coral reefs by
                  increasing coral–algal competition and reducing coral
                  recruitment, growth and survivorship. Such effects may
                  themselves develop via several mechanisms, including
                  disruption of coral microbiomes. Here we report the results of
                  a 3-year field experiment simulating overfishing and nutrient
                  pollution. These stressors increase turf and macroalgal cover,
                  destabilizing microbiomes, elevating putative pathogen loads,
                  increasing disease more than twofold and increasing mortality

                  effects, further disrupting microbiomes of unhealthy corals
                  and concentrating 80\% of mortality in the warmest seasons.
                  Surprisingly, nutrients also increase bacterial opportunism

                  reef communities because they promote successful settlement by
                  corals and contribute to solidification of the reef framework.
                  We show experimentally that crustose coralline algae are also
                  capable of suppressing the growth and recruitment potential of
                  an abundant Hawaiian reef macroalga, Ulva fasciata. When mixed
                  communities of crustose coralline algae were absent, relative
                  growth rates of U. fasciata increased by 54.6\%. When
                  experimental nutrient additions were used to induce algal
                  spore release, effective recruitment of U. fasciata approached
                  zero only when crustose coralline algae were present. Mixed
                  communities of crustose coralline algae are thus capable of
                  limiting the local abundance of already-established macroalgae
                  by reducing both their growth rate and recruitment success.
                  This experimental observation was confirmed by field surveys.
                  Because crustose coralline species also induce settlement and

                  species, their abundance and species composition are expected

  abstract     = {Coral reefs, and their associated diverse ecosystems, are of
                  enormous ecological importance. In recent years, coral health
                  has been severely impacted by environmental stressors brought
                  on by human activity and climate change, threatening the
                  extinction of several major reef ecosystems. Reef damage is
                  mediated by a process called ‘coral bleaching’ where corals,
                  sea anemones, and other cnidarians lose their photosynthetic
                  algal symbionts (family Symbiodiniaceae) upon stress
                  induction, resulting in drastically decreased host energy
                  harvest and, ultimately, coral death. The mechanism by which
                  this critical cnidarian-algal symbiosis is lost remains poorly
                  understood. The larvae of the sea anemone, Exaiptasia pallida
                  (commonly referred to as ‘Aiptasia’) are an attractive model
                  organism to study this process, but they are large (∼100 mm in
                  length, ∼75 mm in diameter), deformable, and highly motile,
                  complicating long-term imaging and limiting study of this
                  critical endosymbiotic relationship in live organisms. Here,
                  we report ‘Traptasia’, a simple microfluidic device with
                  multiple traps designed to isolate and image individual, live
                  larvae of Aiptasia and their algal symbionts over extended
                  time courses. Using a trap design parameterized via fluid flow
                  simulations and polymer bead loading tests, we trapped
                  Aiptasia larvae containing algal symbionts and demonstrated
                  stable imaging for >10 hours. We visualized algae within
                  Aiptasia larvae and observed algal expulsion under an
                  environmental stressor. To our knowledge, this device is the
                  first to enable time-lapsed, high-throughput live imaging of
                  cnidarian larvae and their algal symbionts and, in further
                  implementation, could provide important insights into the
                  cellular mechanisms of cnidarian bleaching under different
                  environmental stressors. The ‘Traptasia’ device is simple to
                  use, requires minimal external equipment and no specialized
                  training to operate, and can easily be adapted using the trap
                  optimization data presented here to study a variety of large,
                  motile organisms.},

                  provide a temporal buffer for genetic adaptation. Epigenetic
                  mechanisms may be crucial for sessile benthic marine
                  organisms, such as reef-building corals, where ocean
                  acidification (OA) and warming reflect in strong negative
                  responses. We tested the potential for scleractinian corals to
                  exhibit phenotypic plasticity associated with a change in DNA
                  methylation in response to OA. Clonal coral fragments of the
                  environmentally sensitive Pocillopora damicornis and more
                  environmentally robust Montipora capitata were exposed to
                  fluctuating ambient pH (7.9–7.65) and low pH (7.6–7.35)
                  conditions in common garden tanks for 6 weeks. M. capitata
                  responded weakly, or acclimated more quickly, to OA, with no
                  difference in calcification, minimal separation of metabolomic
                  profiles, and no change in DNA methylation between treatments.
                  Conversely, P. damicornis exhibited diminished calcification
                  at low pH, stronger separation in metabolomic profiles, and
                  responsiveness of DNA methylation to treatment. Our data

                  function. In particular, salinity hampers germina­ tion,
                  growth, photosynthesis, transpiration, and stomatal
                  conductance. Salinity decreases leaf water potential and
                  turgor pressure and generates osmotic stress. Salinity
                  enhances reactive oxygen species (ROS) content in the plant
                  cell as a result of ion toxicity and disturbs ion homeostasis.

                  biochemical traits by regu­ lating ion homeostasis and
                  compartmentalization, antioxidant machinery, and biosynthesis
                  of osmoprotectants and phytohormones, i. e, auxins, abscisic
                  acid, brassinosteroids, cytokinins, ethylene, gibberellins,
                  salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, and polyamines. Thus, this
                  further modulates plant osmoticum, decreases ion toxicity, and
                  scavenges ROS. Plants upregulate various genes and proteins
                  that participate in salinity tolerance. They also promote the
                  production of various phytohormones and metabolites that
                  mitigate the toxic effect of salinity. Based on recent papers,
                  the deleterious effect of salinity on plant physiology is
                  discussed. Furthermore, it evaluates the physiological and
                  biochemical responses of the plant to salinity along with

                  erythraeum (Rothpletz) Kylin (6 \% cover) third in relative
                  importance. Porolithon onkodes (Heydrich) Foslie (3 \% cover),
                  although shown by its low density (4 \%) and frequency (6 \%)
                  to have a comparatively restricted distribution, is more

                  onkodes maintains and provides the surf-resistant reef edge
                  and is, therefore, of great ecological importance.
                  Coelenterate corals cover less than 1 \% of the total area and
                  are relatively unimportant on the fringing reef. The
                  hypothesis is developed that the high ratio (200 : 1) of
                  crustose corallines to corals at Waikiki may be partly due to
                  increases in eutrophication. Experimental evidence shows that
                  P. onkodes can withstand intense illumination and is thereby
                  unique among Hawaiian crustose Corallinaceae. Sporolithon
                  erythraeum is more typical of other crustose corallines since
                  it is physiologically adapted to low-light habitats.},

                  maximize the efficiency of restoration initiatives, we

                  rate) interact to enhance post-settlement survival and growth
                  of sexually propagated juvenile Montipora capitata. Larvae
                  were reared at 3 temperatures (high: 28.9°C, ambient: 27.2°C,
                  low: 24.5°C) for 72 h during larval development, and were
                  subsequently settled on aragonite plugs conditioned in
                  seawater (1 or 10 wk) and raised in different light and flow
                  regimes. These juvenile corals underwent a natural bleaching
                  event in Kāne‘ohe Bay, O‘ahu, Hawai‘i (USA), in summer 2019,
                  allowing us to opportunistically measure bleaching response in

                  how leveraging light and flow can increase the survivorship
                  and growth of juvenile M. capitata. In contrast, larval
                  preconditioning and substrate conditioning had little overall

                  bleaching tolerances. This study highlights the ability to

                  addressing knowledge gaps and incorporating practices that

                  the first step in the supply of new recruits to marine
                  ecosystem. The input of new propagules to coral reefs relies
                  on spawning events that display remarkable synchronicity
                  during limited periods each year. Although the timing of
                  spawning is known for most species, other aspects of coral
                  reproduction (polyp fecundity or spawning synchronicity) are
                  less understood. This largely reflects the sporadic nature of
                  reproductive activities and logistical problems of studying
                  the ephemeral coral spawning events in situ on the reef at
                  night. Here, we address this gap by exploring the spatial and
                  temporal spawning dynamics of Montipora capitata, a
                  broadcast-spawning, reef-building coral from the central
                  Pacific Ocean, by using the systematic sampling of gametes in
                  the field. Our results indicate that spawning in this species
                  varies among years, months and lunar days, and that the
                  proportion of colonies spawning and synchrony of spawning do
                  not reflect coral colony morphology, colony size or the
                  differences in environments between sites within a year. Major
                  differences in reproductive outputs (spawned material) were
                  observed between the 2 yr studied, which most probably
                  reflects variability in temperature between years or shifts in
                  the timing of spawning (phenology). This study highlights the
                  complexity of spawning dynamics in corals and suggests that a
                  more comprehensive understanding of interplay between
                  reproduction and environment is fundamentally important to
                  accurately predict the effects of climate change in these

                  coral symbiont). A recovery in Fv/Fm was observed in CCA
                  exposed to 31 °C following 7 days of recovery (at 27 °C);
                  however, CCA exposed to 32 °C did not recover during this time
                  as evidenced by the rapid growth of endolithic green algae. A
                  50\% reduction in the ability of N. fosliei to induce coral
                  larval metamorphosis at 32 °C accompanied the changes in
                  microbiology, pigmentation and photophysiology of the CCA.
                  This is the first experimental evidence to demonstrate how
                  thermal stress influences microbial associations on CCA with
                  subsequent downstream impacts on coral recruitment, which is
                  critical for reef regeneration and recovery from

                  we test the impact of temperature (mean ~ 27 °C vs. ~ 29 °C)
                  and nitrate and phosphate enrichment (ambient, + 5 µM nitrate,
                  + 1 µM phosphate and combined + 5 µM nitrate with 1 µM

                  with different modes of symbiont transmission and
                  reproduction: Lobactis scutaria (horizontal, gonochoric
                  broadcast spawner), Pocillopora acuta (vertical,

                  hermaphroditic broadcast spawner). Temperature and nutrient
                  effects were species specific and appear antagonistic for L.
                  scutaria and M. capitata, but not for P. acuta. Larvae
                  survivorship in all species was lowest under nitrate
                  enrichment at 27 °C. M. capitata and L. scutaria survivorship
                  increased at 29 °C. However, positive effects of warming on
                  survivorship were lost under high nitrate, but phosphate
                  attenuated nitrate effects when N/P ratios were balanced. P.
                  acuta larvae exhibited high survivorship (> 91\%) in all
                  treatments and showed little change in larval size, but lower
                  respiration rates at 29 °C. Elevated nutrients (+N+P) led to
                  the greatest loss in larvae size for aposymbiotic L. scutaria,
                  while positive growth in symbiotic M. capitata larvae was
                  reduced under warming and highest in +N+P treatments. Overall,
                  we report a greater sensitivity of broadcast spawners to
                  warming and nutrient changes compared to a brooding coral
                  species. These results suggest variability in biological
                  responses to warming and nutrient enrichment is influenced by
                  life-history traits, including the presence of symbionts

                  This work reports local transcriptomic patterns in populations
                  of the mussel Mytilus chilensis and their correspondence with
                  oceanographic variability in southern Chile. Analysis of gene
                  expression patterns was conducted through qPCR of seven
                  candidate genes involved in the response to environmental
                  stress (HSP70, HSP90), iron metabolism (Ferritin), pathogens
                  (Mytilin B, Defensin) and oxidative stress (SOD-CuZn,
                  Catalase) in at five study sites located in southern Chile,
                  from Valdivia (39°56′S–73°36′W) to Melinka (43°52′S–73°44′W).
                  Multivariate and correlation analyses were used to assess the
                  relationship between levels of individual gene expression and
                  site features characterized using satellite data on surface
                  temperature, chlorophyll concentration and total suspended
                  sediments. Two main groups of sites with differential patterns
                  of gene expression were identified. Individuals exposed to
                  higher temperatures showed an overexpression of HSP70, HSP90
                  and Ferritin genes. The expression of SOD-CuZn and Catalase
                  was correlated with local chlorophyll-a (i.e. food
                  availability for mussels), although with opposite
                  correlations. In addition, Mytilin B showed higher levels of
                  expression in areas with higher freshwater influence. Patterns
                  of gene expression across the region of interest suggest that

                  phenotypic changes in different populations of the same mussel
                  species. In addition, the analysis of expression patterns in
                  candidate genes can reveal local patterns in populations where
                  other molecular markers show no genetic structure.},

                  exported to the deep ocean. However, this perspective does not
                  account for CO2 from the consumption of external subsidies.
                  Here, we clarify: (i) the role of export relative to seaweed
                  net ecosystem production (NEP) for a closed system and one
                  more likely open to subsidies; (ii) the importance of
                  subsidies by compiling published estimates of NEP from
                  seaweed-dominated ecosystems; and (iii) discuss their impact
                  on the global seaweed net carbon balance and other
                  sequestration constraints as a mitigation service. Examples of
                  seaweed NEP (n = 18) were sparse and variable. Nevertheless,
                  the average NEP (−4.0 mmol C m–2 d–1 SE ± 12.2) suggested that
                  seaweed ecosystems are a C source, becoming increasingly
                  heterotrophic as their export is consumed. Critically,
                  mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions was mixed relative to
                  their replacement or baseline states, and where CO2 is
                  supplied independently of organic metabolism and atmospheric
                  exchange, we caution a sole reliance on NEP or NPP. This will
                  ensure a more accurate seaweed mitigation assessment, one that
                  does exceed their capacity and is effective within a
                  compliance and carbon trading scheme.},

                  habitats extending from equatorial Southeast Asia to the main
                  islands of Japan in the temperate northwest Pacific Ocean.
                  Symbiodinium boreum was associated with O. crispata in
                  temperate latitudes and S. eurythalpos was common to colonies
                  in the tropics. The geographical ranges of both symbiont
                  species overlapped in the subtropics where they sometimes
                  co-occurred in the same host colony. Symbiodinium trenchii sp.
                  nov. is also described. As a host-generalist symbiont, it
                  often occurs in symbiosis with various species of Scleractinia
                  possessing open (horizontal) modes of symbiont acquisition and
                  is common to reef coral communities thriving in warm turbid

                  Arabian/Persian Gulf, Red Sea and western Atlantic

                  S. eurythalpos were haploid, but microsatellite loci from
                  field-collected and cultured S. trenchii often possessed two

                  central question remains unanswered: given that corals and
                  their Symbiodinium symbionts have co-evolved for millions of
                  years, why does this clearly maladaptive process occur?
                  Bleaching may result from evolutionary conflict between the
                  host corals and their symbionts. Selection at the level of the
                  individual symbiont favors using the products of
                  photosynthesis for selfish replication, while selection at the
                  higher level favors using these products for growth of the
                  entire host/symbiont community. To hold the selfish
                  lower-level units in check, mechanisms of conflict mediation
                  must evolve. Fundamental features of photosynthesis have been
                  co-opted into conflict mediation so that symbionts that fail
                  to export these products produce high levels of reactive
                  oxygen species and undergo programmed cell death. These
                  mechanisms function very well under most environmental
                  conditions, but under conditions particularly detrimental to
                  photosynthesis, it is these mechanisms of conflict mediation
                  that trigger bleaching.},

                  temperature has resulted in significant coral reef degradation
                  in many tropical marine ecosystems. This bleaching has
                  frequently been attributed to photoinhibition of
                  photosynthetic electron transport and the consequent
                  photodamage to photosystem II (PSII) and the production of
                  damaging reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the zooxanthellae
                  (Symbiodinium spp.). However, these events may be because of
                  perturbations of other processes occurring within the
                  zooxanthellae or the host cells, and consequently constitute
                  only secondary responses to temperature increase. The
                  processes involved with the onset of photoinhibition of
                  electron transport, photodamage to PSII and pigment bleaching
                  in coral zooxanthellae are reviewed. Consideration is given to
                  how increases in temperature might lead to perturbations of
                  metabolic processes in the zooxanthellae and/or their host
                  cells, which could trigger events leading to bleaching. It is
                  concluded that production of ROS by the thylakoid
                  photosynthetic apparatus in the zooxanthellae plays a major
                  role in the onset of bleaching resulting from photoinhibition
                  of photosynthesis, although it is not clear which particular
                  ROS are involved. It is suggested that hydrogen peroxide
                  generated in the zooxanthellae may have a signalling role in
                  triggering the mechanisms that result in expulsion of

                  expulsion of Symbiodiniaceae from anemones, sponges, and
                  corals. The primary drivers of this phenomenon are the
                  inherent genetic variability in the Family Symbiodiniaceae,
                  and the variability in the abiotic environment for variables
                  such as irradiance and temperature. Recent experiments have
                  either disregarded the important interactive role of
                  irradiance or have suggested that photooxidative stress is not
                  a prerequisite for coral bleaching because certain reactive
                  oxygen species (ROS) can be produced in the dark. Here,

                  However, oxybenzone’s toxicity mechanism(s) are not
                  understood, hampering development of safer sunscreens. We
                  found that oxybenzone caused high mortality of a sea anemone
                  under simulated sunlight including ultraviolet (UV) radiation
                  (290 to 370 nanometers). Although oxybenzone itself protected
                  against UV-induced photo-oxidation, both the anemone and a
                  mushroom coral formed oxybenzone–glucoside conjugates that
                  were strong photo-oxidants. Algal symbionts sequestered these
                  conjugates, and mortality correlated with conjugate
                  concentrations in animal cytoplasm. Higher mortality in
                  anemones that lacked symbionts suggests an enhanced risk from
                  oxybenzone to corals bleached by rising temperatures. Because

                  localities have already phased out common components such as

                  attachment of glucose, turning it from a sunscreen into a
                  potent photosensitizer (see the Perspective by Hansel). The
                  glycoside conjugate is concentrated within the algal symbionts

                  pulse-amplitude-modulated (PAM) chlorophyll fluorescence and
                  photorespirometry. Exposure of Stylophora pistillata to 33 and
                  34 °C for 4 h resulted in (1) the development of strong
                  non-photochemical quenching (qN) of the chlorophyll
                  fluorescence signal, (2) marked decreases in photosynthetic
                  oxygen evolution, and (3) decreases in optimal quantum yield
                  (Fv/Fm) of photosystem II (PSII). Quantum yield decreased to a
                  greater extent on the illuminated surfaces of coral branches
                  than on lower (shaded) surfaces, and also when high irradiance
                  intensities were combined with elevated temperature (33 °C as
                  opposed to 28 °C). qN collapsed in heat-stressed samples when
                  quenching analysis was conducted in the absence of oxygen.
                  Collectively, these observations are interpreted as the
                  initiation of photoprotective dissipation of excess absorbed
                  energy as heat (qN) and O2-dependent electron flow through the
                  Mehler-Ascorbate-Peroxidase cycle (MAP-cycle) following the
                  point at which the rate of light-driven electron transport
                  exceeds the capacity of the Calvin cycle. A model for coral
                  bleaching is proposed whereby the primary site of heat damage
                  in S. pistillata is carboxylation within the Calvin cycle, as
                  has been observed during heat damage in higher plants. Damage
                  to PSII and a reduction in Fv/Fm (i.e. photoinhibition) are
                  secondary effects following the overwhelming of
                  photoprotective mechanisms by light. This secondary factor
                  increases the effect of the primary variable, temperature.
                  Potential restrictions of electron flow in heat-stressed
                  zooxanthellae are discussed with respect to Calvin cycle
                  enzymes and the unusual status of the dinoflagellate Rubisco.

                  is not the initial step in the sequence of heat stress in
                  zooxanthellae, and (2) light plays a key secondary role in the
                  initiation of the bleaching phenomena.},

                  confirmed using micro-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy
                  (µFTIR). We identified microplastics in all Antarctic snow
                  samples at an average concentration of 29 particles L−1, with
                  fibres the most common morphotype and polyethylene
                  terephthalate (PET) the most common polymer. To investigate
                  sources, backward air mass trajectories were run from the time
                  of sampling. These indicate potential long-range
                  transportation of up to 6000 km, assuming a residence time of
                  6.5 d. Local sources were also identified as potential inputs
                  into the environment as the polymers identified were
                  consistent with those used in clothing and equipment from
                  nearby research stations. This study adds to the growing body
                  of literature regarding microplastics as a ubiquitous airborne
                  pollutant and establishes their presence in Antarctica.},

  abstract     = {Background Corals, which form the foundation of biodiverse
                  reef ecosystems, are under threat from warming oceans. Reefs
                  provide essential ecological services, including food, income
                  from tourism, nutrient cycling, waste removal, and the
                  absorption of wave energy to mitigate erosion. Here, we
                  studied the coral thermal stress response using network
                  methods to analyze transcriptomic and polar metabolomic data
                  generated from the Hawaiian rice coral Montipora capitata.
                  Coral nubbins were exposed to ambient or thermal stress
                  conditions over a 5-week period, coinciding with a mass
                  spawning event of this species. The major goal of our study
                  was to expand the inventory of thermal stress-related genes
                  and metabolites present in M. capitata and to study
                  gene-metabolite interactions. These interactions provide the
                  foundation for functional or genetic analysis of key coral
                  genes as well as provide potentially diagnostic markers of
                  pre-bleaching stress. A secondary goal of our study was to
                  analyze the accumulation of sex hormones prior to and during
                  mass spawning to understand how thermal stress may impact
                  reproductive success in M. capitata. Methods M. capitata was
                  exposed to thermal stress during its spawning cycle over the
                  course of 5 weeks, during which time transcriptomic and polar
                  metabolomic data were collected. We analyzed these data
                  streams individually, and then integrated both data sets using
                  MAGI (Metabolite Annotation and Gene Integration) to
                  investigate molecular transitions and biochemical reactions.
                  Results Our results reveal the complexity of the thermal
                  stress phenome in M. capitata, which includes many genes
                  involved in redox regulation, biomineralization, and
                  reproduction. The size and number of modules in the gene
                  co-expression networks expanded from the initial stress
                  response to the onset of bleaching. The later stages involved
                  the suppression of metabolite transport by the coral host,
                  including a variety of sodium-coupled transporters and a
                  putative ammonium transporter, possibly as a response to
                  reduction in algal productivity. The gene-metabolite
                  integration data suggest that thermal treatment results in the
                  activation of animal redox stress pathways involved in
                  quenching molecular oxygen to prevent an overabundance of
                  reactive oxygen species. Lastly, evidence that thermal stress
                  affects reproductive activity was provided by the
                  downregulation of CYP-like genes and the irregular production
                  of sex hormones during the mass spawning cycle. Overall, redox
                  regulation and metabolite transport are key components of the
                  coral animal thermal stress phenome. Mass spawning was highly
                  attenuated under thermal stress, suggesting that global
                  climate change may negatively impact reproductive behavior in
                  this species.},

                  presence of microplastics in the natural environment. We
                  present the results of a systematic review of the literature
                  to assess the weight of evidence for microplastics causing
                  environmental harm. We conclude that microplastics do occur in
                  surface water and sediments. Fragments and fibers predominate,
                  with beads making up only a small proportion of the detected
                  microplastic types. Concentrations detected are orders of
                  magnitude lower than those reported to affect endpoints such
                  as biochemistry, feeding, reproduction, growth, tissue
                  inflammation and mortality in organisms. The evidence for
                  microplastics acting as a vector for hydrophobic organic
                  compounds to accumulate in organisms is also weak. The
                  available data therefore suggest that these materials are not
                  causing harm to the environment. There is, however, a mismatch
                  between the particle types, size ranges, and concentrations of
                  microplastics used in laboratory tests and those measured in
                  the environment. Select environmental compartments have also
                  received limited attention. There is an urgent need for
                  studies that address this mismatch by performing high quality

                  studies of zooxanthellae have been conducted using cultured

                  hospite zooxanthella populations of the individual host or
                  host species from which they were established. RFLPs of small
                  subunit (18S) rDNA, internal transcribed spacer (ITS)-rDNA
                  sequence data, and microsatellite analyses were conducted to
                  assess the relatedness between cultured zooxanthellae and the

                  examples of zooxanthella cultures being nonrepresentative of

                  cases, cultures are a subset of the original in hospite
                  population. Factors such as failing to homogenize bulk
                  cultures before transfer, growth medium used, and the picking
                  of single motile cells may contribute to many zooxanthella

  abstract     = {The sustainability of coral reef fisheries is jeopardized by
                  complex and interacting socio-ecological stressors that
                  undermine their contribution to food and nutrition security.
                  Climate change has emerged as one of the key stressors
                  threatening coral reefs and their fish-associated services.
                  How fish nutrient concentrations respond to warming oceans
                  remains unclear but these responses are probably affected by
                  both direct (metabolism and trophodynamics) and indirect
                  (habitat and species range shifts) effects. Climate-driven
                  coral habitat loss can cause changes in fish abundance and
                  biomass, revealing potential winners and losers among major
                  fisheries targets that can be predicted using ecological
                  indicators and biological traits. A critical next step is to
                  extend research focused on the quantity of available food
                  (fish biomass) to also consider its nutritional quality, which
                  is relevant to progress in the fields of food security and
                  malnutrition. Biological traits are robust predictors of fish
                  nutrient content and thus potentially indicate how
                  climate-driven changes are expected to impact nutrient
                  availability within future food webs on coral reefs. Here, we
                  outline future research priorities and an anticipatory
                  framework towards sustainable reef fisheries contributing to
                  nutrition-sensitive food systems in a warming ocean.},

                  archaeal symbionts, a subset of which are probably linked to
                  host health and homeostasis. Within a complex microbiome it
                  can be difficult to tease apart beneficial or parasitic
                  symbionts from nonessential commensal or transient
                  microorganisms; however, one approach is to detect strong
                  cophylogenetic patterns between microbial lineages and their
                  respective hosts. We employed the Procrustean approach to
                  cophylogeny (PACo) on 16S rRNA gene derived microbial
                  community profiles paired with COI, 18S rRNA and ITS1 host
                  phylogenies. Second, we undertook a network analysis to
                  identify groups of microbes that were co-occurring within our
                  host species. Across 12 coral, 10 octocoral and five sponge
                  species, each host group and their core microbiota (50\%
                  prevalence within host species replicates) had a significant
                  fit to the cophylogenetic model. Independent assessment of
                  each microbial genus and family found that bacteria and
                  archaea affiliated to Endozoicomonadaceae, Spirochaetaceae and
                  Nitrosopumilaceae have the strongest cophylogenetic signals.
                  Further, local Moran's I measure of spatial autocorrelation
                  identified 14 ASVs, including Endozoicomonadaceae and
                  Spirochaetaceae, whose distributions were significantly
                  clustered by host phylogeny. Four co-occurring subnetworks
                  were identified, each of which was dominant in a different
                  host group. Endozoicomonadaceae and Spirochaetaceae ASVs were
                  abundant among the subnetworks, particularly one subnetwork
                  that was exclusively comprised of these two bacterial families
                  and dominated the octocoral microbiota. Our results
                  disentangle key microbial interactions that occur within
                  complex microbiomes and reveal long-standing, essential

                  (NOAA/USA) is established, there is no feasible treatment that
                  can minimize temperature bleaching and/or disease impacts on
                  corals in the field. Here, we present the first attempts to
                  extrapolate the widespread and well-established use of
                  bacterial consortia to protect or improve health in other
                  organisms (e.g., humans and plants) to corals. Manipulation of
                  the coral-associated microbiome was facilitated through
                  addition of a consortium of native (isolated from Pocillopora
                  damicornis and surrounding seawater) putatively beneficial
                  microorganisms for corals (pBMCs), including five
                  Pseudoalteromonas sp., a Halomonas taeanensis and a Cobetia
                  marina-related species strains. The results from a controlled
                  aquarium experiment in two temperature regimes (26 °C and 30
                  °C) and four treatments (pBMC; pBMC with pathogen challenge –
                  Vibrio coralliilyticus, VC; pathogen challenge, VC; and
                  control) revealed the ability of the pBMC consortium to
                  partially mitigate coral bleaching. Significantly reduced
                  coral-bleaching metrics were observed in pBMC-inoculated
                  corals, in contrast to controls without pBMC addition,
                  especially challenged corals, which displayed strong bleaching
                  signs as indicated by significantly lower photopigment
                  contents and Fv/Fm ratios. The structure of the coral
                  microbiome community also differed between treatments and
                  specific bioindicators were correlated with corals inoculated
                  with pBMC (e.g., Cobetia sp.) or VC (e.g., Ruegeria sp.). Our
                  results indicate that the microbiome in corals can be
                  manipulated to lessen the effect of bleaching, thus helping to
                  alleviate pathogen and temperature stresses, with the addition
                  of BMCs representing a promising novel approach for minimizing

                  tribal nations, which account for 7.8\% of utility-scale wind
                  capacity, benefit from this policy shift? To examine why
                  tribal nations vary in translating wind energy potential into
                  wind installed capacity, we have constructed an original
                  dataset of the potential as well as the location of wind
                  turbines across tribal nations. Our statistical analysis of
                  286 tribal nations suggests that wind energy potential is not
                  associated with wind installed capacity. Instead, casino
                  square footage, a proxy for tribal nation’s administrative
                  capacity and business acumen, is associated with wind

                  well: tribal nations are more likely to have wind installed
                  capacity when they value tribal sovereignty. While tribes
                  suffering from natural disasters do not install more wind

                  projects, and located in states that already have a

                  large-scale transcriptomic study of a kelp species shows that
                  S. latissima responds to temperature and light stress with a
                  multitude of transcriptional changes: up to 32\% of genes
                  showed an altered expression after the exposure experiments.
                  High temperature had stronger effects on gene expression in S.
                  latissima than low temperature, reflected by the higher number
                  of temperature-responsive genes. We gained insights into
                  underlying molecular processes of acclimation, which includes
                  adjustment of the primary metabolism as well as induction of
                  several ROS scavengers and a sophisticated regulation of Hsps.
                  We show that S. latissima, as a cold adapted species, must
                  make stronger efforts for acclimating to high than to low
                  temperatures. The strongest response was caused by the
                  combination of high temperatures with high light intensities,
                  which proved most harmful for the alga.},

  abstract     = {In Puget Sound, where the effects of ocean acidification
                  threaten important marine resources, there is a heightened
                  need for investigating mitigation actions. Corrosive
                  conditions associated with acidification are already impacting
                  some calcifiers such as pteropods, crab, and foraminifera1,
                  and laboratory studies further suggest that oysters, crabs,
                  krill, and salmon are also sensitive to the effects of
                  acidification. These species are not only important to the
                  health of the marine ecosystem, but some are highly valued
                  culturally and economically as well. According to the
                  Governor’s Office, in the coming decades, as seawater absorbs
                  increasing amounts of dissolved carbon dioxide, conditions in
                  Washington waters are expected to worsen, with changes
                  occurring “more rapidly in Puget Sound waters than along our
                  coast.” In the face of these deteriorating conditions, we are
                  confronted with many questions, one of which is: what can we
                  do locally - in the water - to ameliorate the effects of
                  acidification? The investigation described in this report
                  sought an answer to that question. Thus began an investigation
                  into whether seaweed cultivation could draw down CO2 within
                  the kelp farm and improve conditions for calcifying species.
                  The field study was conducted at a five-acre seaweed and
                  shellfish farm operated by HCM, located off Hood Head, just
                  north of the Hood Canal Bridge in Jefferson County,
                  Washington. After acquiring the necessary permits, propagating
                  kelp seed, and outplanting sugar kelp (Saccharina latissima),
                  the team measured the effect of kelp on several metrics of
                  seawater chemistry and on a small suite of calcifying
                  organisms within the kelp farm. Additionally, the team
                  developed a computer model that simulates environmental
                  variables and kelp growth, and then integrates the sampling
                  data into an interface that graphically depicts the effect of
                  kelp cultivation on seawater chemistry. Comb​ined funding from
                  the Paul G. Allen Family Foundation and the U.S. Navy enabled
                  two years of field investigation at the Hood Head
                  demonstration site. Overall, the project was conducted
                  2015–2019 to test key early actions identified by the
                  Washington State Blue Ribbon Panel on Ocean Acidification.},

  abstract     = {BACKGROUND: Coral reefs house about 25\% of marine
                  biodiversity and are critical for the livelihood of many
                  communities by providing food, tourism revenue, and protection
                  from wave surge. These magnificent ecosystems are under
                  existential threat from anthropogenic climate change. Whereas
                  extensive ecological and physiological studies have addressed
                  coral response to environmental stress, high-quality reference
                  genome data are lacking for many of these species. The latter
                  issue hinders efforts to understand the genetic basis of
                  stress resistance and to design informed coral conservation
                  strategies. RESULTS: We report genome assemblies from 4 key
                  Hawaiian coral species, Montipora capitata, Pocillopora acuta,
                  Pocillopora meandrina, and Porites compressa. These species,
                  or members of these genera, are distributed worldwide and
                  therefore of broad scientific and ecological importance. For
                  M. capitata, an initial assembly was generated from short-read
                  Illumina and long-read PacBio data, which was then scaffolded
                  into 14 putative chromosomes using Omni-C sequencing. For P.
                  acuta, P. meandrina, and P. compressa, high-quality assemblies
                  were generated using short-read Illumina and long-read PacBio
                  data. The P. acuta assembly is from a triploid individual,
                  making it the first reference genome of a nondiploid coral
                  animal. CONCLUSIONS: These assemblies are significant
                  improvements over available data and provide invaluable
                  resources for supporting multiomics studies into coral
                  biology, not just in Hawai'i but also in other regions, where
                  related species exist. The P. acuta assembly provides a
                  platform for studying polyploidy in corals and its role in
                  genome evolution and stress adaptation in these organisms.},

                  and compared metabolomic profiles and microbial community
                  composition from nine reef-building coral species. These data
                  demonstrate metabolite profiles and microbial communities are
                  species-specific and are correlated to one another. Using
                  Porites spp. as a case study, we present evidence that the

                  clear threat to reef-building corals; however, the traits that
                  might influence corals’ survival and dispersal during climate
                  change remain poorly understood. Global gene expression
                  profiling is a powerful hypothesis-forming tool that can help
                  elucidate these traits. Here, we applied a novel RNA-Seq
                  protocol to study molecular responses to heat and settlement
                  inducers in aposymbiotic larvae of the reef-building coral
                  Acropora millepora. This analysis of a single full-sibling
                  family revealed contrasting responses between short- (4-h) and
                  long-term (5-day) exposures to elevated temperatures. Heat
                  shock proteins were up-regulated only in the short-term
                  treatment, while the long-term treatment induced the
                  down-regulation of ribosomal proteins and up-regulation of
                  genes associated with ion transport and metabolism (Ca2+ and
                  CO32−). We also profiled responses to settlement cues using a
                  natural cue (crustose coralline algae, CCA) and a synthetic
                  neuropeptide (GLW-amide). Both cues resulted in metamorphosis,
                  accompanied by differential expression of genes with known
                  developmental roles. Some genes were regulated only by the
                  natural cue, which may correspond to the
                  recruitment-associated behaviour and morphology changes that
                  precede metamorphosis under CCA treatment, but are bypassed
                  under GLW-amide treatment. Validation of these expression
                  profiles using qPCR confirmed the quantitative accuracy of our
                  RNA-Seq approach. Importantly, qPCR analysis of different
                  larval families revealed extensive variation in these
                  responses depending on genetic background, including
                  qualitative differences (i.e. up-regulation in one family and
                  down-regulation in another). Future studies of gene expression
                  in corals will have to address this genetic variation, which
                  could have important adaptive consequences for corals during
                  global climate change.},

                  offers researchers insight into changes in gene expression in
                  response to a myriad of natural or experimental conditions.
                  However, standard RNAseq methods (e.g., Illumina TruSeq® or
                  NEBNext®) can be cost prohibitive, especially when study
                  designs require large sample sizes. Consequently, RNAseq is
                  often underused as a method, or is applied to small sample
                  sizes that confer poor statistical power. Low cost RNAseq
                  methods could therefore enable far greater and more powerful
                  applications of transcriptomics in ecological genetics and
                  beyond. Standard mRNAseq is costly partly because one
                  sequences portions of the full length of all transcripts. Such
                  whole-mRNA data are redundant for estimates of relative gene
                  expression. TagSeq is an alternative method that focuses
                  sequencing effort on mRNAs’ 3’ end, reducing the necessary
                  sequencing depth per sample, and thus cost. We present a
                  revised TagSeq library construction procedure, and compare its
                  performance against NEBNext®, the ‘gold-standard’ whole
                  mRNAseq method. We built both TagSeq and NEBNext® libraries
                  from the same biological samples, each spiked with control
                  RNAs. We found that TagSeq measured the control RNA
                  distribution more accurately than NEBNext®, for a fraction of
                  the cost per sample ( 10\%). The higher accuracy of TagSeq was
                  particularly apparent for transcripts of moderate to low
                  abundance. Technical replicates of TagSeq libraries are highly
                  correlated, and were correlated with NEBNext® results.
                  Overall, we show that our modified TagSeq protocol is an
                  efficient alternative to traditional whole mRNAseq, offering
                  researchers comparable data at greatly reduced cost.},

                  and research on MP contamination has been done in marine,

                  pollution from hurting them is essential to maintaining coral
                  reefs' ecological and economic benefits. However, the public
                  and scientific communities must pay more attention to MP
                  research on the coral reef regions' distribution, effects,
                  mechanisms, and policy evaluations. Therefore, this review
                  summarizes the global MP distribution and source within the

                  coral reefs, existing policy, and further recommendations to

                  established when the margin of one species consistently
                  overgrows another. By measuring overgrowth patterns for the
                  two most abundant tidepool species of crustose coralline algae
                  (Lithophyllum impressum and Pseudolithophyllum whidbeyense) in
                  the San Juan Islands of Washington State, we documented a
                  reversal in competitive dominance that occurs at about the +1
                  m level; L. impressum wins in upper zones and P. whidbeyense
                  in lower zones. Regardless of tidepool elevation or species,
                  thicker crusts overgrow thinner ones and crusts of equal
                  thickness are competitively equal. Both crust species are
                  grazed by limpets (primarily Lottia pelta and Tectura scutum),
                  which are the dominant herbivores in tidepools. Laboratory
                  experiments show that limpet grazing can reduce crust
                  thickness. Laboratory and field analyses of limpet grazing
                  indicate that corallines in tidepools in the upper intertidal
                  zone are subject to high frequency (bite rate per unit area)
                  and low intensity (penetration depth per bite) limpet grazing,
                  whereas those in low tidepools are subjected to opposite
                  grazing characteristics. L. impressum is a thick crust, which
                  has a multicellular covering over its meristem. This covering
                  protects the growing portion of the plant from the frequent,
                  low—intensity herbivory that occurs in the higher tidepools.
                  In contrast, P. whidbeyense lacks a multilayered epithallus
                  and is more susceptible to injury in high tidepools. In low
                  pools, meristems of both crusts are injured. L. impressum
                  heals these deep wounds by regenerating vertically, but the
                  net result is a thinner plant that is easily overgrown. P.
                  whidbeyense dominates the low zone because it is capable of
                  much more rapid lateral growth including over its own deep
                  wounds; the crust overgrows itself, thereby developing a
                  thicker thallus and improving its competitive success over L.
                  impressum. We suggest that a continuum of defensive and
                  regenerative characteristics exists among organisms; the
                  adaptive nature of these depends on the levels of production
                  and the frequency and intensity of disturbance in their
                  environment. It is evident that herbivory is important in this
                  system, not by the traditional mechanism of releasing limiting
                  resources (e.g., primary space), but by mediating competitive
                  abilities through the relative susceptibility to, and recovery
                  from, herbivory—induced disturbance.},

                  functional symbiosis between a cnidarian animal host (the
                  coral) and intracellular photosynthetic dinoflagellate algae.
                  The molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying this
                  endosymbiosis are not well understood, in part because of the
                  difficulties of experimental work with corals. The small sea
                  anemone Aiptasia provides a tractable laboratory model for
                  investigating these mechanisms. Here we report on the assembly
                  and analysis of the Aiptasia genome, which will provide a
                  foundation for future studies and has revealed several
                  features that may be key to understanding the evolution and
                  function of the endosymbiosis. These features include genomic
                  rearrangements and taxonomically restricted genes that may be
                  functionally related to the symbiosis, aspects of host
                  dependence on alga-derived nutrients, a novel and expanded
                  cnidarian-specific family of putative pattern-recognition
                  receptors that might be involved in the animal-algal
                  interactions, and extensive lineage-specific horizontal gene
                  transfer. Extensive integration of genes of prokaryotic
                  origin, including genes for antimicrobial peptides, presumably
                  reflects an intimate association of the animal-algal pair also

  abstract  = {Octanol-water partition ratio is the most common way of
               expressing the lipophilicity of a compound, and it is defined as
               the ratio of the concentration of a solute in a water-saturated
               octanolic phase to its concentration in an octanol-saturated
               aqueous phase. In the early stage of the drug discovery process,
               lipophilicity is often ranked as one of the most important
               physicochemical properties to screen lead compounds, and it is
               also widely used in environmental risk assessment and
               agricultural fields. In addition, the correlation between
               lipophilicity and biological activity has provoked the extensive
               use of the octanol-water partition ratio, among others, as a
               descriptor in quantitative structure-activity/property
               relationships. In fact, it is contained in thousands of equations
               related to the behavior of biological systems. Therefore, many
               different experimental methods have been developed to determine
               octanol-water partition ratio. Some of them are direct methods,
               such as the shake-flask or the potentiometric methods, and other
               imply indirect measurements, like the chromatographic ones.
               Although it is time-consuming, the shake-flask method is
               considered the reference one. In general, there is good agreement
               between methodologies (especially between shake-flask and
               potentiometry), but each method offers its own advantages and
               drawbacks, and each one must be selected according to compounds’
               chemical properties. This chapter reviews the most important
               methods for octanol-water partition ratio determination and also
               describes its role in biological activity/properties estimation.},

                  chemistry of the ocean due to the increased absorption of
                  anthropogenically released CO2. Experiments to elucidate the
                  biological effects of ocean acidification on algae are not
                  straightforward because when pH is altered, the carbon
                  speciation in seawater is altered, which has implications for
                  photosynthesis and, for calcifying algae, calcification.
                  Furthermore, photosynthesis, respiration, and calcification
                  will themselves alter the pH of the seawater medium. In this
                  review, algal physiologists and seawater carbonate chemists
                  combine their knowledge to provide the fundamental information
                  on carbon physiology and seawater carbonate chemistry required
                  to comprehend the complexities of how ocean acidification
                  might affect algae metabolism. A wide range in responses of
                  algae to ocean acidification has been observed, which may be
                  explained by differences in algal physiology, timescales of
                  the responses measured, study duration, and the method
                  employed to alter pH. Two methods have been widely used in a
                  range of experimental systems: CO2 bubbling and HCl/NaOH
                  additions. These methods affect the speciation of carbonate
                  ions in the culture medium differently; we discuss how this
                  could influence the biological responses of algae and suggest
                  a third method based on HCl/NaHCO3 additions. We then discuss
                  eight key points that should be considered prior to setting up
                  experiments, including which method of manipulating pH to
                  choose, monitoring during experiments, techniques for adding
                  acidified seawater, biological side effects, and other
                  environmental factors. Finally, we consider incubation
                  timescales and prior conditioning of algae in terms of
                  regulation, acclimation, and adaptation to ocean
                  acidification.},

                  statistics to test for treatment effects with data from
                  experiments where either treatments are not replicated (though
                  samples may be) or replicates are not statistically
                  independent. In ANOVA terminology, it is the testing for
                  treatment effects with an error term inappropriate to the
                  hypothesis being considered. Scrutiny of 176 experimental
                  studies published between 1960 and the present revealed that
                  pseudoreplication occurred in 27\% of them, or 48\% of all
                  such studies that applied inferential statistics. The
                  incidence of pseudoreplication is especially high in studies
                  of marine benthos and small mammals. The critical features of
                  controlled experimentation are reviewed. Nondemonic intrusion
                  is defined as the impingement of chance events on an
                  experiment in progress. As a safeguard against both it and
                  preexisting gradients, interspersion of treatments is argued
                  to be an obligatory feature of good design. Especially in
                  small experiments, adequate interspersion can sometimes be
                  assured only by dispensing with strict randomization
                  procedures. Comprehension of this conflict between
                  interspersion and randomization is aided by distinguishing
                  pre—layout (or conventional) and layout—specific alpha
                  (probability of type I error). Suggestions are offered to
                  statisticians and editors of ecological journals as to how
                  ecologists' understanding of experimental design and
                  statistics might be improved.},

                  scientific community. Its principal critique concerns the lack
                  of independence in flawed experimental designs and the use of
                  inferential statistics to test the hypothesis of such
                  experiments. Thirty years after its appearance, it remains
                  misunderstood by many researchers, including ecotoxicologists.
                  In the present study, we try to clarify some of its concepts
                  by filling in what seems to be a gap in the terminology of
                  manipulative experiments. We propose the term “experimental
                  medium” to refer strictly to the relevant spatial scale of the
                  experiment to preserve the specificity of the experimental and
                  observational units and to display pseudoreplication as a kind
                  of misinterpretation and/or misanalysis of inferential
                  statistics. A classification of the types of experimental
                  designs in ecotoxicology is offered, and the problems in using
                  inferential statistics in suboptimal designs are discussed. We

                  previously analyzed as part of the 2006/2007 U.S.
                  Environmental Protection Agency's Targeted National Sewage
                  Sludge Survey (TNSSS). The results showed relatively good
                  interlaboratory agreement for analyses of di-ethylhexyl
                  phthalate (DEHP). Three independent laboratories (Labs A, B,

                  muscle (CARP-2) of 1,550 ± 148, 1,410 ± 193, and 1,380 ± 187,
                  respectively. Similarly, DEHP concentration measurements in
                  sewage sludge samples showed good agreement with those
                  reported in the 2006/2007 TNSSS report. Measured
                  concentrations of individual DPEs and C6–C10 isomeric mixtures
                  in these samples of municipal sewage sludge, which have not
                  been previously reported, ranged between 1 and 200,000 ng/g
                  dry weight. The results demonstrate that environmental
                  monitoring of DPEs is often hampered by high method detection
                  limits (MDLs), due to contamination of procedural blanks. It
                  is important to note, however, that when background

                  spectrometric (GC-HRMS)–based method was developed that
                  permitted the simultaneous determination of 30 estrogenic
                  endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and related compounds,
                  including surfactants, biogenic and synthetic steroids, fecal
                  sterols, phytoestrogens, and plasticizers, in wastewater.
                  Features of the method include low sample volume (∼40 ml),
                  optimized Florisil® cleanup to minimize matrix interferences
                  and optimized analyte derivatization to improve sensitivity
                  via GC-HRMS. Detection limits were in the low- to mid-ng/L
                  range, and recoveries were greater than 60\% for most target
                  analytes. This new method allows for high throughput analysis
                  of many organic wastewater contaminants in a complex matrix
                  with relative standard deviation of less than 15\% for most
                  measurable compounds. The applicability of the method was
                  demonstrated by examining wastewater samples from different
                  origins. Compounds such as di(2-ethylhex-yl)phthalate,
                  cholesterol, cholestanol, and other cholesterol derivatives
                  were measured in much higher concentrations in untreated
                  sewage and were reduced substantially in concentration by the
                  treatment process. However, steroidal compounds, particularly
                  estrone (E1), 17β-estradiol (E2), and estriol (E3), as well as
                  plant sterols (except stigmastanol), were greater in the
                  treated municipal wastewater versus the untreated effluent.
                  Plant and fungi sterols, stigmastanol and ergosterol, were
                  found largely associated with bleached kraft mill effluent
                  (BKME) as compared to the municipal effluents.},

                  coast of North America across the known range of the symbiont.
                  Freshly isolated Anthopleura symbionts were used for both
                  morphological and molecular analyses because Anthopleura
                  symbiont cultures were not available. Light and transmission
                  electron microscopy supported previous morphological studies,
                  showing the symbionts consist of spherical unicells from 5 to
                  10 μm in diameter, with numerous vesicles, and a single
                  bilobed chloroplast. Pyrenoids were not seen in LM, but a
                  thylakoid-free area was observed in TEM, consistent with
                  previous findings. Many algal cells extracted from fresh
                  anemone tissue were observed in the process of division,
                  producing two autospores within a maternal cell wall. The
                  morphology of the green symbionts matches that of
                  Elliptochloris Tscherm.-Woess. Molecular phylogenetic analyses
                  of the nuclear SSU rDNA and the plastid encoded gene for the

                  uncovered by restriction length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis
                  of the small subunit (SSU) and large subunit (LSU) ribosomal
                  RNA genes, and by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis
                  (DGGE) of the internal transcribed spacer region 2 (ITS 2).
                  The existence of two Symbiodinium species is substantiated by
                  sequence analysis of the variable regions V1, V2, and V3 of
                  the SSUrDNA, which also establishes their phylogenetic

                  Anemones from Washington and Oregon harbor a single
                  dinoflagellate species, for which we propose the name S.
                  muscatinei sp. nov. At these northern locations, S. muscatinei
                  either exists alone or co-occurs with the Chlorella-like green
                  algal symbiont. Our results indicate that S. muscatinei
                  co-occurs with a second dinoflagellate, S. californium, in
                  mixed populations in central and southern California. We
                  suggest that the geographic distribution of these
                  dinoflagellates is related to the temperature cline created by
                  latitude.},

                  relative abundance, the underlying algal physiological changes
                  that accompany these shifts are not well known. The sea
                  anemone Anthopleura elegantissima associates with the
                  dinoflagellate Symbiodinium muscatinei and the chlorophyte
                  Elliptochloris marina, symbionts with very different

                  performance of these symbionts in anemones maintained in an
                  8-11.5 month outdoor common garden experiment with simulated
                  intertidal conditions and three levels of shading (2, 43, and
                  85\% ambient irradiance). Symbiont densities, mitotic indices,
                  photophysiology and pigments were assessed at three time
                  points during the summer, a period of high irradiance and
                  solar heating during aerial exposure. Whereas S. muscatinei
                  was either neutrally or positively affected by higher
                  irradiance treatments, E. marina responded mostly negatively
                  to high irradiance. E. marina in the 85\% irradiance treatment
                  exhibited significantly reduced Pmax and chlorophyll early in
                  the summer, but it was not until nearly 3 months later that a
                  shift in symbiont relative abundance toward S. muscatinei
                  occurred, coincident with bleaching. Symbiont densities and
                  proportions remained largely stable in all other treatments
                  over time, and displacement of S. muscatinei by E. marina was
                  not observed in the 2\% irradiance treatment despite the
                  potentially better performance of E. marina. While our results
                  support the view that rapid changes in symbiont relative
                  abundance are typically associated with symbiont physiological
                  dysfunction and bleaching, they also show that significant
                  temporal lags may occur between the onset of symbiont stress
                  and shifts in symbiont relative abundances.},

                  endosymbiotic event and share many similarities in how they
                  were reduced and integrated with their host. However, the
                  subsequent evolution of the two organelles could hardly be
                  more different: mitochondria are a stable fixture of
                  eukaryotic cells that are neither lost nor shuffled between
                  lineages, whereas plastid evolution has been a complex mix of
                  movement, loss and replacement. Molecular data from the past
                  decade have substantially untangled this complex history, and
                  we now know that plastids are derived from a single
                  endosymbiotic event in the ancestor of glaucophytes, red algae
                  and green algae (including plants). The plastids of both red
                  algae and green algae were subsequently transferred to other
                  lineages by secondary endosymbiosis. Green algal plastids were
                  taken up by euglenids and chlorarachniophytes, as well as one
                  small group of dinoflagellates. Red algae appear to have been
                  taken up only once, giving rise to a diverse group called
                  chromalveolates. Additional layers of complexity come from
                  plastid loss, which has happened at least once and probably
                  many times, and replacement. Plastid loss is difficult to
                  prove, and cryptic, non-photosynthetic plastids are being
                  found in many non-photosynthetic lineages. In other cases,
                  photosynthetic lineages are now understood to have evolved
                  from ancestors with a plastid of different origin, so an
                  ancestral plastid has been replaced with a new one. Such
                  replacement has taken place in several dinoflagellates (by
                  tertiary endosymbiosis with other chromalveolates or serial
                  secondary endosymbiosis with a green alga), and apparently
                  also in two rhizarian lineages: chlorarachniophytes and
                  Paulinella (which appear to have evolved from chromalveolate
                  ancestors). The many twists and turns of plastid evolution
                  each represent major evolutionary transitions, and each offers
                  a glimpse into how genomes evolve and how cells integrate
                  through gene transfers and protein trafficking.},

                  anemones), 0.10 to 0.90 ZX (mixed), and >0.90 ZX (brown).
                  Brown anemones are primarily found in the high intertidal and
                  the upper region of tidepools. Mixed anemones are most common
                  at intermediate shore heights and green anemones are exclusive

                  Microhabitat was also important to algal proportion, as
                  anemones in crevices had greater proportions of ZC than
                  anemones in tidepools at the same shore height. In a

                  species of symbiotic dinoflagellates, known as zooxanthellae,
                  which coexist within the host at southern latitudes only. One
                  of these species, Symbiodinium muscatinei LaJeunesse et
                  Trench, has a broad latitudinal distribution, occurring in
                  intertidal anemones from Washington state to Southern
                  California. To investigate whether high thermal tolerance
                  contributes to the ability of S. muscatinei to inhabit
                  anemones from northern and southern regions, the upper thermal
                  tolerance limit for photosynthesis of symbionts in northern
                  (48°24′ N) populations of A. elegantissima was determined by
                  subjecting anemones to a gradual increase in temperature from
                  12°C to 30°C over a 10-week period. Light-saturated
                  photosynthetic rates of isolated zooxanthellae were the same
                  over the range of 12°C–24°C and declined significantly at
                  26°C, which is 14°C and 5°C above average summertime seawater
                  temperatures in northern Puget Sound and Southern California,
                  respectively. At 28°C, zooxanthellae isolated from the
                  anemones, and those expelled by their hosts, exhibited
                  extremely low rates of photosynthesis and highly reduced chl
                  content. The photosynthetic rates and chl content of expelled
                  zooxanthellae were lower than those of retained zooxanthellae.
                  The high thermal tolerance of S. muscatinei isolated from
                  northern populations of anemones supports the broad
                  latitudinal distribution of this symbiont, allowing it to
                  coexist with S. californium (\#383, Banaszak et al. 1993) in
                  southern populations of anemones.},

                  temperature during summertime low tides. Internal body
                  temperatures of emersed individuals of A. elegantissima were
                  monitored in a laboratory wind tunnel and in the field, and
                  factors influencing the anemones’ thermal experience were
                  examined. Larger body size and aggregation with conspecifics
                  slowed body temperature increases in controlled wind tunnel
                  conditions. In the field, anemones in the interior of an
                  aggregation stayed cooler than those on the edges, and
                  microhabitat features related to light exposure and surface

                  This paper investigates the responses to laboratory cadmium
                  exposures in the North American Pacific coast temperate sea
                  anemone Anthopleura elegantissima. Anemones were exposed to
                  cadmium chloride (control, 20 and 100 μg l−1 Cd) for 14 days
                  (sampled at days 0, 2, 7 and 14) and analyzed for Cd content
                  using inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS).
                  Higher levels of Cd were demonstrated in symbiotic anemones
                  compared to symbiont-free (aposymbiotic) anemones (e.g. 100 μg
                  l−1 Cd exposure at day 14; 12.4±2.4 and 4.5±1.9 ng Cd mg−1 dry
                  weight, respectively; t-test; p0.05) but rather to increased
                  accumulation by both partners. No changes in algal cell
                  density were observed in symbiotic anemone tentacle clips at
                  any dose or time point (ANOVA; p>0.05). Changes in glutathione
                  (GSH) levels have been proposed as a useful biomarker in other
                  marine invertebrates in response to heavy metal stress, but
                  GSH studies have not been reported for this species. We
                  demonstrate the presence of GSH in A. elegantissima and its
                  depletion (58.2\% of control values) following 1-week exposure
                  to buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), a nontoxic chemical known to
                  deplete GSH. Levels of GSH were higher in symbiotic compared
                  to aposymbiotic anemones (control averages, 563±81 and 485±58
                  nmol GSH mg−1 wet weight, respectively; t-test; p<0.001).
                  Following Cd exposure, significant reductions (t-test; p<0.05)
                  in GSH levels were observed only in the aposymbiotic anemones
                  (exposure to 100 μg l−1 Cd resulted in a 27\% reduction from
                  control levels at day 14). Our results demonstrate that the
                  accumulation of Cd depends upon symbiotic state and provides
                  the first identification of a GSH response in anemones and
                  indeed in any cnidarian in response to heavy metals.},

                  stressors in the temperate sea anemone Anthopleura

                  symbionts found in reef-building corals. Symbiotic anemones
                  were subjected to elevated temperature or UV over a 24 h
                  period. cDNA from these animals was hybridized to a
                  10,000-feature cDNA microarray of A. elegantissima. Overall
                  2.7\% of the 10,000 features were found to be differentially
                  expressed as a function of temperature or UV stress. Of the 86
                  features sequenced, 45\% displayed signiﬁcant homology to
                  sequences in GenBank. There are 27 features that were
                  differentially expressed in both stress conditions. Gene
                  ontology analysis placed the differentially expressed genes in
                  a wide range of categories including cytoskeleton organization
                  and biogenesis, protein biosynthesis, cell proliferation,
                  apoptosis and transport. This suggests that the early stress
                  response to elevated temperature and UV involves essentially
                  all aspects of host cellular regulation and machinery and that
                  downstream cnidarian bleaching is a complex cellular response

                  understanding of how essential genes function to facilitate
                  symbiosis establishment and maintenance remains limited. The

                  endosymbionts will enhance our understanding of these

                  very diﬀerent symbionts found within the temperate sea anemone
                  Anthopleura elegantissima: the chlorophyte Elliptochloris

                  their overall protein domains with other dinoﬂagellates and
                  chlorophytes. Our analysis identiﬁed several genes that are
                  potentially involved in mitigating stress response (e.g., heat
                  shock proteins pathways for mediating reactive oxygen species)
                  and metabolic exchange (e.g., ion transporters). Finally, we

                  and are expected to increase in intensity and frequency under
                  anthropogenic climate change. A variety of impacts have been
                  associated with these anomalous events, including shifts in
                  species ranges, local extinctions and economic impacts on
                  seafood industries through declines in important fishery
                  species and impacts on aquaculture. Extreme temperatures are
                  increasingly seen as important influences on biological
                  systems, yet a consistent definition of MHWs does not exist. A
                  clear definition will facilitate retrospective comparisons
                  between MHWs, enabling the synthesis and a mechanistic
                  understanding of the role of MHWs in marine ecosystems.
                  Building on research into atmospheric heatwaves, we propose
                  both a general and specific definition for MHWs, based on a
                  hierarchy of metrics that allow for different data sets to be
                  used in identifying MHWs. We generally define a MHW as a
                  prolonged discrete anomalously warm water event that can be
                  described by its duration, intensity, rate of evolution, and
                  spatial extent. Specifically, we consider an anomalously warm
                  event to be a MHW if it lasts for five or more days, with
                  temperatures warmer than the 90th percentile based on a
                  30-year historical baseline period. This structure provides
                  flexibility with regard to the description of MHWs and
                  transparency in communicating MHWs to a general audience. The
                  use of these metrics is illustrated for three 21st century
                  MHWs; the northern Mediterranean event in 2003, the Western
                  Australia ‘Ningaloo Niño’ in 2011, and the northwest Atlantic
                  event in 2012. We recommend a specific quantitative definition
                  for MHWs to facilitate global comparisons and to advance our
                  understanding of these phenomena.},

  abstract     = {Phthalic Acid Esters (PAEs) are a group of emerging organic
                  contaminants that have become a serious issue because of their
                  ubiquitous presence and hazardous impact on the marine
                  environment worldwide. Seawater samples were collected monthly
                  from December 2013 to November 2014 in the northwestern
                  Mediterranean Sea (Marseille Bay). The samples were analyzed
                  for dissolved organic carbon (DOC) as well as the molecular
                  distribution of dissolved PAEs by using solid phase extraction
                  followed by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC/MS)
                  analyses. The results demonstrated the occurrence of six PAEs,
                  including dimethyl phthalate (DMP), diethyl phthalate (DEP),
                  di-isobutyl phthalate (DiBP), di-n-butyl phthalate (DnBP),
                  benzylbutyl phthalate (BzBP) and diethylhexyl phthalate
                  (DEHP), with total concentrations ranging from 130 to
                  1330ngL−1 (av. 522ngL−1). In Marseille Bay, the highest
                  concentrations were detected in the bottom water from June to
                  November 2014 and in the whole water column during the winter
                  mixing period. This result suggests that resuspension of
                  PAE-rich sediment, in relation to the accumulation of plastic
                  debris above the seabed, or the higher degradation rate in the
                  upper layer of the water column, plays a significant role in
                  the PAE dynamics in coastal water. DEHP was the most abundant
                  PAE in all of the surface samples and the summer bottom
                  samples, followed by DiBP and DnBP, which also represent the
                  largest fractions in the other bottom samples.},

                  avoiding photoinhibition of photosystem II (PSII), which
                  occurs under conditions in which the rate of photodamage to
                  PSII exceeds the rate of its repair. However, the molecular
                  mechanism underlying how CEF contributes to photoprotection is
                  not yet well understood. We examined the effect of impairment
                  of CEF and thermal energy dissipation (qE) on photoinhibition
                  using CEF (pgr5) and qE (npq1 and npq4) mutants of Arabidopsis
                  (Arabidopsis thaliana) exposed to strong light. Impairment of
                  CEF by mutation of pgr5 suppressed qE and accelerated
                  photoinhibition. We found that impairment of qE, by mutations
                  of pgr5, npq1, and npq4, caused inhibition of the repair of
                  photodamaged PSII at the step of the de novo synthesis of the
                  D1 protein. In the presence of the chloroplast protein
                  synthesis inhibitor chloramphenicol, impairment of CEF, but
                  not impairment of qE, accelerated photoinhibition, and a
                  similar effect was obtained when leaves were infiltrated with
                  the protonophore nigericin. These results suggest that
                  CEF-dependent generation of ΔpH across the thylakoid membrane
                  helps to alleviate photoinhibition by at least two different
                  photoprotection mechanisms: one is linked to qE generation and
                  prevents the inhibition of the repair of photodamaged PSII at
                  the step of protein synthesis, and the other is independent of
                  qE and suppresses photodamage to PSII.},

                  and their photosynthetic endosymbionts. Unfortunately, this
                  relationship can be disrupted, with corals expelling these
                  algae when temperatures rise even marginally above the average
                  summer maximum. Interestingly, several studies indicate that
                  failure of corals to regulate symbiont cell divisions at high
                  temperatures may underlie this disruption; increased
                  proliferation of symbionts may stress host cells by
                  over-production of reactive oxygen species or by disrupting
                  the flow of nutrients. This needs to be further investigated,
                  so to begin deciphering the molecular mechanisms controlling
                  the cell cycle in these organisms, we used a computational
                  approach to identify putative cell cycle-regulating genes in

                  the health of microalgae. In situations of stress, access to
                  energy reserves can minimize physiological damage. Because of
                  its widespread requirements in biochemical processes, iron is
                  an important trace metal, especially for photosynthetic
                  organisms. Lowered iron availability in oceans experiencing
                  rising temperatures may contribute to the thermal sensitivity
                  of reef-building corals, which rely on mutualisms with
                  dinoflagellates to survive. To test the influence of iron
                  concentration on thermal sensitivity, the physiological
                  responses of cultured symbiotic dinoflagellates (genus
                  Breviolum; family Symbiodiniaceae) were evaluated when exposed
                  to increasing temperatures (26 to 30°C) and iron
                  concentrations ranging from replete (500 pM Fe’) to limiting
                  (50 pM Fe’) under a diurnal light cycle with saturating
                  radiance. Declines in photosynthetic efficiency at elevated
                  temperatures indicated sensitivity to heat stress.
                  Furthermore, five times the amount of iron was needed to reach
                  exponential growth during heat stress (50 pM Fe′ at 26–28°C
                  vs. 250 pM Fe′ at 30°C). In treatments where exponential
                  growth was reached, Breviolum psygmophilum grew faster than
                  B.minutum, possibly due to greater cellular contents of iron
                  and other trace metals. The metal composition of
                  B.psygmophilum shifted only at the highest temperature (30°C),
                  whereas changes in B.minutum were observed at lower
                  temperatures (28°C). The influence of iron availability in
                  modulating each alga’s response to thermal stress suggests the
                  importance of trace metals to the health of coral-algal
                  mutualisms. Ultimately, a greater ability to acquire scarce
                  metals may improve the tolerance of corals to physiological
                  stressors and contribute to the differences in performance
                  associated with hosting one symbiont species over another.},

                  microalgae residing in symbiotic cnidarians. The temperate sea
                  anemone Anthopleura elegantissima can occur in three symbiotic
                  states: hosting Breviolum muscatinei (brown), hosting
                  Elliptochloris marina (green) or without algal symbionts
                  (aposymbiotic). This provides a basis for A. elegantissima to
                  be a model for detailed studies of the role of CA in DIC
                  transport. This study investigated the effects of symbiosis,
                  body size and light on CA activity and expression, and
                  suggests that A. elegantissima has a heterotrophy-dominated

                  activity in brown anemones as a function of size, and (3) CA
                  activity in anemones of different symbiotic states that were
                  exposed to different light intensities. CA activity in brown
                  anemones was highest, whereas activity in green and
                  aposymbiotic anemones was low. Several CAs had expression
                  patterns that mirrored activity, while another had expression
                  that was inversely correlated with activity, suggesting that
                  symbionts may induce different DIC transport pathways.
                  Finally, CA activity was inversely correlated with anemone
                  size. Our results suggest that the observed CA activity and
                  expression patterns are affected not only by symbiosis, but
                  also by other factors in the host physiology, including
                  trophic strategy as it relates to body size and cellular pH

                  concentrations. Our goals are two-fold: 1) describe long-term
                  microparticle contamination data including concentration,
                  type, and size; and 2) determine if seasonal microparticle
                  concentrations are dependent on environmental or tourism
                  variables in Elliott Bay, Salish Sea. We sampled 100 L of
                  seawater at a depth of approximately 9 m at the Seattle
                  Aquarium, Seattle, Washington State, United States,
                  approximately every two weeks from 2019 through 2020 and used
                  an oil extraction protocol to separate microparticles. We
                  found that microparticle concentrations ranged from 0 to 0.64
                  particles L−1 and fibers were the most common type observed.
                  Microparticle concentrations exhibited a breakpoint on 10
                  April 2020, where estimated slope and associated microparticle
                  concentration significantly declined. Further, when
                  considering both environmental as well as tourism variables,
                  temporal microparticle concentration was best described by a
                  mixed-effects model, with tourism as the fixed effect and the
                  person counting microparticles as the random effect. Although
                  monitoring efforts presented set out to identify effects of
                  seasonality and interannual differences in microparticle
                  concentrations, it instead captured an effect of decreased
                  tourism due to the global Covid-19 pandemic. Long-term
                  monitoring is critical to establish temporal microparticle
                  concentrations and to help researchers understand if there are

                  defined as particles less than 5 mm in diameter. Published
                  survey data on sources of marine plastic debris demonstrate
                  the very limited contribution of aquaculture gear. Both

  abstract     = {We assessed the potential role played by two vital
                  Northeastern Pacific Ocean forage fishes, the Pacific sand
                  lance (Ammodytes personatus) and Pacific herring (Clupea
                  pallasii), as conduits for the vertical transfer of
                  microfibres in food webs. We quantified the number of
                  microfibres found in the stomachs of 734 sand lance and 205
                  herring that had been captured by an abundant seabird, the
                  rhinoceros auklet (Cerorhinca monocerata). Sampling took place
                  on six widely-dispersed breeding colonies in British Columbia,
                  Canada, and Washington State, USA, over one to eight years.
                  The North Pacific Ocean is a global hotspot for pollution, yet
                  few sand lance (1.5\%) or herring (2.0\%) had ingested
                  microfibres. In addition, there was no systematic relationship
                  between the prevalence of microplastics in the fish stomachs
                  vs. in waters around three of our study colonies (measured in
                  an earlier study). Sampling at a single site (Protection
                  Island, WA) in a single year (2016) yielded most (sand lance)
                  or all (herring) of the microfibres recovered over the 30
                  colony-years of sampling involved in this study, yet no
                  microfibres had been recovered there, in either species, in
                  the previous year. We thus found no evidence that sand lance
                  and herring currently act as major food-web conduits for
                  microfibres along British Columbia's outer coast, nor that the
                  local at-sea density of plastic necessarily determines how
                  much plastic enters marine food webs via zooplanktivores.
                  Extensive urban development around the Salish Sea probably
                  explains the elevated microfibre loads in fishes collected on
                  Protection Island, but we cannot account for the between-year
                  variation. Nonetheless, the existence of such marked
                  interannual variation indicates the importance of measuring
                  year-to-year variation in microfibre pollution both at sea and
                  in marine biota.},

                  Microplastics concentrations ranged from 8 to

                  Pacific waters, and increased 6, 12 and 27-fold in west coast

                  of anemones along repeatedly sampled transects over four
                  seasons and three shore heights revealed S. muscatinei to be
                  the dominant symbiont, with E. marina mostly limited to
                  anemones in the lower intertidal zone. At the lowest shore
                  height sampled (+0.2 m), the proportion of E. marina was
                  between 40\% and 50\% of the total symbiont population
                  throughout the year. Symbiont distribution patterns persisted
                  despite considerable seasonal variation in aerial exposure,
                  temperature, irradiance, nutrients, and phytoplankton

                  changed little despite three- to fourfold-higher division
                  frequencies of both symbionts during July and November.
                  Although the intertidal zonation of these symbionts was stable

                  but there is a lack of standard practices when analysing the
                  resulting data, limiting transparency and reproducibility. As
                  respirometry datasets become increasingly large and analytical
                  approaches more complex, manipulating the data remains a
                  challenge and often intractable with existing tools. Here we
                  describe the respR R package, a collection of functions that
                  implement a workflow-based approach to automate the analysis
                  and visualisation of respirometry data. The package can be
                  used for closed, intermittent flow, flow-through and open-tank
                  respirometry and uses well-defined sets of rules to reliably
                  and rapidly generate reproducible results. We demonstrate how
                  respR uses novel computing methods such as rolling regressions
                  and kernel density estimates to reliably detect maximum,
                  minimum and most linear sections of the data, and critical

                  pose an alarming hazard to human health and the general
                  wellbeing of global flora and fauna. To offer eco-friendly
                  solutions, living and non-living algae have lately been
                  identified and broadly practiced as promising agents in the
                  bioremediation of micropollutants. The approach is promoted by
                  recent findings seeing better removal performance, higher
                  efficiency, surface area, and binding affinity of algae in
                  various remediation events compared to bacteria and fungi. To
                  give a proper and significant insight into this technology,
                  this paper comprehensively reviews its current applications,
                  removal mechanisms, comparative efficacies, as well as future
                  outlooks and recommendations. In conducting the review, the
                  secondary data of micropollutants removal have been gathered
                  from numerous sources, from which their removal performances
                  are analyzed and presented in terms of strengths, weaknesses,
                  opportunities, and threats (SWOT), to specifically examine
                  their suitability for selected micropollutants remediation.
                  Based on kinetic, isotherm, thermodynamic, and SWOT analysis,
                  non-living algae are generally more suitable for dyes and
                  heavy metals removal, meanwhile living algae are appropriate
                  for removal of organic matters and PhACs. Moreover, parametric
                  effects on micropollutants removal are evaluated, highlighting
                  that pH is critical for biodegradation activity. For selective
                  pollutants, living and non-living algae show recommendable
                  prospects as agents for the efficient cleaning of industrial
                  wastewaters while awaiting further supporting discoveries in
                  encouraging technology assurance and extensive applications.},

  abstract     = {The slope of the initial linear range of a
                  photosynthesis–irradiance (P–I) curve, alpha (a), is
                  frequently, but often incorrectly, used to denote the maximal
                  quantum yield (or the ‘‘efﬁciency’’ of photosynthesis) of
                  higher plants and macroalgae under the conditions for which
                  the P–I curve was measured. When using the increasingly
                  popular method of pulse amplitude modulated (PAM) ﬂuorometry,
                  the determination of a from so-called rapid light curves (RLC)
                  may lead to misinterpretations when comparing photosynthetic
                  efﬁciencies under different environmental conditions.
                  Furthermore, since PAM ﬂuorometry measures the quantum yield
                  (Y) directly, there may be no need to estimate it from the
                  initial slopes of RLCs. We compared photosynthetic parameters
                  derived from RLCs of Ulva sp. measured during winter and
                  summer, and show large differences in a when electron
                  transport rates (ETR) were plotted against incident irradiance
                  (Ii) [a = 0.26 Æ 0.00 versus 0.08 Æ 0.01 during the winter
                  (November–December) and summer (July–August), respectively],
                  as is usually done. On the other hand, no differences in the
                  initial slopes of the RLCs were apparent when plotting ETR
                  versus the absorbed irradiance (Ia) (initial slope = 0.75 Æ
                  0.01 versus 0.62 Æ 0.12 during the winter and summer,
                  respectively); this is called for since also ETR is calculated
                  using Ia. Using the Ia based RLCs, it was also found that the
                  values of the initial slopes equalled those of the ﬁrst
                  Y-value measurements of the RLCs (Y0) (t-test, p > 0.05, r2 =
                  0.85). Therefore, when using PAM ﬂuorometry, we suggest (a) to
                  present the x-axis of RLCs as Ia (Ii Â AF Â 0.5), and ETR on
                  the y-axis as Y Â Ia, and (b) that Y0 can be taken as a
                  correct measure of the maximal quantum yield instead of
                  estimating it from an RLC.},

                  for reef corals of hosting multiple types of the symbiotic
                  dinoflagellate Symbiodinium. Amongst these is their apparent
                  capacity to tolerate higher than normal water temperatures.
                  There is strong photokinetic evidence that the trait of
                  heat-tolerance in plants is accompanied by energetic tradeoffs
                  but little such evidence yet exists for corals. We use rapid
                  light curves (RLCs) to investigate the photokinetic basis for
                  thermo-tolerance in the reef coral Acropora millepora with
                  symbionts of contrasting thermal tolerance for which there are
                  measured differences in energetics. Our results show that
                  under non-stressful temperatures, corals with heat-tolerant
                  type D Symbiodinium had a 41\% lower maximum relative electron
                  transport rate (rETRmax) and lower light absorption efficiency
                  (α) due to lower cell Chl a content compared with corals with
                  heat-sensitive type C2 symbionts. Our results provide support
                  for a photokinetic link between heat tolerance and deficits in
                  holobiont (coral + symbiont) growth, lipid stores and
                  reproduction. Reduced electron transport rate and light
                  absorption capacity may be genotype-specific attributes that
                  enable clade D symbionts and their cnidarian hosts to cope
                  with temperature stress but they inherently influence the
                  photosynthetic function of the symbionts and thus have
                  negative downstream effects on the coral.},

                  to understand the processes driving reef persistence and
                  replenishment, including coral reproduction and development.
                  Here, we quantified gene expression and sensitivity to ocean
                  acidification across a set of developmental stages in the rice
                  coral, Montipora capitata. Embryos and swimming larvae were
                  exposed to pH treatments of 7.8 (ambient), 7.6 (low) and 7.3
                  (extreme low) from fertilization to 9 days post-fertilization.
                  Embryo and larval volume, and stage-specific gene expression
                  were compared between treatments to determine the effects of
                  acidified seawater on early development. Although there was no
                  measurable size differentiation between pH treatments at the
                  fertilized egg and prawn chip (9 h post-fertilization) stages,
                  early gastrulae and larvae raised in reduced pH treatments
                  were significantly smaller than those raised in ambient
                  seawater, suggesting an energetic cost to developing under low
                  pH. However, no differentially expressed genes were found
                  until the swimming larval stage. Notably, gene expression
                  patterns of larvae developing at pH 7.8 and pH 7.3 were more
                  similar than those of larvae developing at pH 7.6. Larvae from
                  pH 7.6 showed upregulation of genes involved in cell division,
                  regulation of transcription, lipid metabolism and response to
                  oxidative stress in comparison to the other two treatments.
                  Although low pH appears to increase energetic demands and
                  trigger oxidative stress in larvae, the developmental process
                  is robust to this at a molecular level, with the swimming
                  larval stage reached in all pH treatments.},

                  than during the mornings under similar incident PAR values.
                  These results indicate an afternoon loss in photosynthetic
                  capacity from photoinhibition. Such photoinhibition was not
                  apparent during the course of the day in the corals growing in
                  deeper water. The latter also showed no saturation of
                  photosynthesis at the highest incident PAR values at noon
                  (which were approximately a third of those at the shallower
                  site). In addition, the shallow-growing corals showed
                  significantly lower maximum quantum yields (ΔF/F′m measured
                  during nighttime, equivalent to Fv/Fm) than the deeper growing
                  ones. This is most likely caused by an additional, more
                  chronic, photoinhibition in the shallow-growing corals but
                  could also be due to some form of photoacclimation or to
                  factors other than light.},

                  within the tissues of two reef-building corals in response to
                  normal and excess irradiance at water temperatures < 30 °C
                  were investigated using pulse amplitude modulated (PAM)
                  chlorophyll fluorescence techniques. Dark-adapted Fv/Fm showed
                  clear diurnal changes, decreasing to a low at solar noon and
                  increasing in the afternoon. However, Fv/Fm also drifted
                  downwards at night or in prolonged darkness, and increased
                  rapidly during the early morning twilight. This parameter also
                  increased when the oxygen concentration of the water holding
                  the corals was increased. Such changes have not been described
                  previously, and most probably reflect state transitions
                  associated with PQ pool reduction via chlororespiration. These
                  unusual characteristics may be a feature of an endosymbiotic
                  environment, reflective of the well-documented night-time
                  tissue hypoxia that occurs in corals. Fv/Fm decreased to 0·25
                  in response to full sunlight in shade-acclimated (shade)
                  colonies of Stylophora pistillata, which is considerably lower
                  than in light-acclimated (sun) colonies. In sun colonies, the
                  reversible decrease in Fv/Fm was caused by a lowering of Fm
                  and Fo suggesting photoprotection and no lasting damage. The
                  decrease in Fv/Fm, however, was caused by a decrease in Fm and
                  an increase in Fo in shade colonies suggesting
                  photoinactivation and long-term cumulative photoinhibition.
                  Shade colonies rapidly lost their symbiotic algae (bleached)
                  during exposure to full sunlight. This study is consistent
                  with the hypothesis that excess light leads to chronic damage
                  of symbiotic dinoflagellates and their eventual removal from
                  reef-building corals. It is significant that this can occur
                  with high light conditions alone.},

                  used to estimate the relative photosynthetic efficiency of
                  corals. However, both the optical properties of intact corals
                  as well as past technical constrains to PAM fluorometers have
                  prevented calculations of the electron turnover rate of PSII.
                  We used a new Multi-colour PAM (MC-PAM) in parallel with light
                  microsensors to determine for the first time the
                  wavelength-specific effective absorption cross-section of PSII
                  photochemistry, σII(λ), and thus PAM-based absolute electron
                  transport rates of the coral photosymbiont Symbiodinium both
                  in culture and in hospite in the coral Pocillopora damicornis.
                  In both cases, σII of Symbiodinium was highest in the blue
                  spectral region and showed a progressive decrease towards red
                  wavelengths. Absolute values for σII at 440 nm were up to
                  1.5-times higher in culture than in hospite. Scalar irradiance
                  within the living coral tissue was reduced by 20\% in the blue
                  when compared to the incident downwelling irradiance. Absolute
                  electron transport rates of P. damicornis at 440 nm revealed a
                  maximum PSII turnover rate of ca. 250 electrons PSII−1 s−1,
                  consistent with one PSII turnover for every 4 photons absorbed
                  by PSII; this likely reflects the limiting steps in electron
                  transfer between PSII and PSI. Our results show that optical
                  properties of the coral host strongly affect light use
                  efficiency of Symbiodinium. Therefore, relative electron
                  transport rates do not reflect the productivity rates (or
                  indeed how the photosynthesis-light response is
                  parameterised). Here we provide a non-invasive approach to
                  estimate absolute electron transport rates in corals.},

                  (= Gymnodinium) microadriaticum Freudenthal, was investigated
                  in anemones that were fed and starved for 2 wk under
                  laboratory conditions or newly collected from the intertidal
                  zone. The photosynthetic performances of this association were
                  similar to those of marine phytoplankton and intertidal
                  seaweeds. Light saturation for Anthopleura elegantissima
                  occurred between 125–350μE · m−2 · s−1 and inhibition was not
                  observed at intensities up to 1550 μE · m−2 · s−1.
                  Weight-specific gross photosynthetic rates decreased with
                  increasing anemone size and were similar for fed, starved, and
                  newly collected anemones. Gross photosynthetic rates were
                  positively correlated with chlorophyll a content and number of
                  zooxanthellae. Weight-specific respiration rates also
                  decreased with increasing anemone size. Fed anemones respired
                  at rates about twice those of starved anemones and A.
                  elegantissima measured within 10 h of collection had
                  respiration rates similar to starved anemones. Gross
                  photosynthesis to respiration (P : R) ratios were a function
                  of the nutritional state of the anemones, typically ranging
                  from 2.0 to 3.0 for starved anemones, but seldom over 1.0 for
                  fed anemones. Estimates of the relative contribution of carbon
                  from the zooxanthellae to the host (animal) respiratory carbon
                  depended on host nutritional state, averaging ≈ 13\% for fed
                  anemones and 45\% for starved or newly collected anemones.
                  Photosynthetic rates were similar to temperate intertidal

  abstract     = {BACKGROUND: Tropical coral reefs cover only ca. 0.1\% of the
                  Earth's surface but harbour exceptional marine biodiversity
                  and provide vital ecosystem services to millions of people
                  living nearby. They are currently threatened by global (e.g.
                  climate change) and local (e.g. chemical pollution) stressors
                  that interact in multiple ways. While global stressors cannot
                  be mitigated by local actions alone, local stressors can be
                  reduced through ecosystem management. Here, we aimed to
                  systematically review experimental studies assessing the
                  toxicity of chemical pollutants to tropical reef-building
                  corals to generate accessible and usable knowledge and data
                  that can be used to calculate measurement endpoints in
                  ecological risk assessment. From the quantitative estimates of
                  effects, we determined toxicity thresholds as the highest
                  exposures tested at which no statistically significant adverse
                  effects were observed, and we compared them to regulatory
                  predicted no effect concentrations for the protection of
                  marine organisms, to assess whether these reference values are
                  indeed protective of corals. METHODS: The evidence was taken
                  from a systematic map of the impacts of chemicals arising from
                  human activity on tropical reef-building corals published in
                  2021. All studies in the map database corresponding to the
                  knowledge cluster "Evidence on the ecotoxicological effects of
                  chemicals on corals" were selected. To identify subsequently
                  published literature, the search was updated using a subset of
                  the search string used for the systematic map. Titles,
                  abstracts and full-texts were screened according to the
                  criteria defining the selected cluster of the map. Because the
                  eligibility criteria for the systematic review are narrower
                  than the criteria used to define the cluster in the systematic
                  map, additional screening was performed. Studies included were
                  critically appraised and each study was rated as low, unclear,
                  medium, or high risk of bias. Data were extracted from the
                  studies and synthesised according to a strategy dependent on
                  the type of exposure and outcome. REVIEW FINDINGS: The
                  systematic review reports the known effects of chemical
                  exposures on corals from 847 studies corresponding to 181
                  articles. A total of 697 studies (161 articles) were included
                  in the quantitative synthesis and 150 studies (50 articles) in
                  the narrative synthesis of the findings. The quantitative
                  synthesis records the effects of 2706 exposure
                  concentrations-durations of 164 chemicals or mixtures of
                  chemicals, and identifies 105 toxicity thresholds
                  corresponding to 56 chemicals or mixtures of chemicals. When
                  toxicity thresholds were compared to reference values set for
                  the protection of marine organisms by environmental agencies,
                  the reference values appear to be protective of corals for all
                  but three chemicals assessed: the metal copper and the
                  pesticides diuron and irgarol 1051. CONCLUSIONS: This
                  open-access database of known ecotoxicological effects of
                  chemical exposures on corals can assist managers in the
                  ecological risk assessment of chemicals, by allowing easy
                  determination of various ecotoxicological thresholds. Several
                  limitations of the toxicity tests synthesised here were noted
                  (in particular the lack of measurement of effective
                  concentrations for more than half of the studies). Overall,
                  most of the currently available data on coral toxicity should
                  be replicated independently and extended to corals from less
                  studied geographical regions and functional groups.},

  abstract     = {Coral reefs are in global decline due to climate change and
                  anthropogenic influences (Hughes et al., 2013). Near coastal
                  cities or other densely populated areas, coral reefs face a
                  range of additional challenges. While considerable progress
                  has been made in understanding coral responses to acute
                  individual stressors (Dominoni et al., 2020), the impacts of
                  chronic exposure to varying combinations of sensory pollutants
                  are largely unknown. To investigate the impacts of urban
                  proximity on corals, we conducted a year-long in-natura study
                  - incorporating sampling at diel, monthly, and seasonal time
                  points – in which we compared corals from an Urban area to
                  corals from a proximal Non-Urban area. Here we reveal that
                  despite appearing relatively healthy, natural biorhythms and
                  environmental sensory systems were extensively disturbed in
                  corals from the Urban environment. Transcriptomic data
                  indicated poor symbiont performance, disturbance to
                  gametogenic cycles, and loss or shifted seasonality of vital
                  biological processes. Altered seasonality patterns were also
                  observed in the microbiomes of the Urban coral population,
                  signifying the impact of urbanization on the holobiont, rather
                  than the coral host alone. These results should raise alarm
                  regarding the largely unknown long-term impacts of sensory
                  pollution on the resilience and survival of coral reefs close

                  coral reef ecosystems, which are already threatened by
                  additional global and local level anthropogenic stressors. The
                  effects of ingesting microplastics alone on corals have been
                  well studied, but the effects of the chemical composition of
                  these particles have been understudied. Many
                  microplastic-associated chemicals are endocrine disrupters
                  potentially posing a threat to organismal reproduction.
                  Therefore, the goal of this study was to determine if
                  differences exist between the effects of microplastics
                  themselves and microplastic leachate on Montipora capitata
                  fertilization due to changes in fatty acid quantity and
                  composition. Assays were conducted two years in a row which
                  exposed M. capitata gamete bundles to either one of four types
                  of recently manufactured, virgin microspheres (nylon,
                  polypropylene, high-density polyethylene, or low-density
                  polyethylene) at three concentrations (50, 100, or 200
                  particles/L) or microplastic leachates, presumably including
                  plastic additives from these microspheres. Gamete
                  fertilization was not impacted by microplastic particles
                  themselves, but some of the microplastic leachate treatments
                  with the same polymer type significantly reduced fertilization
                  rates for M. capitata. Additionally, a total of 17 fatty acids
                  were seen in both years, but neither fatty acid quantity nor
                  composition correlated with observed declines in
                  fertilization. Instead, fertilization and fatty acid data
                  independently varied by concentration and polymer type, likely
                  due to the presence of different chemicals. This study is the
                  first to directly test the toxicity of microplastic leachate
                  to coral reproduction. These findings show that
                  microplastic-associated chemicals are an important stressor
                  affecting successful coral fertilization and fatty acid
                  quantity and composition and provide evidence for the negative
                  effects of microplastic leachate to coral reproduction. Thus,
                  plastic additives could pose an additional threat to coral
                  replenishment and persistence in coral reef ecosystems.},

                  have found numerous negative interactions between plastic
                  pollution and marine animals, the effects on embryonic
                  development are poorly understood. A potentially important
                  source of developmental ecotoxicity comes from chemicals
                  leached from plastic particles to the marine environment. Here
                  we investigate the effects of leachates from new and
                  beach-collected pellets on the embryonic and larval
                  development of the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus
                  and demonstrate that exposure of developing embryos to these
                  leachates elicits severe, consistent and treatment-speciﬁc
                  developmental abnormalities including radialisation of the
                  embryo and malformation of the skeleton, neural and immune
                  cells. Using a multi-omics approach we deﬁne the developmental
                  pathways disturbed upon exposure to PVC leachates and provide
                  a mechanistic view that pinpoints cellular redox stress and
                  energy production as drivers of phenotypic abnormalities
                  following exposure to PVC leachates. Analysis of leachates
                  identiﬁed high concentrations of zinc that are the likely
                  cause of these observed defects. Our ﬁndings point to clear
                  and speciﬁc detrimental effects of marine plastic pollution on

                  strong developmental abnormalities via speciﬁc pathways, and
                  therefore have the potential to impact on a wide range of

                  dinoflagellate-algal symbiont Symbiodinium muscatinei was
                  examined following laboratory metal exposures. Both, naturally

                  determined using measures of algal cell density and mitotic
                  index (MI). Anemones were exposed to either cadmium, copper,
                  nickel or zinc chloride (0, 10, 100 microg l(-1) for Cd, Cu
                  and Ni; 0, 100, 1000 microg l(-1) for Zn) for 42 days followed
                  by a 42-day recovery period in ambient seawater. Anemones were
                  analyzed for metal content using inductively coupled plasma
                  mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) at various time points during the
                  study. Symbiotic anemones accumulated Cd, Ni and Zn to a
                  greater extent than aposymbiotic anemones. A dramatically
                  different pattern of Cu accumulation was observed, with
                  aposymbiotic anemones accumulating higher levels than
                  symbiotic anemones. Following recovery in ambient seawater,
                  all tissue metal levels were reduced to near pre-exposure
                  control levels in most cases. No changes in algal cell density
                  or MI were observed in symbiotic anemone tentacle clips at any
                  dose or time point in the Cd and Cu exposures. However,
                  significant reductions in algal cell densities were observed
                  in the Ni-exposed and some Zn-exposed animals, although levels
                  returned to control values following recovery. There were no
                  changes in mitotic index (MI) following Ni or Zn exposures.
                  These results demonstrate that the extent of heavy metal

                  there are potential costs of hosting symbionts, such as the
                  production of reactive oxygen species. We compared the
                  photophysiology and H2O2 production rates of Symbiodinium
                  muscatinei and Elliptochloris marina, the dinoﬂagellate and
                  chlorophyte symbionts, respectively, of the temperate sea
                  anemone Anthopleura elegantissima. Analyses of photosystem II
                  (PSII) function in the two symbionts, including maximum
                  quantum yield and relative electron transport rates, were
                  consistent with prior studies indicating that E. marina has
                  lower photosynthetic performance than S. muscatinei at high
                  temperature and irradiance. The efﬁciency of PSII in both
                  symbionts was positively affected by the addition of exogenous
                  catalase, suggesting that both symbionts experience
                  H2O2-mediated declines in PSII efﬁciency. We found that S.
                  muscatinei produced more H2O2 than E. marina across all
                  treatments, with the highest production under high light and
                  temperature. Results were similar in experiments involving
                  both isolated symbionts and symbionts residing within intact
                  tentacles, indicating that the potential stress of symbiont
                  isolation was not a signiﬁcant factor biasing our results.
                  Despite the lower typical densities of S. muscatinei relative
                  to E. marina, extrapolations of cell-speciﬁc H2O2 production
                  rates to the intact symbiosis suggest that S. muscatinei
                  imposes a greater H2O2 burden on A. elegantissima. Even with
                  this burden, however, the considerably higher productivity and
                  ﬁtness of S. muscatinei-bearing anemones documented in prior
                  studies suggests that the net beneﬁt of hosting S. muscatinei
                  exceeds that of E. marina.},

                  environments, an evaluation of their toxicity is essential.
                  Microplastics are a heterogeneous set of materials that differ
                  not only in particle properties, like size and shape, but also
                  in chemical composition, including polymers, additives and
                  side products. Thus far, it remains unknown whether the
                  plastic chemicals or the particle itself are the driving
                  factor for microplastic toxicity. To address this question, we
                  exposed Daphnia magna for 21 days to irregular polyvinyl
                  chloride (PVC), polyurethane (PUR) and polylactic acid (PLA)
                  microplastics as well as to natural kaolin particles in high
                  concentrations (10, 50, 100, 500 mg/L, ≤ 59 μm) and different
                  exposure scenarios, including microplastics and microplastics
                  without extractable chemicals as well as the extracted and
                  migrating chemicals alone. All three microplastic types
                  negatively affected the life-history of D. magna. However,
                  this toxicity depended on the endpoint and the material. While
                  PVC had the largest effect on reproduction, PLA reduced
                  survival most effectively. The latter indicates that bio-based
                  and biodegradable plastics can be as toxic as their
                  conventional counterparts. The natural particle kaolin was
                  less toxic than microplastics when comparing numerical
                  concentrations. Importantly, the contribution of plastic
                  chemicals to the toxicity was also plastic type-specific.
                  While we can attribute effects of PVC to the chemicals used in
                  the material, effects of PUR and PLA plastics were induced by
                  the mere particle. Our study demonstrates that plastic
                  chemicals can drive microplastic toxicity. This highlights the
                  importance of considering the individual chemical composition
                  of plastics when assessing their environmental risks. Our
                  results suggest that less studied polymer types, like PVC and
                  PUR, as well as bioplastics are of particular toxicological
                  relevance and should get a higher priority in ecotoxicological
                  studies.},

                  Unfortunately, they are highly threatened by local and global
                  stressors, particularly oil pollutants. This is the first
                  quantitative and qualitative study aimed at assessing the
                  concentration and sources of n-alkanes and POPs (PAHs, PCBs
                  and PCNs) in coral tissues, symbiotic algae (zooxanthellae),
                  reef sediments and seawaters in coral reefs of Lark and Kharg
                  in the Persian Gulf, Iran. This work was conducted on eight
                  species of six genera and three families of hard corals and
                  one family of soft coral. A significant variation in the
                  concentration of ∑30n-alkanes and POPs (∑40PAHs, ∑22PCBs and
                  20PCNs) was found in the decreasing order: zooxanthellae >
                  coral tissue > skeleton > reef sediment > seawater. The
                  bioaccumulation of these compounds was 2-times higher in
                  ahermatypic than in hermatypic corals, among which significant
                  variations were observed in both sites. In Kharg, Porites
                  lutea had the highest mean concentration of ∑30n-alkanes and
                  ∑40PAHs in soft tissue, whereas the lowest values were in
                  Platygyra daedalea. A contrasting trend was documented for
                  ∑22PCBs and 20PCNs, with the highest level reported in soft
                  tissue of P. daedalea and the lowest in P. lutea at Kharg.
                  Compositional pattern of AHs and PAHs demonstrated the
                  predominance of LMW-PAHs and n-alkanes. In skeleton and reef
                  sediments, tetra, penta and tri-CBs were the most abundant
                  PCBs congeners followed by di-CB > hexa-CB > hepta-CB >

                  dealing with differing survival times (times-to-event),
                  especially when not all the subjects continue in the study.
                  "Survival" times need not relate to actual survival with death
                  being the event; the "event" may be any event of interest.

  abstract     = {Research with coral embryos and larvae often requires
                  laborious manual counting and sorting of individual specimens,
                  usually via microscopy. Because many coral species spawn only
                  once per year during a narrow temporal window, sample
                  processing is a time-limiting step for research on the early
                  life-history stages of corals. Flow cytometry, an automated
                  technique for measuring and sorting particles, cells, and
                  cell-clusters, is a potential solution to this bottleneck. Yet
                  most flow cytometers do not accommodate live organisms of the
                  size of most coral embryos (> 250 µm), and sample processing
                  is often destructive. Here we tested the ability of a
                  large-particle flow cytometer with a gentle pneumatic sorting
                  mechanism to process and spectrally sort live and preserved
                  Montipora capitata coral embryos and larvae. Average survival
                  rates of mechanically-sorted larvae were over 90\% and were
                  comparable to those achieved by careful hand-sorting.
                  Preserved eggs and embryos remained intact throughout the
                  sorting process and were successfully sorted based on
                  real-time size and fluorescence detection. In-line
                  bright-field microscopy images were captured for each sample
                  object as it passed through the flow-cell, enabling the
                  identification of early-stage embryos (2-cell to morula
                  stage). Samples were counted and sorted at an average rate of
                  4 s larva-1 and as high as 0.2 s larva-1 for high-density
                  samples. Results presented here suggest that large-particle
                  flow cytometry has the potential to significantly increase
                  efficiency and accuracy of data collection and sample
                  processing during time-limited coral spawning events,
                  facilitating larger-scale and higher-replication studies with

  abstract     = {Organizer activity, once thought to be restricted to
                  vertebrates, has ancient origins. However, among
                  non-bilaterians, it has only been subjected to detailed
                  investigation during embryonic development of the sea anemone,
                  Nematostella vectensis. As a step toward establishing the
                  extent to which findings in Nematostella can be generalized
                  across the large and diverse phylum Cnidaria, we examined the
                  expression of some key organizer and gastrulation genes during
                  the embryonic development of the coral Acropora millepora.
                  Although anemones and corals both belong to the cnidarian
                  class Anthozoa, the two lineages diverged during the Cambrian
                  and the morphological development of Acropora differs in
                  several important respects from that of Nematostella. While
                  the expression patterns of the key genes brachyury, bmp2/4,
                  chordin, goosecoid and forkhead are broadly similar,
                  developmental differences between the two species enable novel
                  observations, and new interpretations of their significance.
                  Specifically, brachyury expression during the flattened
                  prawnchip stage before gastrulation, a developmental
                  peculiarity of Acropora, leads us to suggest that it is the
                  key gene demarcating ectoderm from endoderm in Acropora, and
                  by implication in other cnidarians, whereas previous studies
                  in Nematostella proposed that forkhead plays this role. Other
                  novel observations include the transient expression of
                  Acropora forkhead in scattered ectodermal cells shortly after
                  gastrulation, and in the developing mesenterial filaments,
                  with no corresponding expression reported in Nematostella. In
                  addition, the expression patterns of goosecoid and bmp2/4
                  confirm the fundamental bilaterality of the Anthozoa.},

  abstract     = {Coral embryos are a critical and sensitive period for the
                  early growth and development of coral. Benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) is
                  widely distributed in the ocean and has strong toxicity, but
                  there is little information on the toxic effects to coral
                  embryos exposed to this widespread environmental contaminant.
                  Thus, in this study, we utilized the Illumina Hiseq™ 4000
                  platform to explore the gene response of Acropora hyacinthus
                  embryos under the BaP stress. A total of 130,042 Unigenes were
                  obtained and analyzed, and approximately 37.67\% of those
                  matched with sequences from four different species. In total,
                  2606 Unigenes were up-regulated, and 3872 Unigenes were
                  down-regulated. After Gene Ontology (GO) annotation, the
                  results show that the "cellular process" and "metabolic
                  process" were leading in the category of biological processes,
                  which the "binding" and "catalytic activity" were the most
                  abundant subcategories in molecular function. Based on the
                  Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis, the
                  most differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were enriched, as
                  well as down-regulated in the pathways of oxidative
                  phosphorylation, metabolism of xenobiotics, immune-related
                  genes, apoptosis and human disease genes. At the same time,
                  388,197 of Single-nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) and 6164 of
                  Simple Sequence Repeats (SSRs) were obtained, which can be
                  served as the richer and more valuable SSRs molecular markers
                  in the future. The results of this study can help to better
                  understand the toxicological mechanism of coral embryo exposed
                  to BaP, and it is also essential for the protection and
                  restoration of coral reef ecosystem in the future.},

                  sensitivity of these early life phases to pollution, or their
                  relative susceptibility to certain toxicants compared with
                  established coral colonies. Inhibition of fertilisation and
                  larval metamorphosis of the coral Acropora millepora
                  (Ehrenberg, 1834) was assessed in response to solutions of the
                  antifoulants tributyltin (TBT) and copper (Cu) using
                  laboratory-based bioassays. Nominal concentrations that
                  inhibited 50\% fertilisation and metamorphosis (IC50) were
                  calculated from 4 h fertilisation and 24 h metamorphosis
                  assays and were based on introduced dose. Cu was most potent
                  towards fertilisation with an IC50 of 17.4 micrograms/l. TBT
                  however, proved more toxic to larval metamorphosis having an
                  IC50 of 2.0 micrograms/l. Inert surfaces coated with either
                  Cu- or TBT-based antifouling paint also inhibited
                  fertilisation and metamorphosis. The degree of inhibition was
                  correlated with surface area of the paint coating. These
                  results indicate fertilisation and metamorphosis of coral can
                  be sensitive to active components of antifouling paints.},

                  and its orthologs in other cnidarians and Trichoplax most
                  closely resemble the Gsx and, to a lesser extent, Hox 3/4
                  proteins. Developmental northern blots and in situ
                  hybridisation are consistent in showing that cnox-2Am message
                  appears in the planula larva shortly after the oral/aboral
                  axis is formed following gastrulation. Expression is localised
                  in scattered ectodermal cells with a restricted distribution
                  along the oral/aboral body axis. They are most abundant along
                  the sides of the cylindrical larva, rare in the oral region
                  and absent from the aboral region. These cells, which on
                  morphological grounds we believe to be neurons, are of two
                  types; one tri-or multipolar near the basement membrane and a
                  second extending projections in both directions from a
                  mid-ectodermal nucleus. Anti-RFamide staining reveals neurons
                  with a similar morphology to the cnox-2Am-expressing cells.
                  However, RFamide-expressing neurons are more abundant,
                  especially at the aboral end of the planula, where there is no
                  cnox-2Am expression. The pattern of expression of cnox-2Am
                  resembles that of Gsx orthologs in Drosophila and vertebrates
                  in being expressed in a spatially restricted portion of the
                  nervous system.},

  abstract     = {Survival of pelagic marine larvae is an important determinant
                  of dispersal potential. Despite this, few estimates of larval
                  survival are available. For scleractinian corals, few studies
                  of larval survival are long enough to provide accurate
                  estimates of longevity. Moreover, changes in mortality rates
                  during larval life, expected on theoretical grounds, have
                  implications for the degree of connectivity among reefs and
                  have not been quantified for any coral species. This study
                  quantified the survival of larvae from five broadcast-spawning
                  scleractinian corals (Acropora latistella, Favia pallida,
                  Pectinia paeonia, Goniastrea aspera, and Montastraea
                  magnistellata) to estimate larval longevity, and to test for
                  changes in mortality rates as larvae age. Maximum lifespans
                  ranged from 195 to 244 d. These longevities substantially
                  exceed those documented previously for coral larvae that lack
                  zooxanthellae, and they exceed predictions based on metabolic
                  rates prevailing early in larval life. In addition, larval
                  mortality rates exhibited strong patterns of variation
                  throughout the larval stage. Three periods were identified in
                  four species: high initial rates of mortality; followed by a
                  low, approximately constant rate of mortality; and finally,
                  progressively increasing mortality after approximately 100 d.
                  The lifetimes observed in this study suggest that the
                  potential for long-distance dispersal may be substantially
                  greater than previously thought. Indeed, detection of
                  increasing mortality rates late in life suggests that energy
                  reserves do not reach critically low levels until
                  approximately 100 d after spawning. Conversely, increased
                  mortality rates early in life decrease the likelihood that
                  larvae transported away from their natal reef will survive to
                  reach nearby reefs, and thus decrease connectivity at regional
                  scales. These results show how variation in larval
                  survivorship with age may help to explain the seeming paradox
                  of high genetic structure at metapopulation scales, coupled
                  with the maintenance of extensive geographic ranges observed
                  in many coral species.},

               oceanography and marine ecology in the context of the global
               economy and human population growth. For thousands of years
               humanity has seen the oceans as a mysterious, and limitless,
               source of treasures to be fished, harvested, mined, and salvaged.
               Now accelerating developments in ocean studies offer a new
               understanding of the oceans, their role in a global ecosystem,
               and their vulnerability to threats from human action. Drawing on
               the latest research, this book offers a fascinating tour of the
               complex reaches of our ocean world and points the way toward
               changes that will preserve, rather than squander, the wealth of
               oceans.},

                  faces multiple integration challenges: different forms of
                  knowledge, various stakeholders, policies and sectors need to
                  be taken into account as well as different scales, national
                  borders and the interface of land and sea. MSP already
                  integrates different views such as ecological and
                  jurisdictional. However, there is room for improvement in
                  integrating economic, social and cultural perspectives. Tools
                  to analyse the economic effects of planning decisions are,
                  admittedly, rare. To close this gap, the Spatial Economic
                  Benefit Analysis (SEBA) tool has been developed. The method
                  identifies and maps the spatial distribution of benefits
                  associated with certain maritime uses. Given that statistical
                  data on maritime sectors is not available at the necessary
                  level of detail, the SEBA tool takes a rather unconventional
                  approach. Instead of directly assessing monetary benefits, it
                  identifies beneficiaries and analyses their geographical
                  distribution. In this way, the tool enables MSP practitioners
                  to respond to current and future integration challenges. For
                  the sectors of shipping and offshore wind energy, the tool has
                  been tested on the case of the German Baltic Sea region. The
                  case study reveals strengths and weaknesses in applying the
                  SEBA method in general, as well as with regard to the various
                  integration challenges in MSP.},

                  of laws and planning related to the construction of wind
                  farms. Europe currently leads the way in offshore wind energy
                  (with 84\% of global installations), having achieved technical
                  and commercial maturity, including the first floating wind

                  the establishment of higher feed-in tariffs (FITs), could all

                  wind industry, and the emergence of other novel marine uses
                  such as wave and tidal generators, have upped the ante for
                  spatial planners, as well as consenting and approval
                  authorities in various coastal states. These stakeholders rely
                  on processes such as navigational risk assessments (NRAs) to
                  balance safety and efficiency requirements and to make optimal
                  decisions over use of space. Given the increasingly complex
                  and crowded seascape, however, there are some apprehensions
                  about potential shortcomings in these NRA processes. There is
                  also some concern that these inadequacies may lead to unsafe
                  or inefficient marine spatial use. To understand how NRA
                  processes can be improved further, a literature review is
                  conducted, followed by a survey of respondents who are
                  involved in the planning, consenting and/or approval of

                  the findings of the survey, a list of recommendations is

                  potential for novel product innovation and development while
                  also providing numerous environmental benefits including
                  carbon and nitrogen sequestration and other crucial ecosystem
                  services . One of the most promising and prevalent species
                  under domestic cultivation is Saccharina latissma. Also known
                  as sugar kelp, this abundantly grown cold-water species
                  dominates the edible seaweed market in the United States .
                  This paper provides an in-depth geographical analysis of the
                  current state of the U.S. sugar kelp industry, comparing
                  regional market differences and opportunities for growth in

  abstract     = {Kelp forests are in decline across much of their range due to
                  place-specific combinations of local and global stressors.
                  Declines in kelp abundance can lead to cascading losses of
                  biodiversity and productivity with far-reaching ecological and
                  socioeconomic consequences. The Salish Sea is a hotspot of
                  kelp diversity where many species of kelp provide critical
                  habitat and food for commercially, ecologically, and
                  culturally important fish and invertebrate species. However,
                  like other regions, kelp forests in much of the Salish Sea are
                  in rapid decline. Data gaps and limited long-term monitoring
                  have hampered attempts to identify and manage for specific
                  drivers of decline, despite the documented urgency to protect
                  these important habitats. To address these knowledge gaps, we
                  gathered a focus group of experts on kelp in the Salish Sea to
                  identify perceived direct and indirect stressors facing kelp
                  forests. We then conducted a comprehensive literature review
                  of peer-reviewed studies from the Salish Sea and temperate
                  coastal ecosystems worldwide to assess the level of support
                  for the pathways identified by the experts, and we identified
                  knowledge gaps to prioritize future research. Our results
                  revealed major research gaps within the Salish Sea and
                  highlighted the potential to use expert knowledge for making
                  informed decisions in the region. We found high support for
                  the pathways in the global literature, with variable consensus
                  on the relationship between stressors and responses across
                  studies, confirming the influence of local ecological,
                  oceanographic, and anthropogenic contexts and threshold
                  effects on stressor–response relationships. Finally, we
                  prioritized areas for future research in the Salish Sea. This
                  study demonstrates the value expert opinion has to inform
                  management decisions. These methods are readily adaptable to
                  other ecosystem management contexts, and the results of this
                  case study can be immediately applied to kelp management.},

                  factorial combination of current and 2100-predicted
                  temperature (12 and 16 °C, respectively), pH (8.16 and 7.65,
                  respectively), and two copper levels (no-added-copper and
                  species-specific germination Cu-EC50). Meiospore germination
                  for both species declined by 5–18\% under OA and ambient
                  temperature/OA conditions, irrespective of copper exposure.
                  Germling growth rate declined by >40\%·day−1, and gametophyte

                  recovery under respective pH and temperature treatments,
                  germling growth rates increased by 8–18\%·day−1. The exception

                  tire and road wear particles (TRWPs). Approximately 5.9
                  million tonnes/year of TRWPs are emitted globally, and 12–20\%
                  of emissions generated on roads are transmitted into surface
                  waters, where they can release (i.e., leach) chemical
                  compounds that adversely affect aquatic species. To better
                  understand the ecological risk of TRWPs, an acute,
                  probabilistic ecological risk assessment model was developed
                  and applied. This was a screening-level, conceptual ecological
                  risk assessment (ERA) based on secondary data from published
                  scientific studies. The model was demonstrated using British
                  Columbia (BC) Highway 97 (TRWP source) and Kalamalka Lake
                  (receiving water) in Canada, considering two spatial scenarios
                  with varied highway (HWY) lengths and lake volumes.
                  TRWP-derived chemical leachates considered for ERA were
                  aniline, anthracene (ANT), benzo(a)pyrene (B(a)P),
                  fluoranthene (Fl), mercaptobenzothiazole (MBT), and zinc (Zn).
                  An assumed ‘total TRWP-derived leachate set’ was also
                  assessed, representing all compounds present in tire-derived
                  leachate test solutions. The results indicated the risk to
                  aquatic species in two spatial scenarios. In scenario 1,
                  ecotoxicity risk was high from exposure to TRWP-derived zinc
                  and the total TRWP-derived leachate set. Scenario 2 results
                  indicated acute risk was high from all TRWP-derived chemicals
                  examined, except MBT. This preliminary ecological risk
                  screening provides an early signal that freshwater lakes
                  adjacent to busy highways may be at risk from TRWP
                  contamination, indicating a need for further research. This
                  research is the first ERA of TRWPs in Canada, and the results
                  and methodology provide a foundation for future research and

  abstract     = {Tire wear particle (TWP) contamination is of growing concern
                  as recent studies show the ubiquity and toxicity of this
                  contaminant in various environmental compartments. The
                  multidimensional aspect of TWPs makes it difficult to assess
                  toxicity and predict impacts on ecosystems, as it combines a
                  complex mixture of chemicals and can release micro- and
                  nanoparticles when suspended in water. Our work aimed to shed
                  light on the toxicity of the different components of TWP
                  leachate, namely, the dissolved chemicals and the nanoparticle
                  fractions, on three freshwater model species of different
                  trophic levels: Chlorella vulgaris, Lemna minor, and Daphnia
                  magna. Acute toxicity was observed for all three fractions in
                  D. magna, and an additive effect was observed between the
                  nanoparticles and dissolved chemicals. L. minor experienced
                  phytotoxicity from the dissolved chemicals only with a
                  decrease up to 50\% in photosynthesis efficiency parameters.
                  C. vulgaris showed minor signs of toxicity on apical endpoints
                  in response to each of the fractions. Our study highlights
                  that nanoparticles from TWP leachate that were mostly
                  overlooked in several previous studies are as toxic as
                  dissolved chemicals for the filter-feeder species D. magna,
                  and we also show the toxicity to photosynthesis in aquatic
                  plants.},

                  environmental microplastics (MPs), samples were collected from

                  Marie-Galante (MG) on the second island of the archipelago.
                  These samples have a similar polymer composition with mainly
                  polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP). However, these two
                  samples are very dissimilar with regard to their contamination
                  profile and their toxicity. MPs from MG contain more lead,
                  cadmium and organochlorine compounds while those from PB have
                  higher levels of copper, zinc and hydrocarbons. The leachates

                  zooxanthellae. This value decreases to 17\% when intertidal
                  sea anemones are exposed to air for 15 h during daytime spring
                  low tides, primarily owing to a reduction in photosynthesis by
                  the algae, which are shaded when the anemone retracts its
                  tentacles and contracts its marginal sphincter. Contraction of
                  continually immersed anemones during peak irradiance likewise
                  decreases their photosynthesis. This behavior is primarily in

                  widely diverse taxa, habitats, life forms and growth
                  conditions. The photon-yield values on the basis of absorbed
                  light (ϕa) were remarkably constant among plants possessing
                  the same pathway of photosynthetic CO2 fixation, provided the
                  plants had not been subjected to environmental stress. The
                  mean ϕa value ±SE for 37 C3 species was 0.106±0.001
                  O2·photon-1. The five C4 species exhibited lower photon yields
                  and greater variation than the C3 species (ϕa = 0.0692
                  ±0.004). The ϕa values for the two
                  Crassulacean-acid-metabolism species were similar to those of
                  C3 species. Leaf chlorophyll content had little influence on
                  ϕa over the range found in normal, healthy leaves. Chlorophyll
                  fluorescence characteristics at 77 K were determined for the
                  same leaves as used for the photon-yield measurements.
                  Considerable variation in fluorescence emission both at 692 nm
                  and at 734 nm, was found 1) among the different species; 2)
                  between the upper and lower surfaces of the same leaves; and
                  3) between sun and shade leaves of the same species. By
                  contrast, the ratio of variable to maximum fluorescence
                  emission at 692 nm (FV/FM, 692) remained remarkably constant
                  (The mean value for the C3 species was 0.832±0.004).
                  High-light treatments of shade leaves resulted in a reduction
                  in both ϕa and the FV/FM, 692 ratio. The extent of the
                  reductions increased with time of exposure to bright light. A
                  linear relationship was obtained when ϕa was plotted against
                  FV/FM, 692. The results show that determinations of the photon
                  yield of O2 evolution and the FV/FM, 692 ratio can serve as
                  excellent quantitative measures of photoinhibition of overall
                  photosynthetic energy-conversion system and of photochemistry
                  of photosystem II, respectively. This is especially valuable
                  in field work where it is often impossible to obtain
                  appropriate controls.},

                  significantly differed among trophic levels and/or taxonomic

                  highest levels were observed in vertebrates other than fish
                  (i.e. mammals, birds and reptiles). In contrast, no temporal
                  or geographical differences in MP bioaccumulation were noted,
                  independently of the taxonomic groups. These results confirmed
                  that all marine organisms can ingest and accumulate MPs, but
                  the large variability in body burden within and among the
                  taxonomic groups precludes the opportunity to identify global

                  restoration efforts, but existing methods require greater
                  scalability and optimization. To address these needs, we
                  reared Montipora capitata larvae from Kāne’ohe Bay and raised
                  them in an ex situ facility to examine patterns of growth and

                  previous best practices and manipulating light levels during
                  early life-history stages. Larvae were reared using different
                  stocking densities and settled at varied densities (25, 125,
                  and 225 larvae per plug) on conditioned plugs (1 or 4 wk).
                  Juveniles were raised and tracked under different flow, shade,
                  and light acclimation regimes for 135 d. Results show that

                  survivorship was maximized in high flow and intermediate shade
                  levels, while growth was maximized by low shade environments
                  in both aggregate and individual settlers. Light acclimation

                  Understanding the magnitude of the microplastic problem and

                  environment. This critical issue affects both sea life and
                  human beings since microplastics can enter the food chain and
                  cause several health impacts. Plastic recycling, chemical
                  treatments, incineration and landfill are apparently not the
                  optimum solutions for reducing plastic pollution. Hence, this
                  review presents two newly identified environmentally friendly
                  approaches, plastic biodegradation and bioplastic production
                  using algae, to solve the increased global plastic waste.
                  Algae, particularly microalgae, can degrade the plastic
                  materials through the toxins systems or enzymes synthesized by
                  microalgae itself while using the plastic polymers as carbon
                  sources. Utilizing algae for plastic biodegradation has been
                  critically reviewed in this paper to demonstrate the mechanism
                  and how microplastics affect the algae. On the other hand,
                  algae-derived bioplastics have identical properties and
                  characteristics as petroleum-based plastics, while remarkably
                  being biodegradable in nature. This review provides new
                  insights into different methods of producing algae-based
                  bioplastics (e.g., blending with other materials and genetic

                  Scallops were exposed to two pCO(2) (365 and 1050 mu atm) and
                  temperature (14 and 21.5 degrees C) conditions in a two-factor
                  experimental design. Simultaneous exposure to high temperature
                  and high pCO(2) reduced shell strength, decreased outer shell

                  diets, scallops exposed to high pCO(2) had higher content of
                  saturated fatty acids, and lower content of polyunsaturated
                  fatty acids suggesting reorganization of fatty acid chains to
                  sustain basic metabolic functions under high pCO(2).

                  including Fast Repetition Rate ﬂuorometry (FRRf) are
                  particularly well suited to examine MPP variability in coastal
                  regions subjected to dynamic spatio-temporal ﬂuctuations in
                  nutrient availability. FRRf determines photosynthesis as an
                  electron transport rate through Photosystem II (ETRPSII),
                  requiring knowledge of an additional parameter, the electron
                  requirement for carbon ﬁxation (KC), to retrieve rates of
                  CO2-ﬁxation. KC strongly depends upon environmental conditions
                  regulating photosynthesis, yet the importance of
                  N-availability to this parameter has not been examined. Here,
                  we use nutrient bioassays to isolate how N (relative to other
                  macronutrients P, Si) regulates KC of phytoplankton
                  communities from the Australian coast during summer, when
                  N-availability is often highly variable. KC consistently
                  responded to N-amendment, exhibiting up to a threefold
                  reduction and hence an apparent increase in the efﬁciency with
                  which electrons were used to drive C-ﬁxation. However, the
                  process driving this consistent reduction was dependent upon
                  initial conditions. When diatoms dominated assemblages and N
                  was undetectable (e.g., post bloom), KC decreased
                  predominantly via a physiological adjustment of the existing
                  community to N-amendment. Conversely, for mixed assemblages,
                  N-addition achieved a similar reduction in KC through a change
                  in community structure toward diatom domination. We generate
                  new understanding and parameterization of KC that is

  abstract   = {Abiotic conditions (e.g., temperature and pH) fluctuate through
                time in most marine environments, sometimes passing intensity
                thresholds that induce physiological stress. Depending on
                habitat and season, the peak intensity of different abiotic
                stressors can occur in or out of phase with one another. Thus,
                some organisms are exposed to multiple stressors simultaneously,
                whereas others experience them sequentially. Understanding these
                physicochemical dynamics is critical because how organisms
                respond to multiple stressors depends on the magnitude and
                relative timing of each stressor. Here, we first discuss broad
                patterns of covariation between stressors in marine systems at
                various temporal scales. Wethen describe how these dynamics will
                influence physiological responses to multi-stressor exposures.
                Finally, we summarize how multi-stressor effects are currently
                assessed. We find that multi-stressor experiments have rarely
                incorporated naturalistic physicochemical variation into their
                designs, and emphasize the importance of doing so to make
                ecologically relevant inferences about physiological responses

                  bacterial strains (those dominant in disease lesions, absent
                  or rare in healthy tissues and considered potential pathogens
                  in a previous study) were cultured and used to experimentally
                  inoculate otherwise healthy individuals in an attempt to
                  fulfil Henle?Koch's postulates. However, only one (P180R),

                  based on 1.4 kb 16S RNA sequence) to Vibrio tubiashii,

                  experimental infection (which resulted in a 90\% infection

  abstract     = {BACKGROUND: Biological communities are normally composed of a
                  few abundant and many rare species. This pattern is
                  particularly prominent in microbial communities, in which most
                  constituent taxa are usually extremely rare. Although abundant
                  and rare subcommunities may present intrinsic characteristics
                  that could be crucial for understanding community dynamics and
                  ecosystem functioning, microbiologists normally do not
                  differentiate between them. Here, we investigate abundant and
                  rare subcommunities of marine microbial eukaryotes, a crucial
                  group of organisms that remains among the least-explored
                  biodiversity components of the biosphere. We surveyed surface
                  waters of six separate coastal locations in Europe,
                  independently considering the picoplankton, nanoplankton, and
                  microplankton/mesoplankton organismal size fractions. RESULTS:
                  Deep Illumina sequencing of the 18S rRNA indicated that the
                  abundant regional community was mostly structured by
                  organismal size fraction, whereas the rare regional community
                  was mainly structured by geographic origin. However, some
                  abundant and rare taxa presented similar biogeography,
                  pointing to spatiotemporal structure in the rare
                  microeukaryote biosphere. Abundant and rare subcommunities
                  presented regular proportions across samples, indicating
                  similar species-abundance distributions despite taxonomic
                  compositional variation. Several taxa were abundant in one
                  location and rare in other locations, suggesting large
                  oscillations in abundance. The substantial amount of
                  metabolically active lineages found in the rare biosphere
                  suggests that this subcommunity constitutes a diversity
                  reservoir that can respond rapidly to environmental change.
                  CONCLUSIONS: We propose that marine planktonic microeukaryote
                  assemblages incorporate dynamic and metabolically active
                  abundant and rare subcommunities, with contrasting structuring
                  patterns but fairly regular proportions, across space and
                  time.},

                  can leach, migrate or evaporate into indoor air and
                  atmosphere, foodstuff, other materials, etc. Consumer products
                  containing phthalates can result in human exposure through
                  direct contact and use, indirectly through leaching into other
                  products, or general environmental contamination. Humans are
                  exposed through ingestion, inhalation, and dermal exposure
                  during their whole lifetime, including intrauterine
                  development. This paper presents an overview on current risk
                  assessments done by expert panels as well as on exposure
                  assessment data, based on ambient and on current human
                  biomonitoring results. Some phthalates are reproductive and
                  developmental toxicants in animals and suspected endocrine
                  disruptors in humans. Exposure assessment via modelling
                  ambient data give hints that the exposure of children to
                  phthalates exceeds that in adults. Current human biomonitoring
                  data prove that the tolerable intake of children is exceeded
                  to a considerable degree, in some instances up to 20-fold.
                  Very high exposures to phthalates can occur via medical
                  treatment, i.e. via use of medical devices containing DEHP or
                  medicaments containing DBP phthalate in their coating. Because
                  of their chemical properties exposure to phthalates does not
                  result in bioaccumulation. However, health concern is raised

                  marine heatwaves. These changing conditions are directly
                  impacting coral reef ecosystems, which are among the most
                  biodiverse ecosystems on Earth. Coral-associated symbionts are
                  particularly affected because summer heatwaves cause coral
                  bleaching—the loss of endosymbiotic microalgae
                  (Symbiodiniaceae) from coral tissues, leading to coral
                  starvation and death. Coral-associated Symbiodiniaceae and

  abstract     = {There is increasing concern about how microplastics (MPs) are
                  impacting marine ecosystems. In particular, studies on how MPs
                  impact microalgae are required because of the abundance of MPs
                  and importance of green microalgae as primary producers. This
                  study investigated how MPs that are larger (200 μm) than algal
                  cells impact them, using the marine microalga Dunaliella
                  salina as the test species. The microalga was exposed to
                  polyethylene MPs for 6 days. Of interest, the growth and
                  photosynthetic activity of D. salina was enhanced with
                  exposure to MPs, while cell morphology (size and granularity)
                  was not impacted. This phenomenon might be explained by trace
                  concentrations of additive chemicals (endocrine disruptors,
                  phthalates, stabilizers) that possibly leached from MPs
                  promoting the growth and photosynthetic activity of D. salina.
                  We also confirmed that MP size contributes towards determining
                  how plastics affect microalgae. Specifically, as MP size
                  shrinks compared to algal cell size, MPs have increasingly
                  adverse effects. MPs of very small size (like nanoplastics)
                  induce particularly adverse effects on algae. Further studies
                  are required to establish the relationship between algal cell
                  size and MP size.},

                  offered a brand-new springboard for the materials and
                  engineering communities to reshuffle traditional approaches
                  for designing of biopolymers-based composites at ambient

                  to the utilization of thermostable, pressure and chemically
                  resistant biopolymers, found in biologically extreme

                  revealed 191 significantly upregulated and 71 significantly
                  downregulated genes at 7 d after microplastic exposure.
                  Fifteen GO terms were overrepresented for these significantly
                  upregulated genes, which were grouped into four categories
                  including transmembrane ion transport, substrate-specific
                  transmembrane transporter activity, calcium ion binding, and
                  calcium-dependent cysteine-type endopeptidase activity.
                  Thirteen of the significantly upregulated genes encode metal
                  ion transporter and ammonium transporter, and five
                  light-harvesting protein genes were among the significantly
                  downregulated genes. These results demonstrate that
                  microplastics can act as an exogenous stressor, suppress
                  detoxification activity, nutrient uptake, and photosynthesis,
                  elevate oxidative stress, and raise the apoptosis level
                  through upregulating ion transport and apoptotic enzymes to
                  repress the growth of C. goreaui. These effects have
                  implications in negative impacts of microplastics on
                  coral-Symbiodiniaceae symbiosis that involves C. goreaui.},

  abstract  = {In Pollution Is Colonialism Max Liboiron presents a framework for
               understanding scientific research methods as practices that can
               align with or against colonialism. They point out that even when
               researchers are working toward benevolent goals, environmental
               science and activism are often premised on a colonial worldview
               and access to land. Focusing on plastic pollution, the book
               models an anticolonial scientific practice aligned with
               Indigenous, particularly Métis, concepts of land, ethics, and
               relations. Liboiron draws on their work in the Civic Laboratory
               for Environmental Action Research (CLEAR)-an anticolonial science
               laboratory in Newfoundland, Canada-to illuminate how pollution is
               not a symptom of capitalism but a violent enactment of colonial
               land relations that claim access to Indigenous land. Liboiron's
               creative, lively, and passionate text refuses theories of
               pollution that make Indigenous land available for settler and
               colonial goals. In this way, their methodology demonstrates that
               anticolonial science is not only possible but is currently being
               practiced in ways that enact more ethical modes of being in the
               world.},

                  respiration, decomposition, carbon storage, and export rates
                  as fractions of net primary production (NPP) in ecosystems
                  dominated by different types of autotrophs (i.e. oceanic and
                  coastal phytoplankton, microphytobenthos, coral reef algae,
                  macroalgae, seagrasses, marsh plants, and mangroves). A large
                  fraction (>40\%) of the NPP of marine ecosystems is decomposed
                  within the system, except for microphytobenthos
                  (decomposition, ∼25\% of NPP). Herbivory tends to be highest
                  for microalgae (planktonic and benthic, >40\% of NPP) and
                  macroalgae (33.6 ±4.9\% of NPP) and is somewhat less for
                  higher plants. Microphytobenthos export on average a much
                  higher proportion of their NPP than do other microalgal
                  communities, whereas marine macrophytes, except marsh plants,
                  export a substantial proportion (24.3–43.5\% on average) of
                  their NPP. fraction of NPP stored in sediments is 4-fold
                  greater for higher plants (∼10–17\% of NPP) than for algae
                  (0.4–6\% of NPP). On average, ∼90\% of the phytoplankton NPP
                  is used to support local heterotrophic metabolism (i.e. grazed
                  or decomposed). This fraction is even higher in oceanic
                  communities. Mangrove forests, and to a lesser extent seagrass
                  meadows and macroalgal beds, produce organic carbon well in
                  excess of the ecosystem requirements, with excess
                  photosynthetic carbon (i.e. export rate plus storage) in these
                  ecosystem representing ∼40\% of NPP. Extrapolation of these
                  results to the global ocean identifies marine angiosperms,

                  food production, offers a slate of opportunities to mitigate,
                  and adapt to climate change. Seaweed farms release carbon that
                  maybe buried in sediments or exported to the deep sea,
                  therefore acting as a CO2 sink. The crop can also be used, in
                  total or in part, for biofuel production, with a potential CO2
                  mitigation capacity, in terms of avoided emissions from fossil
                  fuels, of about 1,500 tons CO2 km−2 year−1. Seaweed
                  aquaculture can also help reduce the emissions from
                  agriculture, by improving soil quality substituting synthetic
                  fertilizer and when included in cattle fed, lowering methane
                  emissions from cattle. Seaweed aquaculture contributes to
                  climate change adaptation by damping wave energy and
                  protecting shorelines, and by elevating pH and supplying
                  oxygen to the waters, thereby locally reducing the effects of
                  ocean acidification and de-oxygenation. The scope to expand
                  seaweed aquaculture is, however, limited by the availability
                  of suitable areas and competition for suitable areas with
                  other uses, engineering systems capable of coping with rough
                  conditions offshore, and increasing market demand for seaweed
                  products, among other factors. Despite these limitations,

                  benefits, which may, if economically compensated, improve the

                  example of sustainable ﬁsheries management. Yet,
                  sustainability requires more than protection of the biological
                  productivity of the targeted ﬁsh species. It requires
                  preservation of the ﬂows of net social and economic beneﬁts of
                  the ﬁshery, and ﬂexible governance and management institutions
                  that allow for adaptation to changes in ﬁsh abundance as well
                  as changes in consumer demand and in the prices of key inputs.
                  From an economic perspective, the Alaska pollock ﬁshery was
                  unsustainable before passage of the American Fisheries Act
                  (AFA) in 1998. The AFA permanently divided the pollock Total
                  Allowable Catch (TAC) giving a 10\% allocation to the
                  Community Development Quota (CDQ) program and partitioning the
                  remainder among four ﬁshing sectors. It allowed CDQ to be
                  leased to any sector but largely prohibited leasing or sale
                  between other sectors. These limits on intersectoral transfers
                  have reduced the ability of sectors to respond to changes in

                  management measures intended to beneﬁt other species, and
                  changes in the prices of input factors and products. This

                  quotas, facilitate ﬂeet consolidation, and maximize efﬁciency.
                  The changes in efﬁciency and productivity growth arising from
                  the change in management regime have been the subject of
                  several studies, with a few focusing on the large vessels that
                  both catch and process ﬁsh onboard (catcher-processors). This
                  study modiﬁes existing approaches to account for the unique
                  decision making process characterizing catcherprocessor's
                  production technologies. The focus is on sequential decisions
                  regarding what products to produce and the factors that
                  inﬂuence productivity once those decisions are made, using a
                  multiproduct revenue function. The estimation procedure is
                  based on a latent variable econometric model and departs from
                  and advances previous studies since it deals with the mixed
                  distribution nature of the data, a novel application to
                  ﬁsheries production modeling. The resulting productivity
                  growth estimates are consistent with increasing productivity
                  growth since rationalization of the ﬁshery, even in light of
                  large decreases in the pollock stock. These ﬁndings suggest
                  that rationalizing ﬁshery incentives can help foster
                  improvements in economic productivity even during periods of
                  diminished biological productivity.},

                  open access would have deleterious ecological and economic

                  (http://www.fao.org/3/a-i5555e.pdf). After decades of
                  overfishing since industrialization, many global fish stocks
                  have recovered, a change brought about through effective
                  management. We provide a synthetic overview of three
                  approaches that managers use to sustain stocks: regulating
                  catch and fishing mortality, regulating effort and regulating
                  spatial access. Within each of these approaches, we describe
                  common restrictions, how they alter incentives to change
                  fishing behaviour, and the resultant ecological, economic and
                  community-­level outcomes. For each approach, we present
                  prominent case-­studies that illustrate behaviour and the

                  mortality under most conditions, but that additional measures
                  are required to generate economic benefits. Different systems

                  throughout the Indo-Pacific and comprises one of the most
                  important reef-building species in the Hawaiian Islands. Here,
                  we describe a de novo assembly of its genome based on a
                  linked-read sequencing approach developed by 10x Genomics. The
                  final draft assembly consisted of 27,870 scaffolds with a N50
                  size of 186 kb and contained a fairly complete set (81\%) of
                  metazoan benchmarking (BUSCO) genes. Based on haploid assembly
                  size (615 Mb) and read k-mer profiles, we estimated the genome
                  size to fall between 600 and 700 Mb, although the high
                  fraction of repetitive sequence introduced considerable
                  uncertainty. Repeat analysis indicated that 42\% of the
                  assembly consisted of interspersed, mostly unclassified
                  repeats, and almost 3\% tandem repeats. We also identified
                  36,691 protein-coding genes with a median coding sequence
                  length of 807 bp, together spanning 7\% of the assembly. The
                  high repeat content and heterozygosity of the genome proved a
                  challenging scenario for assembly, requiring additional steps
                  to merge haplotypes and resulting in a higher than expected
                  fragmentation at the scaffold level. Despite these challenges,
                  the assembly turned out to be comparable in most quality
                  measures to that of other available coral genomes while being
                  considerably more cost-effective, especially with respect to
                  long-read sequencing methods. Provided high-molecular-weight
                  DNA is available, linked-read technology may thus serve as a
                  valuable alternative capable of providing quality genome
                  assemblies of nonmodel organisms.},

                  differences are not well understood. In this study, we used
                  whole transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) to assess gene
                  expression differences between 27 samples of the coral
                  Montipora capitata predominantly hosting two different
                  Symbiodinium types in clades C and D. The samples were further
                  characterized by their origin from two field sites on Hawai'i
                  Island with contrasting environmental conditions. We found
                  that transcriptome-wide gene expression profiles clearly
                  separated by field site first, and symbiont clade second. With
                  273 differentially expressed genes (DEGs, 1.3\% of all host
                  transcripts), symbiont clade had a measurable effect on host
                  gene expression, but the effect of field site proved almost an
                  order of magnitude higher (1,957 DEGs, 9.6\%). According to
                  SNP analysis, we found moderate evidence for host genetic
                  differentiation between field sites (F-ST = 0.046) and among
                  corals harboring alternative symbiont clades (F-ST = 0.036),
                  suggesting that site-related gene expression differences are
                  likely due to a combination of local adaptation and
                  acclimatization to environmental factors. The correlation
                  between host gene expression and symbiont clade may be due to
                  several factors, including host genotype or microhabitat
                  selecting for alternative clades, host physiology responding
                  to different symbionts, or direct modulation of host gene
                  expression by Symbiodinium. However, the magnitude of these
                  effects at the level of transcription was unexpectedly small

                  future stress can prepare (prime) organismic stress responses
                  even in species lacking a nervous system. The process through
                  which such organisms prepare their phenotype for an improved
                  response to future stress has been termed ‘priming’. However,
                  other terms are also used for this phenomenon, especially when
                  considering priming in different types of organisms and when
                  referring to different stressors. Here we propose a conceptual
                  framework for priming of stress responses in bacteria, fungi
                  and plants which allows comparison of priming with other
                  terms, e.g. adaptation, acclimation, induction, acquired
                  resistance and cross protection. We address spatial and
                  temporal aspects of priming and highlight current knowledge
                  about the mechanisms necessary for information storage which
                  range from epigenetic marks to the accumulation of (dormant)
                  signalling molecules. Furthermore, we outline possible
                  patterns of primed stress responses. Finally, we link the
                  ability of organisms to become primed for stress responses
                  (their ‘primability’) with evolutionary ecology aspects and
                  discuss which properties of an organism and its environment
                  may favour the evolution of priming of stress responses.},

                  structure one year before and one year after the bleaching
                  event. The 1998 bleaching event reduced coral species richness

                  interchangeably for this purpose in the literature. Yet, there
                  are few large-scale studies systematically exploring the
                  appropriateness of using these tools interchangeably, and the
                  scale and significance of the differences between them. Here,
                  we compare the performance of 14 differential abundance
                  testing methods on 38 16S rRNA gene datasets with two sample
                  groups. We test for differences in amplicon sequence variants

                  Our findings confirm that these tools identified drastically
                  different numbers and sets of significant ASVs, and that

                  communities of microorganisms. These animal microbiotas often
                  play important roles in normal physiological function and
                  susceptibility to disease; predicting their responses to
                  perturbation represents an essential challenge for
                  microbiology. Most studies of microbiome dynamics test for
                  patterns in which perturbation shifts animal microbiomes from
                  a healthy to a dysbiotic stable state. Here, we consider a
                  complementary alternative: that the microbiological changes
                  induced by many perturbations are stochastic, and therefore
                  lead to transitions from stable to unstable community states.
                  The result is an ‘Anna Karenina principle’ for animal
                  microbiomes, in which dysbiotic individuals vary more in
                  microbial community composition than healthy
                  individuals—paralleling Leo Tolstoy's dictum that “all happy
                  families look alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own
                  way”. We argue that Anna Karenina effects are a common and
                  important response of animal microbiomes to stressors that
                  reduce the ability of the host or its microbiome to regulate
                  community composition. Patterns consistent with Anna Karenina
                  effects have been found in systems ranging from the surface of
                  threatened corals exposed to above-average temperatures, to
                  the lungs of patients suffering from HIV/AIDs. However,
                  despite their apparent ubiquity, these patterns are easily
                  missed or discarded by some common workflows, and therefore
                  probably underreported. Now that a substantial body of
                  research has established the existence of these patterns in
                  diverse systems, rigorous testing, intensive time-series
                  datasets and improved stochastic modelling will help to
                  explore their importance for topics ranging from personalized
                  medicine to theories of the evolution of host–microorganism

                  microbial symbionts. This ‘microbiome’ possesses the requisite
                  functional diversity to conduct a range of nitrogen (N)
                  transformations including denitrification, nitrification,
                  nitrogen fixation and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to
                  ammonium (DNRA). Very little direct evidence has been
                  presented to date verifying that these processes are active
                  within tropical corals. Here we use a combination of stable
                  isotope techniques, nutrient uptake calculations and captured
                  metagenomics to quantify rates of nitrogen cycling processes
                  in a selection of tropical scleractinian corals.
                  Denitrification activity was detected in all species, albeit
                  with very low rates, signifying limited importance in
                  holobiont N removal. Relatively greater nitrogen fixation
                  activity confirms that corals are net N importers to reef
                  systems. Low net nitrification activity suggests limited N
                  regeneration capacity; however substantial gross nitrification
                  activity may be concealed through nitrate consumption. Based
                  on nrfA gene abundance and measured inorganic N fluxes, we
                  calculated significant DNRA activity in the studied corals,
                  which has important implications for coral reef N cycling and

                  microorganisms, including endosymbiotic microalgae, bacteria,
                  archaea, and fungi. The metabolic interactions within this
                  symbiotic consortium are fundamental to the ecological success
                  of corals and the unique productivity of coral reef
                  ecosystems. Over the last two decades, scientific efforts have
                  been primarily channelled into dissecting the symbioses
                  occurring in coral tissues. Although easily accessible, this
                  compartment is only 2–3 mm thick, whereas the underlying
                  calcium carbonate skeleton occupies the vast internal volume
                  of corals. Far from being devoid of life, the skeleton
                  harbours a wide array of algae, endolithic fungi,
                  heterotrophic bacteria, and other boring eukaryotes, often
                  forming distinct bands visible to the bare eye. Some of the
                  critical functions of these endolithic microorganisms in coral
                  health, such as nutrient cycling and metabolite transfer,
                  which could enable the survival of corals during thermal
                  stress, have long been demonstrated. In addition, some of

                  understood. In particular, the mechanisms involved (e.g., the
                  role of chemical additives) are still elusive. In this study,
                  we found that plasticizer-containing polyvinyl chloride (PVC)
                  microplastics at 0.5\% (w/w) significantly increased soil
                  NH4+-N content and decreased NO3--N content by up to 91\%, and
                  shaped soil microbiota into a microbial system with more
                  nitrogen-fixing microorganisms (as indicated by nifDHK gene
                  abundance), urea decomposers (ureABC genes and urease
                  activity) and nitrate reducers (nasA, NR, NIT-6 and napAB
                  genes), and less nitrifiers (amoC gene and potential
                  nitrification rate). Exposure to plasticizer alone had a
                  similar effect on soil nitrogen parameters but microplastics
                  of pure PVC polymer (either granule or film) had little effect
                  over 60 days, indicating that phthalate plasticizer released
                  from microplastics was the main driver of effects observed.
                  Furthermore, a direct link between phthalate plasticizer,
                  microbial taxonomic changes and altered nitrogen metabolism
                  was established by the isolation of phthalate-degrading
                  bacteria involved in nitrogen cycling. This study highlights
                  the importance of chemical additives in determining the
                  interplay of microplastics with microbes and nutrient cycling,
                  which needs to be considered in future studies.},

                  by the high abundance of ribosomal (r)RNA in bacterial cells.
                  To remove rRNA and enrich coding sequences, subtractive
                  hybridization procedures have become the approach of choice
                  prior to RNA-seq, with their efficiency varying in a manner
                  dependent on sample type and composition. Yet, despite an
                  increasing number of RNA-seq studies, comparative evaluation
                  of bacterial rRNA depletion methods has remained limited.
                  Moreover, no such study has utilized RNA derived from
                  bacterial biofilms, which have potentially higher rRNA:mRNA
                  ratios and higher rRNA carryover during RNA-seq analysis.
                  Presently, we evaluated the efficiency of three subtractive
                  hybridization-based kits in depleting rRNA from samples
                  derived from biofilm, as well as planktonic cells of the

                  results indicated different rRNA removal efficiency for the
                  three procedures, with the Ribo-Zero kit yielding the highest
                  degree of rRNA depletion, which translated into enhanced
                  enrichment of non-rRNA transcripts and increased depth of
                  RNA-seq coverage. The results indicated that, in addition to
                  improving RNA-seq sensitivity, efficient rRNA removal enhanced
                  detection of low abundance transcripts via qPCR. Finally, we
                  demonstrate that the Ribo-Zero kit also exhibited the highest
                  efficiency when P. aeruginosa/Staphylococcus aureus co-culture

                  emerging dominant phthalate contaminant in marine sediments.
                  Macrophthalmus japonicus, an intertidal mud crab, is capable
                  of tolerating variations in water temperature and sudden
                  exposure to toxic substances. To evaluate the potential
                  effects of DEHP toxicity on cellular protection, we
                  characterized the partial open reading frames of the
                  stress-related heat shock protein 60 (HSP60) and small heat
                  shock protein 67B2 (HSP67B2) genes of M. japonicus and further
                  investigated the molecular effects on their expression levels
                  after exposure to DEHP. Putative HSP60 and small HSP67B2
                  proteins had conserved HSP-family protein sequences with
                  different C-terminus motifs. Phylogenetic analysis indicated
                  that M. japonicusHSP60 (Mj-HSP60) and M. Japonicus HSP67B2
                  (Mj-HSP67B2) clustered closely with Eriocheir sinensis HSP60
                  and Penaeus vannamei HSP67B2, respectively. The tissue
                  distribution of Heat shock proteins (HSPs) was the highest in
                  the gonad for Mj-HSP60 and in the hepatopancreas for
                  Mj-HSP67B2. The expression of Mj-HSP60 Messenger Ribonucleic
                  Acid (mRNA) increased significantly at day 1 after exposure to
                  all doses of DEHP, and then decreased in a dose-dependent and
                  exposure time-dependent manner in the gills and
                  hepatopancreas. Mj-HSP67B2 transcripts were significantly
                  upregulated in both tissues at all doses of DEHP and at all
                  exposure times. These results suggest that cellular immune
                  protection could be disrupted by DEHP toxicity through
                  transcriptional changes to HSPs in crustaceans. Small and
                  large HSPs might be differentially involved in responses
                  against environmental stressors and in detoxification in M.

  abstract     = {The Longfin Smelt (Spirinchus thaleichthys) population in the
                  San Franscisco Bay/Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta (Bay-Delta)
                  has declined to ∼1\% of its pre-1980s abundance and, as a
                  result, is listed as threatened under the California
                  Endangered Species Act. The reasons for this decline are
                  multiple and complex, including the impacts of contaminants.
                  Because the spawning and rearing seasons of Longfin Smelt
                  coincide with the rainy season, during which concentrations of
                  contaminants increase due to runoff, we hypothesized that
                  early life stages may be particularly affected by those
                  contaminants. Bifenthrin, a pyrethroid insecticide commonly
                  used in agricultural and urban sectors, is of concern.
                  Concentrations measured in the Bay-Delta have been shown to
                  disrupt the behavior, development, and endocrine system of
                  other fish species. The objective of the present work was to
                  assess the impact of bifenthrin on the early developmental
                  stages of Longfin Smelt. For this, embryos were exposed to 2,
                  10, 100, and 500 ng/L bifenthrin from fertilization to hatch,
                  and larvae were exposed to 2, 10, and 100 ng/L bifenthrin from
                  one day before to 3 days posthatch. We assessed effects on
                  size at hatch, yolk sac volume, locomotory behavior, and upper
                  thermal susceptibility (via cardiac endpoints). Exposure to
                  these environmentally relevant concentrations of bifenthrin
                  did not significantly affect the cardiac function of larval
                  Longfin Smelt; however, exposures altered their behavior and
                  resulted in smaller hatchlings with reduced yolk sac volumes.
                  This study shows that bifenthrin affects the
                  fitness-determinant traits of Longfin Smelt early life stages
                  and could contribute to the observed population decline.},

                  vertebrate hosts, contributing to a number of physiological
                  functions, as well as host ﬁtness. In particular, host
                  immunity is strongly linked to microbiota composition through
                  poorly understood bi-directional links. Gene expression may be
                  a potential mediator of these links between microbial
                  communities and host function. However, few studies have
                  investigated connections between microbiota composition and
                  expression of host immune genes in complex systems. Here, we
                  leverage a large study of laboratory-raised ﬁsh from the
                  species Gasterosteus aculeatus (three-spined stickleback) to
                  document correlations between gene expression and microbiome
                  composition. First, we examined correlations between
                  microbiome alpha diversity and gene expression. Our results
                  demonstrate robust positive associations between microbial
                  alpha diversity and expression of host immune genes. Next, we
                  examined correlations between host gene expression and
                  abundance of microbial taxa. We identiﬁed 15 microbial
                  families that were highly correlated with host gene
                  expression. These families were all tightly correlated with
                  host expression of immune genes and processes, falling into
                  one of three categories—those positively correlated,
                  negatively correlated, and neutrally related to immune
                  processes. Furthermore, we highlight several important immune
                  processes that are commonly associated with the abundance of
                  these taxa, including both macrophage and B cell functions.
                  Further functional characterization of microbial taxa will
                  help disentangle the mechanisms of the correlations described
                  here. In sum, our study supports prevailing hypotheses of

                  Expression of immune genes generally decreased in M. japonicus
                  hepatopancreas and gills exposed to all concentrations of BPA
                  by days 4 and 7. However, at day 1, expression of Serpin and
                  Tryp genes was significantly increased in M. japonicus
                  hepatopancreas and gills exposed to BPA. For DEHP exposure,
                  all genes, with the exception of Serpin, were significantly
                  downregulated in M. japonicus gills. In the hepatopancreas,
                  gene expression of PO, proPO, and LGBP increased at day 1, and
                  then decreased by day 7, while mRNA expression of Serpin and
                  Tryp exhibited up-regulation over all exposure periods. In
                  addition, PE gene expression was upregulated in hepatopancreas
                  at day 7 in a dose-dependent manner. Taken together, these
                  results indicated that the crab immune responses were
                  perturbed by exposure to BPA, and, in particular, DEHP.},

                  placed on the influence of sex and gametogenesis stage when
                  investigating the effects of such stressors. Here, we examined

                  we investigated the gametogenesis cycle and sex-related
                  expression of genes involved in pH homeostasis, stress
                  response and oestrogen receptor-like pathways after the
                  exposure to the two environmental stressors. As expected, we
                  found sex-related differences in the proportion of developing,
                  mature and spawning gonads in histological sections. Male
                  gonads also showed higher levels of the acid–base regulator
                  CA2, but females had a higher expression of stress
                  response-related genes (i.e. sod, cat, hsp70). We found a
                  significant effect of DEHP on stress response-related gene
                  expression that was dependent on the gametogenesis stage, but
                  there was only a trend towards downregulation of CA2 in
                  response to pH 7.7. In addition, differences in gene
                  expression between males and females were most pronounced in
                  experimental conditions containing DEHP and/or acidified pH
                  but never the control, indicating that it is important to
                  consider sex and gametogenesis stage when studying the

                  increasingly abundant throughout the global environment as
                  plastic pollution becomes highly severe, especially in the
                  ocean. The adverse effects of DEHP have garnered increasing
                  concern as they are recognized as endocrine disruptors.
                  However, information on the effects of DEHP in marine
                  organisms remains limited. In this study, acute toxic effects
                  on marine medaka (Oryzias melastigma) following DEHP exposure
                  were investigated. Transcriptome analysis was performed on the
                  livers of medaka exposed to DEHP for 6 and 24 h. Results
                  showed that 1595 genes were affected in all the analyzed
                  specimens, and several genes expressed variably according to
                  sex. Some pathways associated with immunity, metabolism, and
                  endocrine system were significantly enriched, with the
                  complement system appearing to be the most affected immune
                  pathway. Pathway enrichment indicated that, under acute DEHP
                  exposure, the immune response of females tended to be more
                  sensitive than that of males. In addition, ferroptosis
                  occurred in response to DEHP exposure, which resulted in an
                  enrichment of the ferroptosis pathway along with iron
                  overload, an increase in malondialdehyde (MDA) and lipid
                  peroxidation (LPO) content, and a decrease in glutathione
                  (GSH) levels. These results indicate that a form of cell death
                  characterized by iron-dependence occurred following DEHP
                  exposure, but the underlying mechanism requires further
                  analysis. This study implies that DEHP can alter some
                  molecular regulation patterns within a short period and induce
                  cell death through ferroptosis.},

              significant species of red algae occurring in the tropical reef
              ecosystems. They contribute efficiently to the primary
              productivity of the reef and helps in carbon sequestration. They
              act as one of the most suitable substrates for coral larval
              settlement and metamorphosis. Because of their encrusting nature,
              they also cement the reefs together, preventing their subsequent
              degradation. Though numerous studies on taxonomy and barcodes are
              available for this red algal group, genomic studies are mostly
              restricted to a few transcriptomes. The group also lacks a
              reference genome. Porolithon onkodes (Heydrisch) Foslie 1909, is
              one of the most abundant and ecologically important species found
              on the tropical reefs. The authors herewith announce the first
              draft genome of crustose coralline algae. A draft genome of 215 Mb
              size of P. onkodes was assembled from 22 Gb of paired-end raw

                  Porolithon onkodes was reaffirmed as a distinct species, but
                  of variable morphological appearance. The following taxa were
                  found to conform to the present-day diagnosis of P. onkodes
                  and they are thus considered heterotypic synonyms thereof: P.
                  antillarum, P. cocosicum P. pachydermum and P. sandvicense.
                  Despite the suggested reproductive isolation of these taxa,
                  there is no valid taxonomic reason for their separation as the
                  characters considered diagnostic of P. onkodes were found to
                  be present in all of them. Also, while molecular analysis
                  using ITS sequence data has suggested that P. onkodes and P.
                  pachydermum are distinct species, the complex and
                  unpredictable evolutionary behaviour of ITS reduce its use for
                  phylogenetic analysis. In many tropical Indo-Pacific and
                  tropical eastern Atlantic regions, P. onkodes has been
                  reported to be one of the single-most important ecological
                  species because of its wide distribution. Similarly, P.
                  pachydermum has been documented as one of the single-most
                  important ecological species in many areas of the tropical and
                  subtropical western Atlantic. As the two taxa are here shown
                  to be conspecific, it is logical to suggest that P. onkodes is
                  arguably one of the most widespread tropical to subtropical
                  non-geniculate coralline algae. Porolithon onkodes not only
                  occurs largely throughout the Indo-Pacific, but as a result of
                  the present study, is now known to commonly occur throughout
                  the tropical and subtropical regions of the eastern and
                  notably western Atlantic Ocean.},

                  (phthalates). There is a steady and generally accepted opinion
                  that the reason for this is human production activities. The
                  global annual production of phthalic esters is estimated at
                  4.9 million tons. It is believed that part of this amount
                  enters into the environment as a harmful industrial pollutant
                  and has an adverse effect on the health of the human
                  population. However, from a large number of publications it is
                  clear that phthalates, as natural metabolites, are also
                  produced in living nature: bacteria, algae, fungi, plants and
                  other organisms. Dibutyl phthalate and di-2-ethylhexyl
                  phthalate are the main ingredients among natural phthalic acid
                  metabolites. The green cover of the planet simultaneously
                  contains these substances many times more than their annual
                  industrial production. The unicellate inhabitants of the
                  oceans, soils, and other planetary spaces make a big
                  contribution to the phthalates entering in the nature. The
                  lifetime of phthalates in the environment is short and their
                  long-term accumulation is impossible. The observed level of
                  these pollutants in the environment is the result of a dynamic
                  equilibrium process with the participation of natural
                  biosynthesis and industrial production, on the one hand, and
                  biota absorption and natural degradation, on the other. The
                  proportion of biosynthesis and degradation in this equilibrium
                  is seen to be predominant. Therefore, the recommended measures
                  and efforts to limit the production and use of ortho-phthalic
                  acid esters are of little use and make little sense. The
                  observed level is supported by constant feeding from wildlife.
                  Throughout human history, people have received and are
                  receiving phthalates with plant foods without visible
                  consequences. Their harmful effects on the health of the human
                  population are exaggerated. And in the process of evolution,
                  effective endogenous ways of detoxification have been

  author   = {Wells, Christopher},
  date     = {2019-06-14},
  abstract = {Hexacorallians are one of the most conspicuous and dominant
              suspension feeders in temperate and tropical environments. While
              temperate hexacorallians are particularly diverse in the northeast
              Pacific, little work has been done in examining their biology and
              ecology. Within this dissertation, I describe a novel method for
              marking soft-bodied invertebrates such as hexacorallians (Chapter
              1), examine the prey selectivity of the competitively dominant
              anemone Metridium farcimen with DNA metabarcoding (Chapter 2), and
              explore the distribution of the most common hard-bottom
              hexacorallians in the San Juan Archipelago (Chapter 3). In the
              first chapter, I found that both methylene blue and neutral red
              make excellent markers for long-term monitoring of M. farcimen
              with marked individuals identifiable for up to six weeks and seven
              months, respectively. I also found that fluorescein is lethal in
              small dosages to M. farcimen and should not be used as a marker.
              Neutral red could be used for long-term monitoring of growth and
              survival in the field, and in combination with methylene blue
              could be used to mark individuals in distinguishable patterns for
              short-term studies such as examining predator-prey interactions,
              movement of individuals, and recruitment survival. In the second
              chapter, I found that M. farcimen captures a wider variety of prey
              than has been previously described, likely all prey that are large
              enough to detect and that cannot escape. Additionally, comparisons
              between DNA metabarcoding and published results from traditional
              gut sampling techniques showed that many more taxa can be found by
              DNA metabarcoding. Terrestrial prey were surprisingly high in
              abundance within the diet of M. farcimen, likely due to the
              animals living on floating docks. These data highlight the need
              for consideration of space and time in a sampling regime and the
              usefulness of the metabarcoding method in identifying prey within
              the gut of planktivorous animals. In the final chapter, I found
              that depth, light, flow, and substratum slope had significant
              impacts on the distribution of hard-bottom hexacorallians, whereas
              predation pressure and temperature had no detectable effect. Depth
              and light have a strong relationship with algal cover and most
              hexacorallians were conspicuously missing from high algal cover
              surfaces. Additionally, nearly every species increased in density
              with increased flow. These data call attention to the need for
              experimental studies examining the interactions between temperate
              hexacorallians and algae as well the effects of flow on
              distribution of anthozoans.},

                  dinoflagellate algae in the genus Symbiodinium. Bacteria are
                  important to this symbiosis, with diverse functions such as
                  providing nutrients to the symbiont and pathogen protection to
                  the cnidarian. Disrupted bacterial communities are associated
                  with thermally stressed cnidarians, which have a higher
                  likelihood of expelling their symbionts, an event called
                  bleaching. To better understand the association between
                  thermal tolerance and bacterial community structure, we
                  studied communities associated with an exceptionally thermal
                  tolerant cnidarian, Anthopleura elegantissima. This intertidal
                  symbiotic sea anemone is distributed from the subtropical
                  waters of Baja California to subarctic Alaska, and experiences
                  daily temperature fluctuations of up to 20°C. It is also
                  flexible in its symbioses, predominantly hosting Symbiodinium,
                  but occasionally hosting the green algae Elliptochloris marina
                  or existing without symbionts in an aposymbiotic state. We
                  used 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing to characterize the
                  natural variation of microbial communities associated with
                  Anthopleura elegantissima in these three symbiotic states and
                  across a latitudinal gradient. In this study, we identified a
                  core microbiome, made up predominantly of low-abundance taxa.
                  We found that the communities associated with A. elegantissima
                  were weakly linked to latitude. Diversity analyses revealed
                  significantly higher species richness values for microbial
                  communities associated with anemones hosting E. marina. Lastly
                  the microbiome communities associated with different symbiotic
                  states were compositionally distinct. Taken together, our
                  results suggest that the structure of microbial communities
                  associated with these temperate cnidarians is tightly linked
                  to symbiotic state and weakly linked to other biogeographic
                  phenomena.},

                  which are already strongly challenged by climate
                  change-related heat stress. Although it is known that
                  scleractinian corals can ingest microplastic, little is known
                  about their egestion and how microplastic exposure may impair
                  corals at physiological and cellular levels. In addition, the
                  effects of microplastic pollution at current environmental
                  concentration have been little investigated to date,
                  particularly in corals already impacted by heat stress. In
                  this study, the combined effects of these environmental
                  threats on Pocillopora damicornis were investigated from a
                  physical and cellular perspective. Colonies were exposed to
                  three concentrations of polyethylene microplastic beads (no
                  microplastic beads: [No MP], 1 mg/L: [Low MP]; 10 mg/L: [High
                  MP]), and two different temperatures (25 °C and 30 °C) for 72
                  h. No visual signs of stress in corals, such as abnormal mucus
                  production and polyp extroflection, were recorded. At [Low
                  MP], beads adhered to colonies were ingested but were also
                  egested. Moreover, thermally stressed colonies showed a lower
                  adhesion and higher egestion of microplastic beads. Coral
                  bleaching was observed with an increase in temperature and
                  microplastic bead concentration, as indicated by a general
                  decrease in chlorophyll concentration and Symbiodiniaceae
                  density. An increase in lipid peroxidation was measured in
                  colonies exposed to [Low MP] and [High MP] and an
                  up-regulation of stress response gene hsp70 was observed due
                  to the synergistic interaction of both stressors. Overall, our
                  findings showed that heat stress still represents the main
                  threat to P. damicornis, while the effect of microplastics on
                  coral health and physiology may be minor, especially at
                  control temperature. However, microplastics could exacerbate
                  the effect of thermal stress on cellular homeostasis, even at
                  [Low MP]. While reducing ocean warming is critical for
                  preserving coral reefs, effective management of emerging
                  threats like microplastic pollution is equally essential.},

                  in the fish feces (0.20 ± 0.13 pg C cell −1 h −1 ) was
                  significantly lower (93\% less) than that of zooxanthellae
                  freshly isolated from anemones (3.14 ± 0.52 pg C cell −1 h −1

                  zooxanthellae was reduced by 50\% after passage through the

                  predator avoidance and dispersal of viable zoochlorellae that

                  Montipora that have significant biological activities. For
                  example, Montiporic acids A and B and other compounds have
                  been isolated from the adult tissue and eggs of Montipora spp.
                  and have displayed antimicrobial activity and cytotoxicity in
                  cultured cells. The ecological role of these toxic compounds
                  is currently unclear. This study examines the role these
                  toxins play in reproduction. Toxins were found in the eggs and
                  larvae of the coral Montipora capitata. Releasing these toxins
                  by crushing both the eggs and larvae resulted in irreversible
                  inhibition of photosynthesis in endogenous and exogenous
                  zooxanthellae within minutes. Moreover, these toxins were
                  stable, as frozen storage of eggs and larvae did not affect
                  toxicity. Photosynthetic competency of Porites compressa
                  zooxanthellae treated with either frozen or fresh, crushed
                  eggs was inhibited similarly (P > 0.05, ANCOVA). Addition of
                  toxic eggs plugs to live P. compressa fragments caused
                  complete tissue necrosis under the exposed area on the
                  fragments within 1 week. Small volumes of M. capitata crushed
                  eggs added to sperm suspensions reduced in vitro fertilization
                  success by killing the sperm. After 30 min, untreated sperm
                  maintained 90 ± 1.9\% SEM motility while those treated with
                  crushed eggs were rendered immotile, 4 ± 1.4\% SEM. Flow
                  cytometry indicated membrane disruption of the immotile sperm.
                  Fertilization success using untreated sperm was 79 ± 4\% SEM,
                  whereas the success rate dropped significantly after exposure
                  to the crushed eggs, 1.3 ± 0\% SEM. Unlike the eggs and the
                  larvae, M. capitata sperm did not reduce the photosynthetic
                  competency of P. compressa zooxanthellae, suggesting the sperm

                  eggs of the scleractinian corals Porites cylindrica and
                  Montipora digitata to elucidate how zooxanthellae become
                  localized to the endoderm of planulae during the course of
                  development. In both species, zooxanthellae were distributed
                  evenly in the oocytes and delivered almost equally to the
                  blastomeres during cleavage. In P. cylindrica, gastrulation
                  occurred via delamination or ingression, and blastomeres
                  containing zooxanthellae dropped into the blastocoel during
                  gastrulation. Thus, zooxanthellae were restricted to the
                  endodermal cells at the gastrula or early planula stage in P.
                  cylindrica. In M. digitata, gastrulation occurred by a
                  combination of invagination and epiboly to form a somewhat
                  concave gastrula. Zooxanthellae were present in both
                  endodermal and ectodermal cells of early planulae, but they
                  disappeared from the ectoderm as the planulae matured. In our
                  previous study on two species of Pocillopora, we found that
                  zooxanthellae were localized in eggs as well as in embryos,
                  and that blastomeres containing zooxanthellae later dropped
                  into the blastocoel to become restricted to the endoderm
                  (Hirose et al., 2000). The timing and mechanism of
                  zooxanthella localization and types of gastrulation differed
                  among species belonging to the three genera. These results
                  suggest that zooxanthella localization in the embryos reflects
                  the timing of the determination of presumptive endoderm cells
                  and/or specificity of zooxanthellae toward presumptive
                  endoderm cells.},

                  is likely to be critical to understanding the origins and
                  evolution of body axes. Proteins of the decapentaplegic
                  (DPP)/bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) 2/4 subfamily are
                  central to the specification of the dorsoventral (D/V) axis in
                  bilateral animals, albeit with an axis inversion between
                  arthropods and chordates. We show that a dpp/BMP2/4 ortholog
                  (bmp2/4-Am) is present in the reef-building scleractinian
                  coral, Acropora millepora (Class Anthozoa) and that it is
                  capable of causing phenotypic effects in Drosophila that mimic
                  those of the endogenous dpp gene. We also show that, during

                  localized fashion during development. A localized source of
                  DPP/BMP2/4 may have already been used in axis formation in
                  this ancestor, or it may have provided a means by which an

  abstract     = {BACKGROUND: Anthozoan cnidarians are amongst the simplest
                  animals at the tissue level of organization, but are
                  surprisingly complex and vertebrate-like in terms of gene
                  repertoire. As major components of tropical reef ecosystems,
                  the stony corals are anthozoans of particular ecological
                  significance. To better understand the molecular bases of both
                  cnidarian development in general and coral-specific processes
                  such as skeletogenesis and symbiont acquisition, microarray
                  analysis was carried out through the period of early
                  development - when skeletogenesis is initiated, and symbionts
                  are first acquired. RESULTS: Of 5081 unique peptide coding
                  genes, 1084 were differentially expressed (P <or= 0.05) in
                  comparisons between four different stages of coral
                  development, spanning key developmental transitions. Genes of
                  likely relevance to the processes of settlement,
                  metamorphosis, calcification and interaction with symbionts
                  were characterised further and their spatial expression
                  patterns investigated using whole-mount in situ hybridization.
                  CONCLUSION: This study is the first large-scale investigation
                  of developmental gene expression for any cnidarian, and has
                  provided candidate genes for key roles in many aspects of
                  coral biology, including calcification, metamorphosis and
                  symbiont uptake. One surprising finding is that some of these
                  genes have clear counterparts in higher animals but are not
                  present in the closely-related sea anemone Nematostella.
                  Secondly, coral-specific processes (i.e. traits which
                  distinguish corals from their close relatives) may be
                  analogous to similar processes in distantly related organisms.
                  This first large-scale application of microarray analysis
                  demonstrates the potential of this approach for investigating
                  many aspects of coral biology, including the effects of stress
                  and disease.},

                  We followed development of zooxanthella-containing eggs of two
                  such species, Pocillopora verrucosa and P. eydouxi. We also
                  documented changes in the distribution pattern of
                  zooxanthellae during development. Oocytes of both species took
                  up zooxanthellae 3 to 4 days before spawning. At first,
                  zooxanthellae were evenly distributed in oocytes, but they
                  later moved to the hemisphere that contained the germinal
                  vesicle. After fertilization, early cleavage events were
                  holoblastic, progressing by furrow formation. The first
                  cleavage furrow started at the hemisphere that contained
                  zooxanthellae, dividing the zooxanthellate complement of the
                  zygote about equally into the two blastomeres. The second
                  division divided each blastomere into one zooxanthellae-rich
                  cell and one with few zooxanthellae. With continued cell
                  division, blastomeres containing zooxanthellae moved into the
                  blastocoel. The blastocoel disappeared at about 5 h after the
                  first cleavage, and the central region of the embryo was
                  filled with cells containing either zooxanthellae or lipid
                  droplets, forming a stereogastrula. Our results suggest that
                  only blastomeres that had been determined to develop into
                  gastrodermal cells receive zooxanthellae during cleavage. This
                  determination appears to take place, at the latest, by the
                  second cell division at the four-cell stage.},

                  ecosystems, and of significant cultural and economic value
                  worldwide. As anthropogenic and natural stressors are
                  contributing to a global decline of coral reefs, understanding
                  coral health is critical to help preserve these ecosystems.
                  Growth anomaly (GA) is a coral disease that has significant
                  negative impacts on coral biology, yet our understanding of
                  its etiology and pathology is lacking. In this study we used
                  RNA-seq along with de novo metatranscriptome assembly and
                  homology assignment to identify coral genes that are expressed
                  in three distinct coral tissue types: tissue from healthy
                  corals (“healthy”), GA lesion tissue from diseased corals
                  (“GA-affected”) and apparently healthy tissue from diseased
                  corals (“GA-unaffected”). We conducted pairwise comparisons of
                  gene expression among these three tissue types to identify
                  genes and pathways that help us to unravel the molecular
                  pathology of this coral disease. The quality-filtered de
                  novo-assembled metatranscriptome contained 76,063 genes, of
                  which 13,643 were identified as putative coral genes. Overall
                  gene expression profiles of coral genes revealed high
                  similarity between healthy tissue samples, in contrast to high
                  variance among diseased samples. This indicates GA has a
                  variety of genetic effects at the colony level, including on
                  seemingly healthy (GA-unaffected) tissue. A total of 105
                  unique coral genes were found differentially expressed among
                  tissue types. Pairwise comparisons revealed the greatest
                  number of differentially expressed genes between healthy and
                  GA-affected tissue (93 genes), followed by healthy and
                  GA-unaffected tissue (33 genes), and GA-affected and
                  -unaffected tissue (7 genes). The putative function of these
                  genes suggests GA is associated with changes in the activity
                  of genes involved in developmental processes and activation of
                  the immune system. This is one of the first
                  transcriptome-level studies to investigate coral GA, and the

  abstract     = {The class of beta regression models is commonly used by
                  practitioners to model variables that assume values in the
                  standard unit interval (0, 1). It is based on the assumption
                  that the dependent variable is beta-distributed and that its
                  mean is related to a set of regressors through a linear
                  predictor with unknown coeﬃcients and a link function. The
                  model also includes a precision parameter which may be
                  constant or depend on a (potentially diﬀerent) set of
                  regressors through a link function as well. This approach
                  naturally incorporates features such as heteroskedasticity or
                  skewness which are commonly observed in data taking values in
                  the standard unit interval, such as rates or proportions. This
                  paper describes the betareg package which provides the class
                  of beta regressions in the R system for statistical computing.

                  consequence of such sequencing data explosion is the
                  increasing cost and complexity of data processing. The
                  preprocessing of FASTQ data, which means removing adapter
                  contamination, filtering low-quality reads, and correcting
                  wrongly represented bases, is an indispensable but resource
                  intensive part of sequencing data analysis. Therefore,
                  although a lot of software applications have been developed to
                  solve this problem, bioinformatics scientists and engineers
                  are still pursuing faster, simpler, and more energy-efficient

                  greatly improved, making it even faster and more powerful. For
                  instance, the duplication evaluation module has been improved,
                  and a new deduplication module has been added. This study

                  and become mixed with sediment, where benthic invertebrates
                  may encounter and ingest them. Here we show that four species
                  of deposit-feeding and suspension-feeding sea cucumbers
                  (Echinodermata, Holothuroidea) not only ingest small (0.25
                  mm<maximum dimension<15 mm) nylon and polyvinyl chloride (PVC)
                  fragments along with sediment, but also ingest significantly
                  more plastic fragments than predicted given the ratio of
                  plastic to sand grains in the sediment. During four-hour
                  feeding trials, holothurians ingested between 2- and 20-fold
                  more plastic per individual than expected for PVC fragments,
                  and between 2- and 138-fold more for nylon line. In addition,
                  two species ingested 4 mm diameter PVC pellets. The ecological
                  relevance of plastic ingestion was assessed in the laboratory
                  by counting and characterizing small plastic particles
                  discovered in sediment samples from the same field sites where
                  our holothurians were collected. Substantial numbers of
                  plastic fragments (105 to 214 fragments per liter of sediment)
                  were found in samples from three different locations along the
                  east coast of the U.S.A. In addition, plastic collected from
                  the sediment from two of our field sites was analyzed for
                  polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Plastic from one site tested
                  positive for Aroclor 1254 at a concentration of 0.0106 μg g-1.
                  While the negative effects of macroscopic marine plastic
                  debris on a host of organisms are well documented, ingestion
                  of small plastic debris by a wide range of benthic organisms,
                  including both primary and secondary consumers, has received
                  little attention. Given that plastics readily adsorb PCBs and
                  other organic pollutants in marine environments, ingestion of
                  plastic from sediment may provide a heretofore-undescribed
                  pathway of exposure for benthic marine invertebrates.},

                  granules as light is one of the key determinants for coral
                  health. We studied the photophysiology of the oral and aboral
                  symbiont band of scleractinian coral Montastrea curta to
                  investigate if different acclimation to light exist in hospite
                  on a polyp scale. By combined use of electrochemical and
                  fiber-optic microsensors for O2, scalar irradiance and
                  variable chlorophyll fluorescence, we could characterize the
                  physical and chemical microenvironment experienced by the
                  symbionts and, for the first time, estimate effective quantum
                  yields of PSII photochemistry and rates of electron transport
                  at the position of the zooxanthellae corrected for the
                  in-tissue gradient of scalar irradiance. The oral- and aboral
                  Symbiodinium layers received ∼71\% and ∼33\% of surface scalar
                  irradiance, respectively, and the two symbiont layers
                  experience considerable differences in light exposure. Rates
                  of gross photosynthesis did not differ markedly between the
                  oral- and aboral layer and curves of PSII electron transport
                  rates corrected for scalar irradiance in hospite, showed that
                  the light use efficiency under sub-saturating light conditions
                  were similar between the two layers. However, the aboral
                  Symbiodinium band did not experience photosynthetic
                  saturation, even at the highest investigated irradiance where
                  the oral layer was clearly saturated. We thus found a
                  different light acclimation response for the oral and aboral
                  symbiont bands in hospite, and discuss whether such response
                  could be shaped by spectral shifts caused by tissue gradients
                  of scalar irradiance. Based on our experimental finding,
                  combined with previous knowledge, we present a conceptual
                  model on the photophysiology of Symbiodinium residing inside
                  living coral tissue under natural gradients of light and

                  and abiotic changes, little is known about the ability of
                  organisms to adapt or acclimatize to these variables on
                  evolutionarily short time scales and across a variety of
                  habitats. To examine acclimatization across environmental
                  conditions, the plasticity of transcriptional activity related
                  to the heat shock response (HSR) was examined in subtidal
                  populations of the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis at
                  multiple sites along the coast of California, USA. Transcript
                  levels of the constitutive heat shock cognate hsc71 and the
                  inducible isoform hsp70 were observed for field populations at
                  multiple sites along the biogeographic distribution. Field
                  levels of both hsc71 and hsp70 exhibited an inverse
                  relationship with latitude, with the highest transcript
                  abundances in the southern, warm-acclimatized population and
                  lower levels at more northern sites. Up-regulation of the HSR
                  was also characterized for each population via acute
                  temperature exposures across a thermal gradient. In response
                  to these acute thermal challenges, constitutive hsc71
                  transcripts did not significantly up-regulate, while inducible
                  hsp70 transcripts did increase. The temperature of initial
                  hsp70 induction (Ton) varied with latitude, up-regulating at
                  17 °C at the northern-most site, 22.5 °C in central
                  populations, and 25.5 °C for the southern population. However
                  the temperature and abundance of maximal transcription (Tmax)
                  did not vary between sites. Results demonstrate latitudinal
                  acclimatization in M. galloprovincialis, reveal the capacity
                  of the HSR to exhibit different acclimatization patterns, and
                  support the suggestion that elevated levels of hsp70 and hsc71

                  concentration and chlorophyll content. Exposure to the PS
                  leachate did however cause consistent polyp retraction in
                  nubbins over the 5-day exposure. This response was not
                  observed in animals exposed to HBCDD alone, suggesting that

                  of kelp global biogeography has been produced for almost two
                  decades. The circumscription of the order Laminariales and
                  familial and generic relationships in the group have changed
                  considerably recently, in the light of molecular data. A
                  global summary and geographical analysis of kelp species and
                  their distributions (112 species in 33 genera) is presented.
                  These data are analysed and discussed from the perspective of
                  the new consensus of relationships within the group, and
                  likely evolutionary events. The putative ancestors of the
                  kelps occur and are overwhelmingly most diverse, in the cooler
                  waters of northern Japan. The biogeographical evidence
                  suggests three main lines of subsequent evolution: (a) a
                  diversification producing the four ‘derived’ families
                  Alariaceae, Costariceae, Laminariaceae, and Lessoniaceae and
                  most extant genera in the temperate northern Pacific, probably
                  during the Miocene. (b) The evolution of an Arctic flora which
                  invaded the North Atlantic following the opening of the Bering
                  Strait ca. 5.5Ma. (c) At least four separate crossings, by
                  different genera, of tropical regions from Northern to
                  Southern Hemisphere (and one in the opposite direction). The
                  recorded impacts of man on these distributions have thus far
                  been minimal, with the notable exceptions of Undaria
                  pinnatifida and species of Saccharina (grown in aquaculture
                  systems for human food). Most genera are monospecific, with
                  many confined to either the western or eastern temperate North
                  Pacific, whereas the distribution of the most species-rich
                  genera (Alaria, Laminaria, Saccharina) includes the Arctic,
                  and they are widespread in the North Atlantic. This rapid
                  species-level evolution is hypothesised to have been promoted
                  by the relatively recent invasion of the Atlantic by these
                  taxa. The crossing of the tropics has occurred in
                  warm-temperate species some of which occur and are sometimes
                  abundant, in deeper water in today’s tropics, refuting the
                  widespread view that kelps are only present in cold-water
                  habitats. Most of these Southern Hemisphere kelps are in the
                  family Lessoniaceae, including the only genus not present in
                  the Northern Hemisphere, Lessonia. The origins of this genus
                  are unclear. Knowledge of the phylogeography of the
                  Ecklonia/Eisenia complex is particularly important in
                  understanding Southern Hemisphere kelp biogeography. A number
                  of groups are undergoing active speciation and, with the lack
                  of a consistent species concept, the species-level taxonomy of
                  the group remains to be clarified. There is a great need for
                  molecular phylogeographical studies to provide evidence for
                  many of the hypotheses presented here based on distributional
                  evidence and the currently accepted taxonomic framework.

                  occurs along the coasts from Spitsbergen to Portugal,
                  including the Baltic Sea, exhibiting great morphological
                  plasticity. We investigated the morphological and biochemical

                  locations across the species entire distributional range in
                  relation to local abiotic conditions (sea surface temperature,
                  salinity). By statistically linking morphological and
                  biochemical data to geographic information that also took into
                  account the respective sampling depth, we aimed to obtain
                  first insights into the site-specific adaptive features of

                  intraspecific variability among S. latissima sporophytes

                  conspicuous impact of local abiotic factors on specimens’

                  essential for inferring the timing of radiations, the
                  appearance of adaptations, and the historical biogeography of
                  key lineages. In temperate marine ecosystems, kelps
                  (Laminariales) drive productivity and form essential habitat
                  but an incomplete understanding of their phylogeny has limited
                  our ability to infer their evolutionary origins and the
                  spatial and temporal patterns of their diversification. Here,
                  we reconstruct the diversification of habitat-forming kelps
                  using a global genus-level phylogeny inferred primarily from
                  organellar genome datasets, and investigate the timing of kelp
                  radiation. We resolve several important phylogenetic features,
                  including relationships among the morphologically simple kelp
                  families and the broader radiation of complex kelps,
                  demonstrating that the initial radiation of the latter
                  resulted from an increase in speciation rate around the
                  Eocene-Oligocene boundary. This burst in speciation rate is
                  consistent with a possible role of recent climatic cooling in
                  triggering the kelp radiation and pre-dates the origin of
                  benthic-foraging carnivores. Historical biogeographical
                  reconstructions point to a northeast Pacific origin of complex
                  kelps, with subsequent colonization of new habitats likely
                  playing an important role in driving their ecological
                  diversification. We infer that complex morphologies associated
                  with modern kelp forests (e.g. branching, pneumatocysts)
                  evolved several times over the past 15–20 MY, highlighting the
                  importance of morphological convergence in establishing modern
                  upright kelp forests. Our phylogenomic findings provide new
                  insights into the geographical and ecological proliferation of
                  kelps and provide a timeline along which feedbacks between
                  kelps and their food-webs could have shaped the structure of

                  treatments, respectively. The highest C:N ratio was observed
                  in the LN-W treatment. Together, these results seem to suggest
                  that the thready and spring-like shapes found in the central
                  frond (i.e., rougher frond surface) in wave-exposed conditions
                  can at least partly compensate for low nutrient availability
                  by enhancing nutrient and photon acquisition, particularly in
                  low nutrient conditions. Additionally, large individuals
                  showed significantly larger and heavier fronds compared with
                  other size classes, and the meristematic sections of fronds
                  had the most variance in frond surface shapes and highest C:N
                  ratios compared with distal and mid-sections. Together, these
                  results indicate that frond surface shapes in the newly formed
                  central frond of S. latissima can be regarded both as
                  possessing high morphological and physiological plasticity
                  that enables kelp to cope with contrasting environments.},

                  Plastic litter can leach a variety of substances into marine
                  environments; however, virtually nothing is known regarding
                  how this affects photosynthetic bacteria at the base of the
                  marine food web. To address this, we investigated the effect
                  of plastic leachate exposure on marine Prochlorococcus, widely
                  considered the most abundant photosynthetic organism on Earth
                  and vital contributors to global primary production and carbon
                  cycling. Two strains of Prochlorococcus representing distinct
                  ecotypes were exposed to leachate from common plastic items:
                  high-density polyethylene bags and polyvinyl chloride matting.
                  We show leachate exposure strongly impairs Prochlorococcus in
                  vitro growth and photosynthetic capacity and results in
                  genome-wide transcriptional changes. The strains showed
                  distinct differences in the extent and timing of their
                  response to each leachate. Consequently, plastic leachate
                  exposure could influence marine Prochlorococcus community
                  composition and potentially the broader composition and
                  productivity of ocean phytoplankton communities., Sasha Tetu
                  et al. have examined the effects of plastic leachate exposure
                  on the marine bacteria Prochlorococcus, the most abundant

  abstract     = {Synthetic polymer-based materials are ubiquitous in aquatic
                  environments, where weathering processes lead to their
                  progressive fragmentation and the leaching of additive
                  chemicals. The current study assessed the chemical content of
                  freshwater and marine leachates produced from car tire rubber
                  (CTR), polypropylene (PP), polyethylene terephthalate (PET),
                  polystyrene (PS) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) microplastics,
                  and their adverse effects on the microalgae Raphidocelis
                  subcapitata (freshwater) and Skeletonema costatum (marine) and
                  the Mediterranean mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis. A
                  combination of non-target and target chemical analysis
                  revealed a number of organic and metal compounds in the
                  leachates, including representing plasticizers, antioxidants,
                  antimicrobials, lubricants, and vulcanizers. CTR and PVC
                  materials and their corresponding leachates had the highest
                  content of tentatively identified organic additives, while PET
                  had the lowest. The metal content varied both between polymer
                  leachates and between freshwater and seawater. Notable
                  additives identified in high concentrations were benzothiazole
                  (CTR), phthalide (PVC), acetophenone (PP), cobalt (CTR, PET),
                  zinc (CTR, PVC), lead (PP) and antimony (PET). All leachates,
                  except PET, inhibited algal growth with EC50 values ranging
                  from 0.5\% (CTR) and 64\% (PP) of the total leachate
                  concentration. Leachates also affected mussel endpoints,
                  including the lysosomal membrane stability and early stages
                  endpoints as gamete fertilization, embryonic development and
                  larvae motility and survival. Embryonic development was the
                  most sensitive parameter in mussels, with EC50 values ranging
                  from 0.8\% (CTR) to 65\% (PET) of the total leachate. The
                  lowest impacts were induced on D-shell larvae survival,
                  reflecting their ability to down-regulate motility and
                  filtration in the presence of chemical stressors. This study
                  provides evidence of the relationship between chemical
                  composition and toxicity of plastic/rubber leachates.
                  Consistent with increasing contamination by organic and
                  inorganic additives, the leachates ranged from slightly to
                  highly toxic to mussels and algae, highlighting the need for a
                  better understanding of the overall impact of
                  plastic-associated chemicals on aquatic ecosystems.},

                  ubiquity and the threat they pose to environmental and human
                  health. Critical studies have revealed the abundance of
                  microplastics in nature, while others have tested the impacts
                  of these small plastics on organismal health in the
                  laboratory. Yet, there is often a mismatch between these two
                  areas of research, resulting in major discrepancies and an
                  inability to interpret certain ﬁndings. Here, we focus on
                  several main lines of inquiry. First, even though the majority
                  of environmental microplastics are plastic microﬁbers from
                  textiles, laboratory studies still largely use spherical
                  microbeads. There are also inconsistencies between the
                  measurements of microplastics in the environment as compared
                  to the concentrations that tend to be used in experimental
                  studies. Likewise, the period of exposure occurring in
                  experimental studies and in the environment are vastly
                  different. Lastly, although experimental studies often focus
                  on a particular subset of toxic chemicals present on
                  microplastics, textile microﬁbers carry other dyes and
                  chemicals that are understudied. They also cause types of
                  physical damage not associated with microspheres. This review
                  will analyze the literature pertaining to these mismatches,
                  focusing on aquatic organisms and model systems, and seek to
                  inform a path forward for this burgeoning area of research.},

                  Earth’s history. At the elemental level, plastics are

                  provide a detailed morphological characterisation of the
                  developmental defects. Likewise, the developmental toxicity of
                  chemicals leached from plastic particles is understudied. The
                  consequences of these developmental effects are likely
                  underestimated, and the effects on ecosystems are unknown.
                  Using the sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus as a model, we
                  studied the effects of leachates of three forms of plastic
                  pellet: new industrial pre-production plastic nurdles, beached
                  pre-production nurdles, and ﬂoating ﬁlters, known as biobeads,
                  also retrieved from the environment. Our chemical analyses
                  show that leachates from beached pellets (biobead and nurdle
                  pellets) and highly plasticised industrial pellets (PVC)
                  contain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and polychlorinated
                  biphenyls, which are known to be detrimental to development
                  and other life stages of animals. We also demonstrate that
                  these microplastic leachates elicit severe, consistent and
                  treatment-speciﬁc developmental abnormalities in P. lividus at
                  embryonic and larval stages. Those embryos exposed to virgin
                  polyethylene leachates with no additives nor environmental
                  contaminants developed normally, suggesting that the
                  abnormalities observed are the result of exposure to either
                  environmentally adsorbed contaminants or pre-existing
                  industrial additives within the polymer matrix. In the light
                  of the chemical contents of the leachates and other
                  characteristics of the plastic particles used, we discuss the
                  phenotypes observed during our study, which include abnormal

  abstract     = {Throughout its geographic range, the temperate-zone anemone
                  Anthopleura elegantissima is the host of one or both of two
                  distinctively different symbiotic microalgae: a dinoflagellate
                  Symbiodinium (zooxanthellae, ZX) and a chlorophyte
                  (zoochlorellae, ZC). Given the broad vertical intertidal and
                  latitudinal range of this anemone, we investigated the role of
                  temperature in determining whether A. elegantissima supports
                  one algal symbiont over the other and whether temperature
                  regulates the observed distributions of natural populations of
                  ZX and ZC. Temperature appears to be a key factor in
                  regulating both the photophysiology and metabolism of this
                  algal–cnidarian association. In anemones containing ZX,
                  neither algal densities nor chlorophyll content varied with
                  temperature (6–24 °C); in contrast, anemones with ZC displayed
                  reduced densities and chlorophyll content at the highest
                  temperature treatment (24 °C). Both ZX and ZC photosynthetic
                  rates were directly related to temperature, as were anemone
                  respiration rates. The higher photosynthetic rates,
                  maintenance of a stable algal density and chlorophyll content,
                  and higher potential contribution of algal carbon toward
                  animal respiration (CZAR) suggest that the ZX are the more
                  viable symbiont as temperature increases, but we suggest
                  alternative reasons why ZC are preserved in this symbiotic
                  association. Elevated temperatures reduce ZC densities and

                  relationship in a negative fashion, presumably due to a higher

  abstract     = {Coral diseases have increased in frequency and intensity
                  around the tropics worldwide. However, in many cases, little
                  is known about their etiology. Montipora white syndrome (MWS)
                  is a common disease affecting the coral Montipora capitata, a
                  major reef builder in Hawai'i. Chronic Montipora white
                  syndrome (cMWS) is a slow-moving form of the disease that
                  affects M. capitata throughout the year. The effects of this
                  chronic disease on coral immunology and microbiology are
                  currently unknown. In this study, we use prophenoloxidase
                  immune assays and 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing to
                  characterize the microbiome and immunological response
                  associated with cMWS. Our results show that immunological and
                  microbiological responses are highly localized. Relative to
                  diseased samples, apparently healthy portions of cMWS corals
                  differed in immune activity and in the relative abundance of
                  microbial taxa. Coral tissues with cMWS showed decreased
                  tyrosinase-type catecholase and tyrosinase-type cresolase
                  activity and increased laccase-type activity. Catecholase and
                  cresolase activity were negatively correlated across all
                  tissue types with microbiome richness. The localized effect of
                  cMWS on coral microbiology and immunology is probably an
                  important reason for the slow progression of the disease. This
                  local confinement may facilitate interventions that focus on
                  localized treatments on tissue types. This study provides an
                  important baseline to understand the interplay between the
                  microbiome and immune system and the mechanisms used by corals
                  to manage chronic microbial perturbations associated with
                  white syndrome.},

  abstract     = {Climate change has broad ecological implications for species
                  that rely on sensitive habitats. For some top predators, loss
                  of habitat is expected to lead to cascading behavioral,
                  nutritional, and reproductive changes that ultimately
                  accelerate population declines. In the case of the polar bear
                  (Ursus maritimus), declining Arctic sea ice reduces access to
                  prey and lengthens seasonal fasting periods. We used a novel
                  combination of physical capture, biopsy darting, and visual
                  aerial observation data to project reproductive performance
                  for polar bears by linking sea ice loss to changes in habitat
                  use, body condition (i.e., fatness), and cub production.
                  Satellite telemetry data from 43 (1991–1997) and 38
                  (2009–2015) adult female polar bears in the Baffin Bay
                  subpopulation showed that bears now spend an additional 30 d
                  on land (90 d in total) in the 2000s compared to the 1990s, a
                  change closely correlated with changes in spring sea ice
                  breakup and fall sea ice formation. Body condition declined
                  for all sex, age, and reproductive classes and was positively
                  correlated with sea ice availability in the current and
                  previous year. Furthermore, cub litter size was positively
                  correlated with maternal condition and spring breakup date
                  (i.e., later breakup leading to larger litters), and
                  negatively correlated with the duration of the ice-free period
                  (i.e., longer ice-free periods leading to smaller litters).
                  Based on these relationships, we projected reproductive
                  performance three polar bear generations into the future
                  (approximately 35 yr). Results indicate that two-cub litters,
                  previously the norm, could largely disappear from Baffin Bay
                  as sea ice loss continues. Our findings demonstrate how
                  concurrent analysis of multiple data types collected over long
                  periods from polar bears can provide a mechanistic
                  understanding of the ecological implications of climate
                  change. This information is needed for long-term conservation
                  planning, which includes quantitative harvest risk assessments
                  that incorporate estimated or assumed trends in future
                  environmental carrying capacity.},

                  Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) collected from
                  subsistence hunters can provide important insights and improve
                  management decisions when collected systematically. We report
                  on the results of a TEK survey of subsistence polar bear
                  hunters living in the areas around Tasiilaq and
                  Ittoqqortoormiit, East Greenland. Twenty-ﬁve full-time polar
                  bear hunters were interviewed between December 2014 and March
                  2015 in a conversation-style interview, where a local
                  interviewer ﬂuent in the East Greenlandic dialect asked a
                  series of 55 predetermined questions. The primary goals were
                  to (1) gather Inuit perspectives on polar bear subsistence
                  quotas and hunting strategies, (2) understand how climate
                  change is affecting the polar bear subsistence hunt, and (3)
                  document observed changes in polar bear distribution,
                  abundance, and biology. Approximately 40\% of the Tasiilaq
                  respondents had caught between 10 and 19 polar bears in their
                  lifetime, while 67\% of Ittoqqortoormiit respondents reported
                  lifetime catches of ≥20 bears. In both areas, polar bears were
                  most commonly hunted between February and April. Hunters noted
                  large changes to the climate in the areas where they hunt
                  polar bears. Most hunters reported loss of sea ice, receding
                  glaciers, unstable weather, and warmer temperatures. In
                  Tasiilaq 73\% of the hunters said climate changes had affected
                  the polar bear hunt and in Ittoqqortoormiit about 88\% of
                  respondents reported the same. Hunters indicated that sea ice
                  loss has created more areas of open water so dog sledges have
                  become unsafe for hunting transportation compared to 10–15
                  years ago (reported by 100\% of hunters in Tasiilaq and 80\%
                  in Ittoqqortoormiit). In Ittoqqortoormiit, the distance
                  traveled during polar bear hunting trips has decreased
                  dramatically. In both areas hunters noted that more polar
                  bears are coming into their communities compared to 10–15
                  years ago (81\% of Tasiilaq hunters and 78\% of
                  Ittoqqortoormiit hunters) and pointed to the introduction of
                  quotas and loss of sea ice as potential reasons. This study
                  provides an important perspective on the East Greenland
                  subpopulation of polar bears that can be used to direct
                  science questions and inform management.},

                  ocean, and international organizations call for 30\% coverage
                  by 2030. Although numerous studies show that MPAs produce
                  conservation beneﬁts inside their borders, many MPAs are also
                  justiﬁed on the grounds that they confer conservation beneﬁts
                  to the connected populations that span beyond their borders. A
                  network of MPAs covering roughly 20\% of the Channel Islands
                  National Marine Sanctuary was established in 2003, with a goal
                  of providing regional conservation and ﬁshery beneﬁts. We used
                  a spatially explicit bioeconomic simulation model and a
                  Bayesian difference-in-difference regression to examine the
                  conditions under which MPAs can provide population-level
                  conservation beneﬁts inside and outside their borders and to
                  assess evidence of those beneﬁts in the Channel Islands. As of
                  2017, we estimated that biomass densities of targeted ﬁn-ﬁsh
                  had a median value 81\% higher (90\% credible interval:
                  23–148) inside the Channel Island MPAs than outside. However,
                  we found no clear effect of these MPAs on mean total biomass
                  densities at the population level: estimated median effect was
                  –7\% (90\% credible interval: –31 to 23) from 2015 to 2017.
                  Our simulation model showed that effect sizes of MPAs of <30\%
                  were likely to be difﬁcult to detect (even when they were
                  present); smaller effect sizes (which are likely to be common)
                  were even harder to detect. Clearly, communicating
                  expectations and uncertainties around MPAs is critical to
                  ensuring that MPAs are effective. We provide a novel
                  assessment of the population-level effects of a large MPA
                  network across many different species of targeted ﬁn-ﬁsh, and
                  our results offer guidance for communities charged with
                  monitoring and adapting MPAs.},

                  increasingly implemented, with growing national commitments
                  for MPA expansion. Perhaps the greatest challenge to expanded
                  use of MPAs is the perceived trade-off between protection and
                  food production. Since MPAs can benefit both conservation and
                  fisheries in areas experiencing overfishing and since
                  overfishing is common in many coastal nations, we ask how MPAs
                  can be designed specifically to improve fisheries yields. We
                  assembled distribution, life history, and fisheries
                  exploitation data for 1,338 commercially important stocks to
                  derive an optimized network of MPAs globally. We show that
                  strategically expanding the existing global MPA network to
                  protect an additional 5\% of the ocean could increase future
                  catch by at least 20\% via spillover, generating 9 to 12
                  million metric tons more food annually than in a
                  business-as-usual world with no additional protection. Our

                  driver of MPA design, offering a pathway to strategically
                  conserve ocean areas while securing seafood for the future.},

                  determined the concentrations of polyethylene terephthalate
                  (PET) and polycarbonate (PC) MPs in three meconium and six
                  infant and 10 adult feces samples collected from New York
                  State. PET and PC MPs were found in some meconium samples (at
                  concentration ranges from below the limit of quantiﬁcation
                  [<LOQ] to 12,000 and <LOQ−110 ng/g dry weight, respectively)
                  and all infant stool specimens (PET: 5700−82,000 ng/g, median,
                  36,000 ng/g; PC: 49−2100 ng/g, median, 78 ng/g). They were
                  also found in most (PET) or all (PC) adult stool samples but
                  at concentrations an order of magnitude lower than in infants
                  for PET MPs (<LOQ− 16,000 ng/g, median, 2600 ng/g). The
                  estimated mean daily exposures from the diet of infants to PET
                  and PC MPs were 83,000 and 860 ng/kg body weight per day,

                  study suggests that infants are exposed to higher levels of

                  salmon anaemia virus [ISAV], salmon alphavirus [SAV] and the
                  salmon louse Lepeophtheirus salmonis) shows that increased
                  risk of exposure to neighbouring farms is inversely related to
                  distance from and directly related to biomass at the source of
                  infection. Epidemiological techniques integrating data from
                  oceanography, diagnostics and pathogen shedding rates and
                  viability contribute to improved understanding of pathogen
                  transmission pathways among farms and permit the designation
                  of areas of risk associated with sources of infection.
                  Occupation of an area of risk may increase the likelihood of
                  exposure, infection and disease among susceptible fish.
                  Disease mitigation in mariculture occurs at 2 scales:
                  area-based (coordinated stocking, harvesting and fallowing)
                  and farm-based (vaccination, early pathogen detection,
                  veterinary prescribed treatments and depopulation or early
                  harvest in the event of viral disease). Collectively,
                  implementation of mitigation measures results in virus disease
                  outbreaks of shorter duration with lower mortality and
                  therefore reduces the likelihood of pathogen transmission. In
                  contrast, the mitigation of sea lice transmission is less
                  likely to be effective in some areas due to the loss of
                  parasite sensitivity to therapeutants and to dissemination of
                  larval lice when parasites occur below management thresholds.
                  For wild populations, risk of pathogen spillback is estimated
                  from farm-based epidemiological data; however, validation,
                  particularly for ISAV and SAV, is required using direct
                  surveillance.},

                  manufacturing commenced in the 1950’s, including polymer types
                  infused with diverse additives and fillers. While the negative
                  impacts of plastics are widely reported, particularly on
                  marine vertebrates, impacts on microbial life remain poorly
                  understood. Plastics impact microbiomes directly, exerting
                  toxic effects, providing supplemental carbon sources and
                  acting as rafts for microbial colonisation and dispersal.
                  Indirect consequences include increased environmental shading,
                  altered compositions of host communities and disruption of
                  host organism or community health, hormone balances and immune
                  responses. The isolation and application of plastic-degrading
                  microbes are of substantial interest yet little evidence
                  supports the microbial biodegradation of most high molecular
                  weight synthetic polymers. Over 400 microbial species have
                  been presumptively identified as capable of plastic
                  degradation, but evidence for the degradation of highly
                  prevalent polymers including polypropylene, nylon, polystyrene
                  and polyvinyl chloride must be treated with caution; most
                  studies fail to differentiate losses caused by the leaching or
                  degradation of polymer monomers, additives or fillers. Even
                  where polymer degradation is demonstrated, such as for
                  polyethylene terephthalate, the ability of microorganisms to
                  degrade more highly crystalline forms of the polymer used in
                  commercial plastics appears limited. Microbiomes frequently
                  work in conjunction with abiotic factors such as heat and
                  light to impact the structural integrity of polymers and
                  accessibility to enzymatic attack. Consequently, there remains
                  much scope for extremophile microbiomes to be explored as a
                  source of plastic-degrading enzymes and microorganisms. We
                  propose a best-practice workflow for isolating and reporting
                  plastic-degrading taxa from diverse environmental microbiomes,
                  which should include multiple lines of evidence supporting
                  changes in polymer structure, mass loss, and detection of
                  presumed degradation products, along with confirmation of
                  microbial strains and enzymes (and their associated genes)
                  responsible for high molecular weight plastic polymer
                  degradation. Such approaches are necessary for enzymatic
                  degraders of high molecular weight plastic polymers to be
                  differentiated from organisms only capable of degrading the
                  more labile carbon within predominantly amorphous plastics,
                  plastic monomers, additives or fillers.},

                  harvest is a primary driver of such trait change, has received
                  much attention in the literature and is now commonly
                  considered in fisheries management. The potential for
                  selection on behavioural traits has received less study, but
                  mounting evidence suggests that aggression, foraging behaviour
                  and linked traits can also be affected by fishing. An
                  important phenomenon that has received much less attention is
                  selection on reproductive phenology (i.e., the timing of
                  breeding). The potential for this type of “temporal selection”
                  is widespread because there is often substantial variability
                  in reproductive phenology within fish populations, and
                  fisheries management strategies or fishermen’s behaviours can
                  cause fishing effort to vary greatly over time. For example,
                  seasonal closures may expose only early or late breeding
                  individuals to harvest as observed in a range of marine and
                  freshwater fisheries. Such selection may induce evolutionary
                  responses in phenological traits, but can also have
                  demographic impacts such as shortened breeding seasons and
                  reduced phenotypic diversity. These changes can in turn
                  influence productivity, reduce the efficacy of management,
                  exacerbate ongoing climate-­driven changes in phenology and
                  reduce resilience to environmental change. In this essay, we
                  describe how fisheries management can cause temporal
                  variability in harvest, and describe the types of selection on
                  temporal traits that can result. We then summarize the likely
                  biological consequences of temporally selective fishing on
                  populations and population complexes and conclude by
                  identifying areas for future research.},

              consuming the world's natural resources at a faster rate than they
              can be regenerated. At the same time, it produces large amounts of

                  production systems in the coming decades. However, it is
                  associated with potentially important environmental damages
                  caused by its contribution to eutrophication or climate
                  change, for example. To comprehensively quantify those
                  impacts, life cycle assessment (LCA) studies have been
                  conducted on several seafood farming systems for the past 15
                  years. But, what major ﬁndings and common trends can we draw
                  from this pool of studies? What can we learn to provide
                  recommendations to decision and policymakers in the
                  aquaculture sector? To address these questions, we performed a
                  critical review of 65 LCA studies of aquaculture systems from
                  the open literature. We conducted quantitative analyses to
                  explore which impacts can be identiﬁed as dominating and to
                  compare different types of aquaculture systems. Our results
                  evidenced that the feed production is a key driver for climate
                  change, acidiﬁcation, cumulative energy use and net primary
                  production use, while the farming process is a key driver for
                  eutrophication. We also found that different aquaculture
                  systems and technology components may exert considerably
                  different environmental impacts. Based on identiﬁed patterns
                  and comparisons, we therefore provided speciﬁc recommendations
                  to aquaculture stakeholders for future policy and system
                  development. Overall, the analysis of existing studies
                  demonstrates that important insights can be gained by applying
                  LCA to aquaculture systems, and, to move towards an
                  environmentally sustainable aquaculture sector, we recommend
                  its systematic use in the design of new aquaculture systems or
                  policies, and/or in the evaluation and optimization of
                  existing ones.},

                  spp.) due to a bacterial disease called withering syndrome
                  (WS) have been documented along the northeastern Paciﬁc Ocean.
                  However, observed diﬀerences in species susceptibility to the
                  disease are not well understood. Here, we examined the
                  susceptibility of three temperate abalone species, the cool
                  water (4–14 °C) pinto or northern abalone (Haliotis
                  kamtschatkana), the intermediate water (8–18 °C) red abalone
                  (H. rufescens), and the warm water (12–23 °C) pink abalone (H.
                  corrugata), to experimental WS infection at temperatures
                  facilitating disease proliferation. Mortality data paired with
                  histological and molecular detection of the WS pathogen
                  conﬁrmed that these abalone species exhibit diﬀerent levels of
                  susceptibility to infection and resistance to WS development
                  ranging from high susceptibility and low resistance in pinto
                  abalone to moderate/low susceptibility and resistance in red
                  and pink abalones. The temperature associated with WS induced
                  mortalities also varied among species: pinto abalone died at
                  the lowest experimental temperature (17.32 ± 0.09 °C), while
                  red abalone died at an intermediate temperature (17.96 ± 0.16
                  °C), and pink abalone required the highest temperature (18.84
                  ± 0.16 °C). When data from the current and previous studies
                  were examined, susceptibility to WS was inversely related to
                  phylogenetic distance from white abalone (H. sorenseni), which
                  had the highest susceptibility and lowest resistance of all
                  abalone species tested prior to the current study. These
                  results provide further evidence that an abalone’s thermal
                  optima and phylogenetic relationship can determine its
                  susceptibility to WS; species with cool water evolutionary
                  histories are most susceptible to WS and the most susceptible
                  species appear to be closely related. Diﬀerences among the
                  thermal ranges of abalone species have broad implications for
                  WS disease dynamics and highlight the importance of
                  understanding the mechanisms governing the abalone-WS
                  relationship in order to properly manage declining abalone
                  populations.},

                  larval development, skeletal growth, metabolism and patterns
                  of gene expression using an orthogonal comparison of two

                  pCO 2 significantly reduced larval metabolism and triggered a
                  widespread downregulation of histone encoding genes. pCO 2 but
                  not temperature impaired skeletal growth and reduced the

                  the presence of multiple stressors can modify the stressor
                  effects, yet most work focuses on single stressors and single
                  species. Plant-microbe interactions are a class of species
                  interactions on which ecosystems and agricultural systems
                  depend, yet may be affected by multiple global change
                  stressors. Here, we use duckweed and microbes from its
                  microbiome to model responses of interacting plants and
                  microbes to multiple stressors: climate change and tire wear
                  particles. Climate change is occurring globally, and
                  microplastic tire wear particles from roads now reach many
                  ecosystems. We paired perpendicular gradients of temperature
                  and carbon dioxide (CO2) treatments with factorial
                  manipulation of leachate from tire wear particles and duckweed
                  microbiomes. We found that tire leachate and warmer
                  temperatures enhanced duckweed and microbial growth, but
                  caused effects of microbes on duckweed to become negative.
                  However, induced negative effects of microbes were less than
                  additive with warming and leachate. Without tire leachate, we
                  observed that higher CO2 and temperature induced positive
                  correlations between duckweed and microbial growth, which can
                  strengthen mutualisms. In contrast, with tire leachate, growth
                  correlations were never positive, and shifted negative at
                  lower CO2, again suggesting leachate disrupts this
                  plant-microbiome mutualism. In summary, our results
                  demonstrate that multiple interacting stressors can affect
                  multiple interacting species, and that leachate from tire wear
                  particles could potentially disrupt plant-microbe mutualisms.},

                  having historically evolved over long timescales in relatively
                  constant environmental conditions, with little human
                  influence. Such regions are amongst those most physically
                  altering and biologically threatened by global climate change.
                  In addition, they are increasingly receiving anthropogenic
                  pollution. Microplastic pollution has now been found in these
                  most remote places on earth, far from most human activities.
                  Microplastics can induce complex and wide-ranging physical and
                  chemical effects but little to date is known of their
                  long-term biological impacts. In combination with
                  climate-induced stress, microplastics may lead to enhanced
                  multi-stress impacts, potentially affecting the health and
                  resilience of species and ecosystems. While species in
                  historically populated areas have had some opportunity to
                  adapt to mounting human influence over centuries and
                  millennia, the relatively rapid intensification of widespread
                  anthropogenic activities in recent decades has provided
                  species in previously ‘untouched’ regions little such
                  opportunities. The characteristics of remote ecosystems and
                  the species therein suggest that they could be more sensitive
                  to the combined effects of microplastic pollution, global
                  physical change and other stressors than elsewhere. Here we
                  discuss how species and ecosystems within two remote yet
                  contrasting regions, coastal Antarctica and the deep sea,
                  might be especially vulnerable to harm from microplastic

                  environmental variation and has been suggested to vary
                  seasonally. However, most studies to date, particularly
                  studies on bacterial communities, have examined temporal
                  variation over a time frame of less than 1 year, which is
                  insufficient to establish if microbiome variations are indeed
                  seasonal in nature. The present study focused on expanding our
                  understanding of long-term variability in microbial community
                  composition using two common coral species, Acropora
                  hyacinthus, and Acropora spathulata, at two mid-shelf reefs on
                  the Great Barrier Reef. By sampling over a 2-year time period,
                  this study aimed to determine whether temporal variations
                  reflect seasonal cycles. Community composition of both
                  bacteria and Symbiodiniaceae was characterized through 16S
                  rRNA gene and ITS2 rDNA metabarcoding. We observed significant
                  variations in community composition of both bacteria and
                  Symbiodiniaceae among time points for A. hyacinthus and A.
                  spathulata. However, there was no evidence to suggest that
                  temporal variations were cyclical in nature and represented
                  seasonal variation. Clear evidence for differences in the
                  microbial communities found between reefs suggests that reef
                  location and coral species play a larger role than season in
                  driving microbial community composition in corals. In order to
                  identify the basis of temporal patterns in coral microbial
                  community composition, future studies should employ longer
                  time series of sampling at sufficient temporal resolution to
                  identify the environmental correlates of microbiome variation.},

                  the small-scale marine community that makes the world goes
                  round. Microbial organisms of pro- and eukaryotic origin drive
                  the carbon supply and nutrient cycling, thus are mediating the
                  primary productivity within the world largest ecosystem called
                  ocean. But due to the ocean’s great size and large number of
                  biogeographically habitats, the total of microbial species can
                  hardly be grabbed and therefore their functional roles not
                  fully described. However, recent advances in high-throughput
                  sequencing technologies are revolutionizing our understanding
                  of the marine microbial diversity, ecology and evolution.
                  Nowadays, research questions on species differentiation can be
                  solved with genomic approaches such as metabarcoding, while
                  transcriptomics offers the possibility to assign gene
                  functions even to a single cell, e.g., single-cell
                  transcriptomics. On the other hand, due to the diversified
                  amount of sequencing data, the certainty of a data crisis is
                  currently evolving. Scientists are forced to broaden their
                  view on bioinformatics resources for analysis and data storage
                  in from of, e.g., cloud services, to ensure the data’s
                  exchangeability. Which is why time resources are now shifting

                  eco-evolutionary questions stated in the first place. This
                  review is intended to provide exchange on *omics approaches
                  and key points for discussions on data handling used to
                  decipher the relevant diversity and functions of microbial

                  communities in the future, it is critical to understand the
                  potential for local adaptation and the physiological
                  plasticity of marine organisms throughout their entire life
                  cycle, as some stages may be more vulnerable than others.
                  Coralline algae are ecosystem engineers that play significant
                  functional roles in oceans worldwide and are considered
                  vulnerable to ocean acidification. Using different stages of
                  coralline algae, we tested the hypothesis that populations
                  living in environments with higher environmental variability
                  and exposed to higher levels of pCO(2) would be less affected
                  by high pCO(2) than populations from a more stable environment
                  experiencing lower levels of pCO(2). Our results show that
                  spores are less sensitive to elevated pCO(2) than adults.
                  Spore growth and mortality were not affected by pCO(2) level;
                  however, elevated pCO(2) negatively impacted the physiology
                  and growth rates of adults, with stronger effects in
                  populations that experienced both lower levels of pCO(2) and
                  lower variability in carbonate chemistry, suggesting local
                  adaptation. Differences in physiological plasticity and the
                  potential for adaptation could have important implications for

                  the genetic adaptations and physiological mechanisms to
                  acquire, allocate, and use energy for survival and
                  reproduction. In the Hawaiian Archipelago, the Leptoseris
                  species complex form the most spatially extensive mesophotic
                  coral ecosystem known and provide habitat for a unique
                  community. To study how the ecophysiology of Leptoseris
                  species relates to symbiont-host specialization and understand
                  the mechanisms responsible for coral energy acquisition in
                  extreme low light environments, we examined Symbiodinium
                  (endosymbiotic dinoflagellate) photobiological characteristics
                  and the lipids and isotopic signatures from Symbiodinium and
                  coral hosts over a depth-dependent light gradient (55-7 mu mol
                  photons m(-2) s(-1), 60-132 m). Clear performance differences
                  demonstrate different photoadaptation and photoacclimatization
                  across this genus. Our results also show that flexibility in
                  photoacclimatization depends primarily on Symbiodinium type.
                  Colonies harboring Symbiodinium sp. COI-2 showed significant
                  increases in photosynthetic pigment content with increasing
                  depth, whereas colonies harboring Symbiodinium spp. COI-1 and
                  COI-3 showed variability in pigment composition, yield
                  measurements for photosystem II, as well as size and density
                  of Symbiodinium cells. Despite remarkable differences in
                  photosynthetic adaptive strategies, there were no significant
                  differences among lipids of Leptoseris species with depth.
                  Finally, isotopic signatures of both host and Symbiodinium
                  changed with depth, indicating that coral colonies acquired
                  energy from different sources depending on depth. This study
                  highlights the complexity in physiological adaptations within
                  this symbiosis and the different strategies used by closely
                  related mesophotic species to diversify energy acquisition and

                  Pacific oysters (Crassostrea gigas Thunberg) in Washington
                  State suggest a new spionid polychaete outbreak. To determine
                  the identity of the polychaete causing these blisters, we
                  obtained Pacific oysters from two locations in Puget Sound and
                  examined them for blisters and burrows caused by polychaete
                  worms. Specimens were also obtained from eastern oysters
                  (Crassostrea virginica Gmelin) collected in New York for
                  morphological and molecular comparison. We compared polychaete
                  morphology to original descriptions, extracted DNA and
                  sequenced mitochondrial (cytochrome c oxidase I [mtCOI]) and

                  which can cause physiological stress and compromise the health
                  of marine organisms. While there is increased focus on how
                  these stressors will affect marine species, there is little
                  known regarding how changes in water chemistry will impact the

                  (Mytilus galloprovincialis) and Olympia oysters (Ostrea
                  lurida) in Puget Sound, Washington, a region that experiences
                  naturally low pH, seasonal hypoxia, and is surrounded by
                  urbanized and industrialized areas. Shellfish were held at
                  three sites (Carr Inlet, Point Wells, and Dabob Bay) where
                  oceanographic data was continuously collected using mooring
                  buoys. Using inductively coupled plasma mass-spectrometry
                  (ICP-MS) to measure trace metals in the tissue, we found
                  differences in accumulation of trace metals based on species,
                  location, and shellfish size. Our study found differences
                  between sites in both the mean metal concentrations and
                  variability around the mean of those concentrations in
                  bivalves. However, high metal concentrations in bivalves were
                  not associated with high concentrations of metals in seawater.
                  Metal concentrations in shellfish were associated with size:
                  smaller shellfish had higher concentrations of metals. Carr
                  Inlet at 20 m depth had the smallest shellfish and the highest
                  metal concentrations. While we could not eliminate possible
                  confounding factors, we also found higher metal concentrations
                  in shellfish associated with lower pH, lower temperature, and
                  lower dissolved oxygen (conditions seen at Carr Inlet at 20 m
                  and to a lesser extent at Point Wells at 5 m depth). There
                  were also significant differences in accumulation of metals
                  between oysters and mussels, most notably copper and zinc,
                  which were found in higher concentrations in oysters. These
                  findings increase our understanding of spatial differences in
                  trace metal bioaccumulation in shellfish from Puget Sound. Our
                  results can help inform the Puget Sound aquaculture industry

                  and development, and increased mortality in the larval and
                  adult stages to low pH exposure. Second, statistical analyses
                  were conducted on selected pathways to identify OA thresholds
                  specific to duration, taxa, and depth-related life stage.
                  Exposure to reduced pH led to impaired responses across a
                  range of physiology, behavior, growth and development, and
                  mortality endpoints for both larval and adult stages. Third,
                  through discussions and synthesis, the expert panel identified
                  a set of eight duration-dependent, life stage, and
                  habitat-dependent pH thresholds and assigned each a confidence
                  score based on quantity and agreement of evidence. The
                  thresholds for these effects ranged within pH from 7.20 to
                  7.74 and duration from 7 to 30 days, all of which were
                  characterized with either medium or low confidence. These
                  thresholds yielded a risk range from early warning to lethal
                  impacts, providing the foundation for consistent
                  interpretation of OA monitoring data or numerical ocean model
                  simulations to support climate change marine vulnerability
                  assessments and evaluation of ocean management strategies. As
                  a demonstration, two echinoderm thresholds were applied to
                  simulations of a CCE numerical model to visualize the effects
                  of current state of pH conditions on potential habitat.},

                  represent an ideal model system to understand the evolutionary

                  examined the host–symbiont relationships from the dominant
                  coral genus Leptoseris in mesophotic environments from Hawai‘i
                  collected by submersibles across a depth gradient of 65– 125
                  m. Coral and Symbiodinium genotypes were compared with three
                  distinct molecular markers including coral (COX1–1- rRNA
                  intron) and Symbiodinium (COI) mitochondrial markers and
                  nuclear ITS2. The phylogenetic reconstruction clearly resolved
                  five Leptoseris species, including one species (Leptoseris
                  hawaiiensis) exclusively found in deeper habitats (115–125 m).

                  elements: nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and iron (Fe). The

                  observed large-scale variations in surface ocean nutrient
                  concentrations. The ratios in which N, P, and Fe are delivered
                  to the surface ocean, relative to the demands of the

                  driven by predictions for high global demands of important
                  commodities, which require the development of alternative
                  supplies of natural resources. In this study the dynamics of
                  loss of biomass from cultivated Saccharina latissima were
                  studied from February to August 2018 at two kelp farms in
                  Northern (69°45.26′N/019°02.18′E) and in Mid-Norway
                  (63°42.28′N/08°52.23′E). Kelp fronds at each farm were
                  individually followed throughout the growing season. Sectional
                  regression was applied for conversion of measured frond
                  lengths to estimated dry weights. The study shows that between
                  40 and 100\% of all individuals in the studied kelp population
                  constantly eroded slightly from their distal ends. However,
                  until June the accumulated loss was only 8\% of produced dry
                  weight. Due to dislodgement of whole sporophytes this picture
                  changed in July and August to heavy losses in Mid-Norway.
                  Thus, the overall losses of kelp in terms of accumulated dry
                  weight were only 8–13\% of the gross growth until harvest in
                  June in Mid-Norway and August in Northern Norway. Losses
                  increased significantly in Mid-Norway during July and reached
                  49.4\% of the annual production in August. The rates of losses
                  were separated into specific erosion and dislodgement rates.
                  Erosion rates over the whole experimental period for the two
                  sites were not significantly different, while differences in
                  dislodgement rates between farm sites proved to be highly
                  significant. The exported annual amount of carbon was
                  estimated on the basis of lost and measured carbon content in
                  the tissue. From these data a scenario was built for a
                  commercial Norwegian kelp farm growing S. latissima showing a
                  carbon export of 63–88 g C m –2 y –1 . This is eight times
                  less than has been reported from scenarios for kelp farms in
                  China. This study confirms that optimal timing of harvest is
                  the most important management tool for avoidance of heavy
                  losses from kelp farms. In conclusion, an industry with early
                  harvest will likely have a low carbon export, while a
                  late-harvested bulk production could export four to six times
                  as much carbon with an increased potential for carbon
                  sequestration.},

                  disappearance of reef-building corals worldwide. While
                  bleaching episodes significantly impact shallow waters, little
                  is known about their impact on mesophotic coral communities.
                  We studied the prevalence of coral bleaching two to three
                  months after a heat stress event, along an extreme depth range
                  from 6 to 90 m in French Polynesia. Bayesian modelling showed
                  a decreasing probability of bleaching of all coral genera over
                  depth, with little to no bleaching observed at lower
                  mesophotic depths (greater than or equal to 60 m). We found
                  that depth-generalist corals benefit more from increasing
                  depth than depth-specialists (corals with a narrow depth
                  range). Our data suggest that the reduced prevalence of
                  bleaching with depth, especially from shallow to upper
                  mesophotic depths (40 m), had a stronger relation with the
                  light-irradiance attenuation than temperature. While
                  acknowledging the geographical and temporal variability of the
                  role of mesophotic reefs as spatial refuges during thermal
                  stress, we ought to understand why coral bleaching reduces
                  with depth. Future studies should consider repeated monitoring
                  and detailed ecophysiological and environmental data. Our
                  study demonstrated how increasing depth may offer a level of
                  protection and that lower mesophotic communities could escape
                  the impacts of a thermal bleaching event.},

                  negatively influence coral health; however, mechanisms are
                  unknown and most studies have used MP exposure concentrations
                  that are considerably higher than current environmental
                  conditions. Furthermore, whether MP exposure influences coral
                  susceptibility to other stressors such as ocean warming is
                  unknown. Our objective was to determine the physiology
                  response of corals exposed to MP concentrations that have been
                  observed in-situ at ambient and elevated temperature that
                  replicates ocean warming. Here, two sets of short-term
                  experiments were conducted at ambient and elevated
                  temperature, exposing the corals Acropora sp. and Seriatopora
                  hystrix to microspheres and microfibres. Throughout the
                  experiments, gross photosynthesis and net respiration was
                  quantified using a 4-chamber coral respirometer, and
                  photosynthetic yields of photosystem II were measured using
                  Pulse-Amplitude Modulated (PAM) fluorometry. Results indicate
                  the effect of MP exposure is dependent on MP type, coral
                  species, and temperature. MP fibres (but not spheres) reduced
                  photosynthetic capability of Acropora sp., with a 41\%
                  decrease in photochemical efficiency at ambient temperature
                  over 12 days. No additional stress response was observed at
                  elevated temperature; photosynthetic performance significantly
                  increased in Seriatopora hystrix exposed to MP spheres. These
                  findings show that a disruption to coral photosynthetic
                  ability can occur at MP concentrations that have been observed
                  in the marine environment and that MP pollution impact on
                  corals remains an important aspect for further research.},

                  marine plastic pollution is getting increasingly serious due
                  to the large consumption and mismanagement of global plastics.
                  The impact of marine plastics on ecosystem responsible for the

                  environment. Aquatic ecosystems have been studied worldwide,
                  revealing ubiquitous contamination with microplastics.
                  Microalgae, one of the most important primary producers in
                  aquatic ecosystems, could suffer from microplastic
                  contamination, leading to larger impacts on aquatic food webs.
                  Nonetheless, little is known about the toxic effects of
                  microplastics on microalgae populations. Thus, the objective
                  of this review was to identify these effects and the impacts
                  of microplastics on microalgae populations based on currently
                  available literature, also identifying knowledge gaps. Even
                  though microplastics seem to have limited effects on
                  parameters such as growth, chlorophyll content, photosynthesis
                  activity and reactive oxygen species (ROS), current
                  environmental concentrations are not expected to induce
                  toxicity. Even so, microplastics could disrupt population
                  regulation mechanisms, by reducing the availability or
                  absorption of nutrients (bottom-up) or reducing the population
                  of predator species (top-down). Microplastics' properties can
                  also inﬂuence the effects on microalgae, with smaller sizes
                  and positive surface charges having higher toxicity.
                  Therefore, more research is needed to better understand the
                  effects of microplastics on microalgae, such as adaptation
                  strategies, effects on population dynamics and microplastics

                  need for active interventions to halt or reverse the loss of
                  ecological function. Restoration has historically been a key
                  tool to reverse habitat loss and restore functions, but the
                  extent to which this will be sufficient under future climates
                  is uncertain. Emerging genetic technologies now provide the
                  ability for restoration to proactively match adaptability of
                  target species to predicted future environmental conditions,
                  which opens up the possibility of boosting resistance to
                  future stress in degraded and threatened habitats. As such,
                  the choice of whether to restore to historical baselines or
                  anticipate the future remains a key decision that will
                  influence restoration success in the face of environmental and
                  climate change. Here, we present an overview of the different
                  motives for restoration – to recover or revive lost or
                  degraded habitats to extant or historical states, or to
                  reinforce or redefine for future conditions. We focus on the
                  genetic and adaptive choices that underpin each option and
                  subsequent consequences for restoration success. These options
                  span a range of possible trajectories, technological advances
                  and societal acceptability, and represent a framework for
                  progressing restoration of marine habitat forming species into
                  the future.},

                  Clinical evidence, experimental models, and epidemiological
                  studies suggest that EDC have major risks for human by
                  targeting different organs and systems in the body. Multiple

                  through estrogen receptors, nuclear receptors and steroidal
                  receptors activation. In this review, different methods by
                  which xenobiotics stimulate signaling pathways and genetic
                  mutation or DNA methylation have been discussed. These methods
                  help to understand the results of xenobiotic action on the

                  Antarctic Peninsula has warmed rapidly with a significant loss
                  of sea ice but the impacts on plankton biodiversity and carbon
                  cycling remain an open question. Here, using a 5-year dataset
                  of eukaryotic plankton DNA metabarcoding, we assess changes in
                  biodiversity and net community production in this region. Our
                  results show that sea-ice extent is a dominant factor
                  influencing eukaryotic plankton community composition,
                  biodiversity, and net community production. Species richness
                  and evenness decline with an increase in sea surface
                  temperature (SST). In regions with low SST and shallow mixed
                  layers, the community was dominated by a diverse assemblage of
                  diatoms and dinoflagellates. Conversely, less diverse plankton
                  assemblages were observed in waters with higher SST and/or
                  deep mixed layers when sea ice extent was lower. A genetic
                  programming machine-learning model explained up to 80\% of the
                  net community production variability at the Western Antarctic
                  Peninsula. Among the biological explanatory variables, the
                  sea-ice environment associated plankton assemblage is the best
                  predictor of net community production. We conclude that
                  eukaryotic plankton diversity and carbon cycling at the
                  Western Antarctic Peninsula are strongly linked to sea-ice

                  coral-associated bacterial communities, pathogen virulence and
                  immune system function. However, the interactive effects of
                  temperature and pathogens on the coral holobiont are poorly
                  understood. Here, we assessed three compartments of the
                  holobiont (host, Symbiodinium and bacterial community) of the
                  coral Montipora aequituberculata challenged with the pathogen
                  Vibrio coralliilyticus and the commensal bacterium
                  Oceanospirillales sp. under ambient (27°C) and elevated (29.5
                  and 32°C) seawater temperatures. Few visual signs of bleaching
                  and disease development were apparent in any of the
                  treatments, but responses were detected in the holobiont
                  compartments. V. coralliilyticus acted synergistically and
                  negatively impacted the photochemical efficiency of
                  Symbiodinium at 32°C, while Oceanospirillales had no
                  significant effect on photosynthetic efficiency. The coral,
                  however, exhibited a minor response to the bacterial
                  challenges, with the response towards V. coralliilyticus being
                  significantly more pronounced, and involving the
                  prophenoloxidase-activating system and multiple immune
                  system-related genes. Elevated seawater temperatures did not
                  induce shifts in the coral-associated bacterial community, but
                  caused significant gene expression modulation in both
                  Symbiodinium and the coral host. While Symbiodinium exhibited
                  an antiviral response and upregulated stress response genes,
                  M. aequituberculata showed regulation of genes involved in
                  stress and innate immune response processes, including immune
                  and cytokine receptor signalling, the complement system,
                  immune cell activation and phagocytosis, as well as molecular
                  chaperones. These observations show that M. aequituberculata
                  is capable of maintaining a stable bacterial community under
                  elevated seawater temperatures and thereby contributes to
                  preventing disease development.},

                  cyanobacteria such as Prochlorococcus must acquire cobalt from
                  seawater and synthesize cobalamin cofactors. Through a series
                  of experiments with Prochlorococcus strain MIT 9215 under
                  cobalt limiting conditions, the mechanism of Prochlorococcus’
                  cobalt uptake was investigated. Due to low quotas,
                  Prochlorococcus MIT 9215 can maintain growth at extremely slow
                  rates of cobalt uptake, circa 1 atom per cell per hour. Cobalt
                  quotas were linearly related to the concentration of inorganic
                  cobalt species, Co0, indicating that the metal binding sites
                  on the transporter are strongly unsaturated with respect to
                  cobalt. When limited by cobalt, Prochlorococcus growth rates
                  decreased at high levels of both Zn and Mn, suggesting that
                  both metals compete with cobalt for the same transporter. This
                  effect was not observed under a wide range of Fe, Cu, and Ni
                  concentrations, although the onset of exponential growth was
                  delayed at high Ni. These observations agree with prior
                  characterizations of the periplasmic manganese binding protein
                  MntC, which is probably the main pathway for inorganic cobalt
                  uptake and the locus for Mn and Zn competitive inhibition. The
                  toxicity of zinc toward cobalt limited Prochlorococcus MIT
                  9215 contrasts with the observation of cobalt-zinc
                  substitution in eukaryotic phytoplankton and is expected to
                  occur at environmentally relevant concentrations of free zinc
                  and cobalt ions. Thus, the ecological success of
                  Prochlorococcus in the modern ocean may depend on access to
                  cobalt complexed by strong organic ligands that are not
                  subject to competitive inhibition by other metals.},

                  temperature stress on photosynthesis in two reef coral
                  species. We quantified the activities of Photosystem II,
                  Photosystem I and whole chain electron transport under
                  combinations of normal and stressful growth temperatures,
                  moderate and high light levels and the presence or absence of
                  feeding of the coral hosts. Our results show that PS1 function
                  is comparatively robust against temperature stress in both
                  species, whereas PS2 and whole chain electron transport are
                  susceptible to temperature stress. In the symbiotic
                  dinoflagellates of Stylophora pistillata the contents of
                  chlorophyll and major photosynthetic complexes were primarily
                  affected by food availability. In Turbinaria reniformis growth
                  temperature was the dominant influence on the contents of the
                  photosynthetic complexes. In both species feeding the host
                  significantly protected photosynthetic function from high
                  temperature stress. Conclusions/Significance: Our findings
                  support the photoinhibition model of coral bleaching and
                  demonstrate that PS1 is not a major site for thermal damage
                  during bleaching events. Feeding mitigates bleaching in two
                  scleractinian corals, so that reef responses to temperature
                  stresses will likely be influenced by the coinciding
                  availabilities of prey for the host.},

                  are a primary means for carbon export in the Southern Ocean, a
                  key area for global pCO 2 drawdown. Viral lysis and grazing
                  have very different effects on microbial community dynamics
                  and carbon export, yet, very little is known about the
                  relative magnitude and ecological impact of viral lysis on
                  natural phytoplankton communities, especially in Antarctic
                  waters. Here, we report on the temporal dynamics and relative
                  importance of viral lysis rates, in comparison to grazing, for
                  Antarctic nano- and pico-sized phytoplankton of varied
                  taxonomy and size over a full productive season. Our results
                  show that viral lysis was a major loss factor throughout the
                  season, responsible for roughly half (58\%) of seasonal
                  phytoplankton carbon losses. Viral lysis appeared critically
                  important for explaining temporal dynamics and for obtaining a
                  complete seasonal mass balance of Antarctic phytoplankton.
                  Group-specific responses indicated a negative correlation
                  between grazing and viral losses in Phaeocystis and
                  picoeukaryotes, while for other phytoplankton groups losses
                  were more evenly spread throughout the season. Cryptophyte
                  mortality was dominated by viral lysis, whereas small diatoms
                  were mostly grazed. Larger diatoms dominated algal carbon flow
                  and a single ‘lysis event’ directed >100\% of daily carbon
                  production away from higher trophic levels. This study
                  highlights the need to consider viral lysis of key Antarctic
                  phytoplankton for a better understanding of microbial
                  community interactions and more accurate predictions of
                  organic matter flux in this climate-sensitive region.},

  abstract     = {Coral bleaching events are increasing with such frequency and
                  intensity that many of the world’s reef-building corals are in
                  peril. Some corals appear to be more resilient after bleaching
                  but the mechanisms underlying their ability to recover from
                  bleaching and persist are not fully understood. We used
                  shotgun proteomics to compare the proteomes of the outer layer
                  (OL) tissue and inner core (IC) tissue and skeleton
                  compartments of experimentally bleached and control (i.e.,
                  non-bleached) colonies of Montipora capitata, a perforate
                  Hawaiian species noted for its resilience after bleaching. We
                  identiﬁed 2,361 proteins in the OL and IC compartments for
                  both bleached and non-bleached individuals. In the OL of
                  bleached corals, 63 proteins were signiﬁcantly more abundant
                  and 28 were signiﬁcantly less abundant compared to the OL of
                  nonbleached corals. In the IC of bleached corals, 22 proteins
                  were signiﬁcantly more abundant and 17 were signiﬁcantly less
                  abundant compared to the IC of non-bleached corals. Gene
                  ontology (GO) and pathway analyses revealed metabolic
                  processes that were occurring in bleached corals but not in
                  non-bleached corals. The OL of bleached corals used the
                  glyoxylate cycle to derive carbon from internal storage
                  compounds such as lipids, had a high protein turnover rate,
                  and shifted reliance on nitrogen from ammonia to nitrogen
                  produced from the breakdown of urea and betaine. The IC of
                  bleached corals compartmentalized the shunting of glucose to
                  the pentose phosphate pathway. Bleached corals increased
                  abundances of several antioxidant proteins in both the OL and
                  IC compartments compared to non-bleached corals. These results

                  were collected from 11 beaches, three sea surface tows, and
                  three seafloor dives. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy
                  identified the polymers of 3551 pieces. Significant
                  differences (p < 0.05) in concentration, types, polymer
                  composition, and weathering were found among four

  abstract     = {Diatoms are a dominant group of eukaryotic phytoplankton that
                  contribute substantially to global primary production and the
                  cycling of important elements such as carbon and nitrogen.
                  Heterotrophic bacteria, including members of the
                  gammaproteobacteria, are commonly associated with diatom
                  populations and may rely on them for organic carbon while
                  potentially competing with them for other essential nutrients.
                  Considering that bacterioplankton drive oceanic release of CO2
                  (i.e., bacterial respiration) while diatoms drive ocean carbon
                  sequestration vial the biological pump, the outcome of such
                  competition could inﬂuence the direction and magnitude of
                  carbon ﬂux in the upper ocean. Nitrate availability is
                  commonly a determining factor for the growth of diatom
                  populations, particularly in coastal and upwelling regions.
                  Diatoms as well as many bacterial species can utilize nitrate,
                  however the ability of bacteria to compete for nitrate may be
                  hindered by carbon limitation. Here we have developed a
                  genetically tractable model system using the pennate diatom
                  Phaeodactylum tricornutum and the widespread heterotrophic
                  bacteria Alteromonas macleodii to examine carbon-nitrogen
                  dynamics. While subsisting solely on P. tricornutum derived
                  carbon, A. macleodii does not appear to be an effective
                  competitor for nitrate, and may in fact beneﬁt the diatom;
                  particularly in stationary phase. However, allochthonous
                  dissolved organic carbon addition in the form of pyruvate
                  triggers A. macleodii proliferation and nitrate uptake,
                  leading to reduced P. tricornutum growth. Nitrate reductase
                  deﬁcient mutants of A. macleodii ( nasA) do not exhibit such
                  explosive growth and associated competitive ability in
                  response to allochthonous carbon when nitrate is the sole
                  nitrogen source, but could survive by utilizing solely P.
                  tricornutum-derived nitrogen. Furthermore, allocthonous carbon
                  addition enables wild-type A. macleodii to rescue nitrate
                  reductase deﬁcient P. tricornutum populations from nitrogen
                  starvation, and RNA-seq transcriptomic evidence supports
                  nitrogen-based interactions between diatoms and bacteria at
                  the molecular level. This study provides key insights into the
                  roles of carbon and nitrogen in phytoplankton-bacteria
                  dynamics and lays the foundation for developing a mechanistic

                  ocean biogeochemistry and climate. At the Southern Ocean sea
                  ice edge in coastal McMurdo Sound, we observed simultaneous
                  cobalamin and iron limitation of surface water phytoplankton
                  communities in late Austral summer. Cobalamin is produced only
                  by bacteria and archaea, suggesting phytoplankton–bacterial
                  interactions must play a role in this limitation. To
                  characterize these interactions and investigate the molecular
                  basis of multiple nutrient limitation, we examined transitions
                  in global gene expression over short time scales, induced by
                  shifts in micronutrient availability. Diatoms, the dominant
                  primary producers, exhibited transcriptional patterns
                  indicative of co-occurring iron and cobalamin deprivation. The
                  major contributor to cobalamin biosynthesis gene expression
                  was a gammaproteobacterial population, Oceanospirillaceae
                  ASP10-02a. This group also contributed significantly to
                  metagenomic cobalamin biosynthesis gene abundance throughout
                  Southern Ocean surface waters. Oceanospirillaceae ASP10-02a
                  displayed elevated expression of organic matter acquisition
                  and cell surface attachment-related genes, consistent with a
                  mutualistic relationship in which they are dependent on
                  phytoplankton growth to fuel cobalamin production. Separate
                  bacterial groups, including Methylophaga , appeared to rely on
                  phytoplankton for carbon and energy sources, but displayed
                  gene expression patterns consistent with iron and cobalamin
                  deprivation. This suggests they also compete with
                  phytoplankton and are important cobalamin consumers.
                  Expression patterns of siderophore- related genes offer
                  evidence for bacterial influences on iron availability as
                  well. The nature and degree of this episodic colimitation
                  appear to be mediated by a series of phytoplankton–bacterial
                  interactions in both positive and negative feedback loops.},

  abstract     = {Phthalate esters (PEs, Phthalates) are environmentally
                  ubiquitous as a result of their extensive use as plasticizers
                  and additives in diverse consumer products. Considerable
                  concern relates to their reported xenoestrogenicity and
                  consequently, microbial-based attenuation of environmental PE
                  concentrations is of interest to combat harmful downstream
                  effects. Fungal PE catabolism has received less attention than
                  that by bacteria, and particularly fungi dwelling within
                  aquatic environments remain largely overlooked in this
                  respect. We have compared the biocatalytic and biosorptive
                  removal rates of di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP) and diethyl
                  phthalate (DEP), chosen to represent two environmentally
                  prominent PEs of differing structure and hydrophobicity, by
                  marine-, freshwater-, and terrestrial-derived fungal strains.
                  Bisphenol A, both an extensively used plastic additive and
                  prominent environmental xenoestrogen, was included as a
                  reference compound due to its well-documented fungal
                  degradation. Partial pathways of DBP metabolization by the
                  ecophysiologically diverse asco- and basidiomycete strains
                  tested were proposed with the help of UPLC-QTOF-MS analysis.
                  Species specific biochemical reaction steps contributing to
                  DBP metabolism were also observed. The involved reactions
                  include initial cytochrome P450-dependent monohydroxylations
                  of DBP with subsequent further oxidation of related
                  metabolites, de-esterification via either hydrolytic cleavage
                  or cytochrome P450-dependent oxidative O-dealkylation,
                  transesterification, and demethylation steps - finally
                  yielding phthalic acid as a central intermediate in all
                  pathways. Due to the involvement of ecophysiologically and
                  phylogenetically diverse filamentous and yeast-like fungi
                  native to marine, freshwater, and terrestrial habitats the
                  results of this study outline an environmentally ubiquitous
                  pathway for the biocatalytic breakdown of plastic additives.
                  Beyond previous research into fungal PE metabolism which
                  emphasizes hydrolytic de-esterification as the primary
                  catabolic step, a prominent role of cytochrome P450
                  monooxygenase-catalyzed reactions is established.},

              conversion in PS II, φNPQ and φNO, which are complementary with
              the quantum yield of photochemical energy conversion, φII. With
              modern PAM fluorometers, like the Dual-PAM-100, these quantum
              yields are calculated online with every Saturation Pulse and
              displayed as the parameters Y(II), Y(NPQ) and Y(NO), the sum of
              which is always unity: Y(II) + Y(NPQ) +Y(NO) = 1. These quantum
              yields comprehensively describe the fate of excitation energy in
              PS II and allow deep insights into the plant's capacity to cope
              with excess excitation energy. While so far calculation of Y(NPQ)
              and Y(NO) by the PAM software has been based on rather complex
              expressions derived by Kramer et al. (2004) Photosynth Res 79:
              209-218, more simple expressions derived by Genty et al. (1996)
              (abstract no P28 of Robert Hill Symposium, Sheffield, UK) were
              advocated by Hendrickson et al. (2004) Photosynth Res 82: 73-81,
              with Y(NO) and Y(NPQ) being expressed by the fluorescence yields
              F, Fm and Fm', measured by PAM fluorometry and the Saturation
              Pulse method: Y(NO) = F/Fm and Y(NPQ) = F/Fm' - F/Fm. Notably
              these expressions do not require knowledge of Fo'. Here we show
              that the expressions of Kramer et al. (2004) can be transformed
              into the simple expressions of Genty et al. (1996) and that these
              are not only valid for a lake model, but also for a puddle model,
              as already known for Y(II) = (Fm'-F)/Fm'. The meaning of Y(NO) is
              discussed and an example of characteristic changes of the

              presented.},

                  impact on natural coral populations. We sought to maximize
                  larval survival while minimizing expense and daily husbandry
                  maintenance by experimentally determining optimized conditions
                  and protocols for gamete fertilization, larval cultivation,
                  induction of larval settlement by crustose coralline algae,
                  and inoculation of newly settled juveniles with their
                  dinoflagellate symbiont Symbiodinium. Larval rearing densities
                  at or below 0.2 larvae mL−1 were found to maximize larval
                  survival and settlement success in culture tanks while
                  minimizing maintenance effort. Induction of larval settlement
                  via the addition of a ground mixture of diverse crustose
                  coralline algae (CCA) is recommended, given the challenging
                  nature of in situ CCA identification and our finding that non
                  settlement-inducing CCA assemblages do not inhibit larval
                  settlement if suitable assemblages are present. Although order
                  of magnitude differences in infectivity were found between
                  common Great Barrier Reef Symbiodinium clades C and D, no

                  plastic particles accumulated in their tissue. Specimens of
                  cf. Haliclona (Haplosclerida) were sampled in the Maldivian

                  coupled with gas chromatography mass spectrometry for those
                  <25 μm. Method recoveries were between 87 and 83\% and limits
                  of quantitation (LOQs) were between 6.6 and 30.2 ng/g.
                  Analyses showed that 70\% of the sponges presented plastic
                  contamination, with an average of 1.2 particles/g tissue for
                  the 25–150 μm size range, and a total plastic concentration of

                  being the most represented polymer in both size ranges.

                  examination of the physiological and molecular responses of
                  scleractinian corals and their algal symbionts (Symbiodinium
                  sp.) to stressors associated with bleaching. Here, we quantify
                  the effects of long-term (95-day) thermal and
                  CO2-acidification stress on photochemical efficiency of in
                  hospite Symbiodinium within the coral Siderastrea siderea,
                  along with corresponding coral color intensity, for corals
                  from two reef zones (forereef, nearshore) on the Mesoamerican
                  Barrier Reef System. We then explore the molecular responses
                  of in hospite Symbiodinium to these stressors via genome-wide
                  gene expression profiling. Elevated temperatures reduced
                  symbiont photochemical efficiencies and were highly correlated
                  with coral color loss. However, photochemical efficiencies of
                  forereef symbionts were more negatively affected by thermal
                  stress than nearshore symbionts, suggesting greater thermal
                  tolerance and/or reduced photodamage in nearshore corals. At
                  control temperatures, CO2-acidification had little effect on
                  symbiont physiology, although forereef symbionts exhibited
                  constitutively higher photochemical efficiencies than
                  nearshore symbionts. Gene expression profiling revealed that
                  S. siderea were dominated by Symbiodinium goreaui (C1), except
                  under thermal stress, which caused shifts to thermotolerant
                  Symbiodinium trenchii (D1a). Comparative transcriptomics of
                  conserved genes across the host and symbiont revealed few
                  differentially expressed S. goreaui genes when compared to S.
                  siderea, highlighting the host's role in the coral's response
                  to environmental stress. Although S. goreaui transcriptomes
                  did not vary in response to acidification stress, their gene
                  expression was strongly dependent on reef zone, with forereef
                  S. goreaui exhibiting enrichment of genes associated with
                  photosynthesis. This finding, coupled with constitutively
                  higher forereef S. goreaui photochemical efficiencies,
                  suggests that functional differences in genes associated with
                  primary production exist between reef zones.},

                  microbiome composition, and further investigated the structure
                  of the tissue and skeleton bacterial communities. Our results
                  show that host phylogeny and traits explained 14\% of the
                  tissue and 13\% of the skeletal microbiome composition,
                  providing evidence that these predictors contributed to
                  shaping the holobiont in terms of presence and relative
                  abundance of bacterial symbionts. Based on our data, we
                  conclude that host phylogeny affects the presence of speciﬁc
                  microbial lineages, reproductive mode predictably inﬂuences
                  the microbiome composition, and skeletal architecture works
                  like a ﬁlter that affects bacterial relative abundance. We
                  show that the b-diversity of coral tissue and skeleton
                  microbiomes differed, but we found that a large overlapping
                  fraction of bacterial sequences were recovered from both
                  anatomical compartments, supporting the hypothesis that the
                  skeleton can function as a microbial reservoir. Additionally,
                  our analysis of the microbiome structure shows that 99.6\% of
                  tissue and 99.7\% of skeletal amplicon sequence variants
                  (ASVs) were not consistently present in at least 30\% of the
                  samples, suggesting that the coral tissue and skeleton are
                  dominated by rare bacteria. Together, these results provide
                  novel insights into the processes driving coral-bacterial
                  symbioses, along with an improved understanding of the
                  scleractinian microbiome.},

                  has been compounded by the low settlement and survival of
                  coral juveniles. To rebuild coral communities, restoration
                  practitioners have developed workflows to settle vulnerable
                  coral larvae in the laboratory and outplant settled juveniles
                  back to natural and artificial reefs. These workflows often
                  make use of natural biochemical settlement cues, which are
                  presented to swimming larvae to induce settlement. This paper
                  establishes the potential for inorganic cues to complement
                  these known biochemical effects. Settlement substrates were
                  fabricated from calcium carbonate, a material present
                  naturally on reefs, and modified with additives including
                  sands, glasses, and alkaline earth carbonates. Experiments
                  with larvae of two Caribbean coral species revealed
                  additive-specific settlement preferences that were independent
                  of bulk surface properties such as mean roughness and
                  wettability. Instead, analyses of the substrates suggest that
                  settling coral larvae can detect localized topographical
                  features more than an order of magnitude smaller than their

                  ability of reef-building corals to acclimatize to thermal

                  may become an important tool in improving the resilience of
                  coral reefs to rapid environmental change. We investigated
                  whether historical bleaching phenotype, coral host genotype,
                  and exposure to protective temperature treatments would affect
                  the response of the Hawaiian coral Montipora capitata to
                  natural thermal stress. Fragments were collected from colonies
                  that demonstrated different bleaching responses during the
                  2014–2015 event in Kāne‘ohe Bay (O‘ahu, Hawai‘i) and exposed
                  to four different artificial temperature pre-treatments (and a
                  control at ambient temperature). After recovery, fragments
                  experienced a natural thermal stress event either in
                  laboratory conditions or their native reef environment.
                  Response to thermal stress was quantified by measuring changes
                  in the algal symbionts’ photochemical efficiency, community
                  composition, and relative density. Historical bleaching
                  phenotype was reflected in stable differences in symbiont
                  community composition, with historically bleached corals
                  containing only Cladocopium symbionts and historically
                  non-bleached corals having mixed symbiont communities
                  dominated by Durusdinium. Mixed-community corals lost more
                  Cladocopium than Cladocopium-only corals during the natural
                  thermal stress event and preferentially recovered with
                  Durusdinium. Laboratory pre-treatments exposed corals to more
                  thermal stress than anticipated, causing photochemical damage
                  that varied significantly by genotype. While none of the
                  treatments had a protective effect, temperature variation
                  during treatments had a significant detrimental effect on
                  photochemical efficiency during the thermal stress event.
                  These results show that acclimatization potential is affected

                  genotype, and relatively stable differences in symbiont

                  processes in corals. Therefore, changes in lipid composition
                  reflect changes in the ecology, nutrition, and health of
                  corals. As such, accurate lipid extraction, quantification,
                  and identification is critical to obtain comprehensive insight
                  into a coral’s condition. However, discrepancies exist in
                  sample preparation methodology globally, and it is currently
                  unknown whether these techniques generate analogous results.
                  This study compared the two most common sample preparation
                  techniques for lipid analysis in corals: (1) tissue isolation
                  by air-spraying and (2) crushing the coral in toto. Samples
                  derived from each preparation technique were subsequently
                  analysed to quantify lipids and their constituent classes and
                  fatty acids in four common, scleractinian coral species
                  representing three distinct morphotypes (Acropora millepora,
                  Montipora crassotuberculata, Porites cylindrica, and
                  Pocillopora damicornis). Results revealed substantial amounts
                  of organic material, including lipids, retained in the
                  skeletons of all species following air-spraying, causing a
                  marked underestimation of total lipid concentration using this
                  method. Moreover, lipid class and fatty acid compositions
                  between the denuded skeleton and sprayed tissue were
                  substantially different. In particular, the majority of the
                  total triacylglycerol and total fatty acid concentrations were
                  retained in the skeleton (55–69\% and 56–64\%, respectively).
                  As such, the isolated, sprayed tissue cannot serve as a
                  reliable proxy for lipid quantification or identification in
                  the coral holobiont. The in toto crushing method is therefore
                  recommended for coral sample preparation prior to lipid
                  analysis to capture the lipid profile of the entire holobiont,
                  permitting accurate diagnoses of coral condition.},

                  development of robust commercial aquaculture for this
                  crustacean. As a foundation study in this area, the chemical
                  composition of early–mid stage P. ornatus phyllosoma (Stages
                  I–VI) receiving a novel formulated diet was analysed
                  immediately prior and post-ecdysis to provide insight into the
                  crude nutritional trends during the larval development cycle.
                  From the onset of moulting, cyclical patterns were evident in
                  the proximate composition of phyllosoma, resulting in
                  substantial restructuring between the pre- and post-moult
                  stages of the moult cycle. Proportions of protein, lipid and
                  ash were high at the premoult stage, reﬂecting growth and
                  nutrient accumulation over the intermoult period, and reduced
                  at the post-moult stage, reﬂecting the large uptake of water
                  to facilitate subsequent growth. Polar lipid was the dominant
                  lipid class, accounting for N90\% of the total lipid content.
                  Conversely, triacylglycerol concentrations were low (b5\%),
                  despite being the principal lipid class available in the
                  formulated diet. Likewise, despite receiving high
                  concentrations of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5n-3) and
                  docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n-3) (9.2 and 7.6\% of the
                  dietary lipid source, respectively), levels of these fatty
                  acids were comparatively low in phyllosoma (3.4 and 4.7\%,
                  respectively). In contrast, there is selective deposition of
                  these fatty acids in wild caught phyllosoma. This ﬁnding
                  suggests a poor assimilation of triacylglycerols by captive
                  larvae and highlights the importance of future investigations
                  into alternative sources of EPA and DHA. Ultimately, this
                  study provides insight into the nutritional requirements of
                  phyllosoma, providing valuable knowledge on diet formulation

                  overfishing, habitat destruction, and pollution. Historical
                  baselines of coral cover are important to understand how much
                  coral cover has been lost, e.g., to avoid the ‘shifting

                  coral reef cover prior to the industrial revolution, and
                  therefore baselines of coral reef cover are difficult to
                  estimate. Here, we use expert and ocean-user opinion surveys
                  to estimate baselines of global coral reef cover. The overall

                  ability of corals to settle after disturbances. While crustose
                  coralline algae (CCA) are considered important substrates for
                  coral settlement, it remains unclear whether coral larvae
                  respond to CCA metabolites and microbial cues when selecting
                  sites for attachment and metamorphosis. This study tested the
                  settlement preferences of an abundant coral species ( Acropora
                  cytherea ) against six different CCA species from three
                  habitats (exposed, subcryptic and cryptic), and compared these
                  preferences with the metabolome and microbiome characterizing
                  the CCA. While all CCA species induced settlement, only one
                  species ( Titanoderma prototypum ) significantly promoted
                  settlement on the CCA surface, rather than on nearby dead
                  coral or plastic surfaces. This species had a very distinct
                  bacterial community and metabolomic fingerprint. Furthermore,
                  coral settlement rates and the CCA microbiome and metabolome
                  were specific to the CCA preferred habitat, suggesting that
                  microbes and/or chemicals serve as environmental indicators
                  for coral larvae. Several amplicon sequence variants and two
                  lipid classes—glycoglycerolipids and betaine lipids—present in
                  T. prototypum were identified as potential omic cues
                  influencing coral settlement. These results support that the
                  distinct microbiome and metabolome of T. prototypum may
                  promote the settlement and attachment of coral larvae.},

  abstract     = {Background: Life in the ocean will increasingly have to
                  contend with a complex matrix of concurrent shifts in
                  environmental properties that impact their physiology and
                  control their life histories. Rhodoliths are coralline red
                  algae (Corallinales, Rhodophyta) that are photosynthesizers,
                  calcifiers, and ecosystem engineers and therefore represent
                  important targets for ocean acidification (OA) research. Here,
                  we exposed live rhodoliths to near-future OA conditions to
                  investigate responses in their photosynthetic capacity,
                  calcium carbonate production, and associated microbiome using
                  carbon uptake, decalcification assays, and whole genome
                  shotgun sequencing metagenomic analysis, respectively. The
                  results from our live rhodolith assays were compared to
                  similar manipulations on dead rhodolith (calcareous skeleton)
                  biofilms and water column microbial communities, thereby
                  enabling the assessment of host-microbiome interaction under
                  climate-driven environmental perturbations. Results: Under
                  high pCO(2) conditions, live rhodoliths exhibited positive
                  physiological responses, i.e. increased photosynthetic
                  activity, and no calcium carbonate biomass loss over time.
                  Further, whereas the microbiome associated with live
                  rhodoliths remained stable and resembled a healthy holobiont,
                  the microbial community associated with the water column
                  changed after exposure to elevated pCO(2). Conclusions: Our
                  results suggest that a tightly regulated microbial-host
                  interaction, as evidenced by the stability of the rhodolith
                  microbiome recorded here under OA-like conditions, is
                  important for host resilience to environmental stress. This
                  study extends the scarce comprehension of microbes associated
                  with rhodolith beds and their reaction to increased pCO(2),
                  providing a more comprehensive approach to OA studies by
                  assessing the host holobiont.},

  abstract     = {Crustose coralline algae (CCA), a group of calcifying red
                  algae found commonly in benthic marine ecosystems worldwide,
                  perform essential ecological functions on coral reefs,
                  including creating benthic substrate, stabilizing the reef
                  structure and inducing coral settlement. An important feature
                  of CCA is the ability to keep their surfaces free of epiphytic
                  algae, thereby reducing algal overgrowth and allowing them
                  access to light. However, the mechanisms by which CCA prevent
                  settlement of opportunistic seaweeds (fleshy macroalgae) are
                  not fully understood, nor is whether these mechanisms vary
                  among CCA species. In our study based on the Great Barrier
                  Reef, we demonstrate that three common CCA species
                  (Titanoderma pustulatum, Porolithon onkodes and Neogoniolithon
                  sp.) have a remarkable ability to deter settlement of seaweed
                  spores. We provide experimental evidence that the CCA use
                  allelopathy and microbial inhibition against the settlement of
                  spores of the brown seaweed Padina boergesenii. Methanol
                  extracts of allelopathic compounds from T. pustulatum, Po.
                  onkodes and Neogoniolithon sp. significantly reduced the
                  settlement of Pa. boergesenii spores by 4.3 times, 3.0 and 3.8
                  times, respectively. Further, we found that microbial
                  biofilms, while having a lower inhibitory effect than
                  allelopathic compounds, also reduced seaweed settlement of Pa.
                  boergesenii. Our study demonstrates that allelopathy and
                  microbial inhibition, in addition to epithallial tissue
                  sloughing, are mechanisms employed by CCA to prevent the
                  settlement of epiphytic algae. Understanding the mechanisms by
                  which CCA avoid seaweed overgrowth contributes to our
                  understanding of the dynamics of seaweed proliferations on
                  reefs and to the ecological knowledge of this important group
                  of reef-building organisms.},

                  have occurred. These assessments, however, often ignore the
                  remainder of the benthos and thus provide limited information
                  on the present-day structure and function of coral reef
                  communities. Here, using an unprecedentedly large dataset
                  collected within the last 10 years across 56 islands spanning
                  five archipelagos in the central Pacific, we examine how
                  benthic reef communities differ in the presence and absence of
                  human populations. Using islands as replicates, we examine
                  whether benthic community structure is associated with human
                  habitation within and among archipelagos and across latitude.
                  While there was no evidence for coral to macroalgal phase
                  shifts across our dataset we did find that the majority of
                  reefs on inhabited islands were dominated by fleshy
                  non-reef-building organisms (turf algae, fleshy macroalgae and
                  non-calcifying invertebrates). By contrast, benthic
                  communities from uninhabited islands were more variable but in
                  general supported more calcifiers and active reef builders
                  (stony corals and crustose coralline algae). Our results
                  suggest that cumulative human impacts across the central
                  Pacific may be causing a reduction in the abundance of reef
                  builders resulting in island scale phase shifts to dominance

                  with potentially major impacts on coastal ecosystems. These
                  “marine heatwaves” (MHWs) have been linked to changes in
                  primary productivity, community composition and biogeography
                  of seaweeds, which often control ecosystem function and
                  services. Here we review the literature on seaweed responses
                  to MHWs, including 58 observations related to resistance,
                  bleaching, changes in abundance, species invasions and local
                  to regional extinctions. More records existed for
                  canopy-forming kelps and bladed and filamentous turf-forming
                  seaweeds than for canopy-forming fucoids, geniculate coralline
                  turf and crustose coralline algae. Turf-forming seaweeds,
                  especially invasive seaweeds, generally increased in abundance
                  after a MHW, whereas native canopy-forming kelps and fucoids
                  typically declined in abundance. We also found four examples
                  of regional extinctions of kelp and fucoids following specific
                  MHWs, events that likely have long term consequences for
                  ecological structure and functioning. Although a relatively
                  small number of studies have described impacts of MHWs on
                  seaweed, the broad range of documented responses highlights
                  the necessity of better baseline information regarding seaweed
                  distributions and performance, and the need to study specific
                  characteristics of MHWs that affect the vulnerability and
                  resilience of seaweeds to these increasingly important
                  climatic perturbations. A major challenge will be to
                  disentangle impacts caused by the extreme temperature
                  increases of MHWs itself from co-occurring potential stressors
                  including altered current patterns, increasing herbivory,
                  changes in water clarity and nutrient content, solar radiation
                  and desiccation stress in the intertidal zone. With future
                  increases anticipated in the intensity, duration and
                  frequencies of MHWs, we expect to see more replacements of
                  large long-lived habitat forming seaweeds with smaller
                  ephemeral seaweeds, reducing the habitat structure and
                  effective services seaweed-dominated reefs can provide.},

                ranging from clinical to environmental studies. Since the advent

                exponential progress in the studies of not only genomics (and

                major fields such as genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and
                metabolomics, in addition to minor omics-based approaches such

                  to precipitate CaCO3 within the walls of their vegetative
                  cells. The resultant carbonate structure is key for explaining
                  their ecological success, as it provides protection against
                  herbivores and resistance to water motion. However, its
                  potential contribution to enhance thallus light absorption
                  efficiency through multiple light scattering on algal
                  skeleton, similar to the effect documented for scleractinian
                  corals, has not been yet investigated. Here, we initiate this
                  analysis, characterizing thallus optical properties of three
                  coralline species, which differed in pigment content and
                  thallus mass area (TMA, gDW m−2). The three species, the
                  rhodolith Neogoniolithon sp., the crustose coralline alga
                  (CCA), Lithothamnion sp., and the articulated alga Amphiroa
                  tribulus, represent the more distinctive coralline
                  growth-forms and are able to colonize contrasting light
                  environments in Caribbean coral reefs. The thicker thalli of
                  the rhodoliths were the most efficient light collectors, as
                  evidenced by their higher pigment absorption efficiency
                  (a*Chla; m2 mgChla−1) and photosynthetic rates per unit area.
                  This could explain rhodolith success in oligotrophic, highly
                  illuminated reef environments. In contrast, the thinner thalli
                  of the CCA, a low-light specialist, showed the highest
                  metabolic rates normalized to mass and the highest light
                  absorption efficiencies per unit mass (a*M; m2 gdw−1).

                  habitats within the reef cannot be explained only by its
                  low-light physiology, but also by its capacity to reduce the
                  structural costs of their thalli, and thus of its new growth.
                  Lastly, the ecological success of Amphiroa tribulus, which
                  displayed intermediate values for the efficiency of light
                  absorption, metabolic rates and TMA, was explained by its
                  ability to construct the largest light collectors (algal
                  canopies) thanks to the presence of flexible, non-calcified
                  segments (genicula). This ability enables enhanced
                  photosynthetic and carbonate production at the organism/canopy
                  level. The resulting fragile canopy survives best within the
                  protection provided by colonies of the lettuce coral Agaricia
                  agaricites. In conclusion, our study demonstrates the utility
                  of optical traits as powerful tools to investigate differences
                  in the competitive abilities, abundances and niche
                  distribution among algal species and/or growth-forms.},

                  to characterise the interactions of organisms with their
                  environment. This approach has many advantages for studying
                  organism–environment interactions and for assessing organism
                  function and health at the molecular level. As such,
                  metabolomics is finding an increasing number of applications
                  in the environmental sciences, ranging from understanding
                  organismal responses to abiotic pressures, to investigating
                  the responses of organisms to other biota. These interactions
                  can be studied from individuals to populations, which can be
                  related to the traditional fields of ecophysiology and
                  ecology, and from instantaneous effects to those over
                  evolutionary time scales, the latter enabling studies of
                  genetic adaptation. This review provides a comprehensive and
                  current overview of environmental metabolomics research. We
                  begin with an overview of metabolomic studies into the effects
                  of abiotic pressures on organisms. In the field of
                  ecophysiology, studies on the metabolic responses to
                  temperature, water, food availability, light and circadian
                  rhythms, atmospheric gases and season are reviewed. A section
                  on ecotoxicogenomics discusses research in aquatic and
                  terrestrial ecotoxicology, assessing organismal responses to
                  anthropogenic pollutants in both the laboratory and field. We
                  then discuss environmental metabolomic studies of diseases and
                  biotic–biotic interactions, in particular herbivory. Finally,
                  we critically evaluate the contribution that metabolomics has
                  made to the environmental sciences, and highlight and discuss
                  recommendations to advance our understanding of the
                  environment, ecology and evolution using a metabolomics

                  and Amphiroa fragilissima) were evaluated. The results
                  revealed that Por. onkodes and H. cylindracea significantly
                  enhanced the rates of settlement and metamorphosis, whereas
                  fewer larvae settled on Am. fragilissima and H. opuntia.
                  Amplicon pyrosequencing of the V3-V4 region of 16S rDNA was
                  applied to investigate the relationship between algal

                  organisms play a particularly critical role in the transfer of
                  symbionts across generations; however, their influence and
                  relative importance in the marine environment has rarely been
                  considered. Coral reefs are biologically diverse and
                  productive marine ecosystems, whose success is framed by
                  symbiosis between reefbuilding corals and unicellular
                  dinoflagellates in the genus Symbiodinium. Many corals produce
                  aposymbiotic larvae that are infected by Symbiodinium from the
                  environment (horizontal transmission), which allows for the
                  acquisition of new endosymbionts (different from their
                  parents) each generation. In the remaining species,
                  Symbiodinium are transmitted directly from parent to offspring
                  via eggs (vertical transmission), a mechanism that perpetuates
                  the relationship between some or all of the Symbiodinium
                  diversity found in the parent through multiple generations.
                  Here we examine vertical transmission in the Hawaiian coral
                  Montipora capitata by comparing the Symbiodinium ITS2 sequence
                  assemblages in parent colonies and the eggs they produce.
                  Parental effects on sequence assemblages in eggs are explored
                  in the context of the coral genotype, colony morphology, and
                  the environment of parent colonies. Our results indicate that
                  ITS2 sequence assemblages in eggs are generally similar to
                  their parents, and patterns in parental assemblages are
                  different, and reflect environmental conditions, but not
                  colony morphology or coral genotype. We conclude that eggs
                  released by parent colonies during mass spawning events are
                  seeded with different ITS2 sequence assemblages, which
                  encompass phylogenetic variability that may have profound
                  implications for the development, settlement and survival of
                  coral offspring.},

  abstract = {The third global coral bleaching event, which started in 2014 and
              extended well into 2017, was the longest coral bleaching event on
              record. The length of the event means corals in some parts of the
              world had no time to recover in 2014, 2015 or 2016 during the
              cool/winter season, prior to experiencing bleaching the following
              year. This recent global bleaching event of 2014-2017 represents
              what climate model projections presented in this Report suggest
              may become the norm over the coming two decades. Importantly
              though, great spatial variation exists in the projected timing of
              the onset of annual severe bleaching (ASB) conditions among the
              world’s coral reefs. ASB is calculated as the projected date
              beyond which a reef is expected to experience severe bleaching
              conditions annually (at least 8 Degree Heating Weeks). Variation
              in ASB timing will be a major driver of differences in the
              relative vulnerability of coral reef ecosystems to climate change.
              Reef areas projected to experience ASB much later than other reef
              areas could be temporary refugia that have lower climate
              vulnerability. These refugia may provide ecosystem goods and
              services for longer so should be considered as potential
              conservation and restoration priorities. This project team
              previously developed projections of the exposure component of
              climate vulnerability in coral reef areas. These projections were
              based on the World Climate Research Programme’s Working Group on
              Coupled Modelling (WGCM) Coupled Model Intercomparison Project
              Phase 5 (CMIP5) generation of climate models (used by the IPCC in
              the 5th Assessment Report – AR5). These projections, which were
              statistically downscaled to 4-km are reviewed in UNEP (2017) and
              van Hooidonk et al. (2016). This report updates the UNEP 2017
              report with projections of the timing of severe coral bleaching
              conditions using the new generation of climate models used by the
              IPCC – the CMIP6 generation of models. The motivation in providing
              this update is that some CMIP6 models have >4x the spatial
              resolution (some have native resolutions of ¼ x ¼°; ~ 27 x 27km at
              the equator) than CMIP5 models (native resolution of 1 x 1°; ~110
              x 110km) and include other improvements. Further, the CMIP6 models
              are forced by the recently released Shared Socioeconomic Pathways
              (SSPs – see Riahi (2017) for an overview). The CMIP6 models
              represent the current state-of-the-art in climate modeling to
              deliver climate science that informs regional and global climate
              policy. These projections presented here are of future exposure to
              bleaching conditions (i.e., temperature stress); the socio-ecology
              of coral reefs within all grid cells will vary and this variance
              is not built into these projections. Projections of the timing of
              annual severe bleaching conditions are compared in this report for
              SSP5-8.5 and SSP2-4.5 to examine the implications of climate
              policy for coral reefs. SSP5-8.5 is the pathway that represents
              current rates of emissions and emissions growth; it is also
              considered a “worst-case scenario”. This scenario assumes there is
              no climate policy or that policy is not effective. SSP5-8.5
              represents a growing world economy heavily dependent on fossil
              fuels. Results from the SSP5-8.5 pathway are most of the focus of
              this report and can be seen as using the precautionary principle
              in planning. SSP2-4.5 is a highly ambitious but plausible
              scenario. SSP2-4.5 is a “middle of the road” pathway in which
              emissions continue to increase through the end of the century,
              reaching between 65GtCO2 and 85GtCO2, with resulting warming of
              3.8-4.2°C. This scenario was selected because it could represent
              future conditions if greater levels of emissions reduction (~150\%
              of pledges) are achieved than would result from all Nationally
              Determined Contributions in the Paris Agreement combined. The
              purpose of this report is threefold: 1. To present projections of
              coral bleaching conditions (i.e., exposure to the primary climate
              threat to coral reefs) and potential adaptation at a spatial scale
              that enables use of the data in management and conservation
              planning and in support of other decisions influencing coral reefs
              and reef use; 2. To evaluate the implications of the Paris
              Agreement as well as failure to achieve its goal, by comparing the
              projected timing of annual severe bleaching between Shared
              Socioeconomic Pathways SSP5-8.5 and SSP2-4.5; and 3. To provide
              public access to the projections data as well as the main findings
              to catalyze research that extends the purposes and applications
              described in 1 and 2, and informs new research. The report has
              been prepared with the coral reef scientific and management
              community as the primary target audience. Results highlights
              include: • Under the fossil-fuel aggressive SSP5-8.5, ASB is
              projected to occur within this century for 100\% of the world’s
              coral reefs. The average projected year of ASB is 2034, nine years
              earlier than was projected as a global average for RCP8.5 using
              CMIP5 models. This suggests the previous CMIP5 generation of
              projections of future bleaching conditions underestimated the near
              future threat of annual severe bleaching. • Projected exposure to
              annual severe bleaching conditions varies greatly among and within
              countries under SSP5-8.5. Coral reefs with relatively early and
              late exposure to annual bleaching conditions occur in all of the
              ocean basins; however, some countries have more temporary refugia
              than others. Six of the 20 countries with the greatest reef area
              have >25\% temporary refugia (i.e., projected ASB after 2044),
              including: Indonesia (35\%), western Australia (70\%), The Bahamas
              (26\%), Madagascar (30\%), India (37\%), and Malaysia (47\%).
              Thirteen of the 20 countries with the greatest reef area have
              >25\% of reef areas that are projected to experience annual
              bleaching conditions relatively early. Some of these countries
              include the Philippines, Solomon Islands, Fuji, Cuba, and Saudi
              Arabia. It is important to note that these projections should not
              be interpreted as predictions of exactly when bleaching will occur
              and do not imply that any reef areas, including relative refugia,
              are safe from severe bleaching. • The average year for the
              projected timing of ASB under SSP2-4.5 is 2045, 11 years later
              than the average year projected under SSP5-8.5. Successful
              mitigation in line with the Paris Agreement would do little to
              provide reefs with more time to adapt or acclimate prior to severe
              coral bleaching conditions occurring annually. There are three
              major results from the projections that assume coral adaptation
              levels between 0.25° and 2°C: 1) Each quarter degree of assumed
              adaptation adds ~7 years to the global average timing of projected
              annual severe bleaching; 2) The great majority of coral reefs
              (>80\%) are expected to experience ASB this century even if 2°C of
              adaptation is assumed; 3) There is great spatial variation in the
              benefits to reefs, in terms of later ASB timing, at each assumed
              adaption level. The extent to which corals will adapt to
              increasing sea temperatures is unknown, but some level of
              adaptation is expected. If we assume 1°C of adaptation, the global
              average ASB timing is ~30 years later than if no adaptation is
              assumed. The projections describe and quantify climate change
              exposure of coral reefs and thus contribute to our understanding
              of coral reef vulnerability. These projections can guide
              management, conservation and restoration planning, and be used in
              education and outreach programs. Recommendations for next steps
              and research priorities include: downscaling the projections to
              5-km scale to distinguish what are known to be local-scale
              differences in average summer temperatures and the bleaching
              threshold; better understanding the drivers and spatial patterns
              of coral and coral community adaptation to thermal stress; and,
              combining the projections with analyses of bleaching observations
              to identify reef areas that have fared better (‘bright spots’) or
              worse (‘dark spots’) than expected during recent bleaching events.
              Advances in any of those areas will increase confidence in the
              projections as well as the capacity of managers to use the
              projections in conservation planning, policy, and stakeholder
              engagement and outreach.},

                  research on CCA has shown that only a few species play a
                  significant role in the settlement of coral larvae through
                  either the production of chemical settlement cues or the
                  facilitation of specific microbial communities that are
                  hypothesized to influence coral settlement. Thus, defining how

                  bacterioplankton communities these exudates facilitate is
                  important for understanding the role of CCA in invertebrate
                  settlement. We conducted single day exudation experiments on
                  two species of CCA to compare tissue microbiome community
                  structure, DOM production and the effect of DOM on the

                  Calcifying reef taxa such as corals and coralline algae
                  provide the essential substrate and habitat in tropical reefs
                  but are at particular risk due to their susceptibility to both
                  OW and OA. OW poses the greater threat to future reef growth
                  and function, via its capacity to destabilise the productivity
                  of both taxa, and to cause mass bleaching events and mortality
                  of corals. Marine heatwaves are projected to increase in
                  frequency, intensity, and duration over the coming decades,
                  raising the question of whether coral reefs will be able to
                  persist as functioning ecosystems and in what form. OA should
                  not be overlooked, as its negative impacts on the
                  calcification of reef-building corals and coralline algae will
                  have consequences for global reef accretion. Given that OA can
                  have negative impacts on the reproduction and early life
                  stages of both coralline algae and corals, the interdependence
                  of these taxa may result in negative feedbacks for reef
                  replenishment. However, there is little evidence that OA
                  causes coral bleaching or exacerbates the effects of OW on
                  coral bleaching. Instead, there is some evidence that OA
                  alters the photo-physiology of both taxa. Tropical coralline
                  algal possess shorter generation times than corals, which
                  could enable more rapid evolutionary responses. Future reefs
                  will be dominated by taxa with shorter generation times and
                  high plasticity, or those individuals inherently resistant and
                  resilient to both marine heatwaves and OA.},

                  Their presence has attracted considerable attention due to
                  their potential impacts on ecosystem functioning and on public
                  health, so their quantification has become a necessity.
                  Various extraction procedures as well as gas/liquid
                  chromatography and mass spectrometry detection techniques are
                  found as suitable for reliable detection of such compounds.
                  However, PAEs are ubiquitous in the laboratory environment
                  including ambient air, reagents, sampling equipment, and
                  various analytical devices, that induces difficult analysis of
                  real samples with a low PAE background. Therefore, accurate
                  PAE analysis in environmental matrices is a challenging task.
                  This paper reviews the extensive literature data on the

                  for the vivid colouration of many reef-building corals and
                  have been proposed to act as photoprotectants. Their role
                  remains controversial because the functional mechanism has not
                  been elucidated. We provide direct evidence to support a
                  photoprotective role of the non-fluorescent chromoproteins
                  (CPs) that form a biochemically and photophysically distinct
                  group of GFP-like proteins. Based on observations of Acropora
                  nobilis from the Great Barrier Reef, we explored the
                  photoprotective role of CPs by analysing five coral species
                  under controlled conditions. In vitro and in hospite analyses
                  of chlorophyll excitation demonstrate that screening by CPs
                  leads to a reduction in chlorophyll excitation corresponding
                  to the spectral properties of the specific CPs present in the
                  coral tissues. Between 562 and 586 nm, the CPs maximal
                  absorption range, there was an up to 50 \% reduction of
                  chlorophyll excitation. The screening was consistent for
                  established and regenerating tissue and amongst symbiont
                  clades A, C and D. Moreover, among two differently pigmented
                  morphs of Acropora valida grown under identical light
                  conditions and hosting subclade type C3 symbionts, high CP

                  combines a simple, inexpensive, and solvent-less sample
                  preparation technique with the specificity and speed of
                  DESI-MS and MS/MS. Extraction of seven drugs from raw urine is
                  performed using specially designed SPME fibers coated
                  uniformly with silica-C(18) stationary phase. Each SPME device
                  is inserted into unprocessed urine under gentle agitation and,
                  then, removed, rinsed, and analyzed directly by DESI-MS
                  (MS/MS). Rapid screening over a wide mass range is afforded by
                  coupling the method with a time of flight (TOF) mass

                  selected reaction monitoring (SRM) using a triple quadrupole
                  mass spectrometer. The performance of the SPME DESI-MS/MS
                  method was evaluated by preparing calibration standards and
                  quality control (QC) samples of the seven drug compounds from
                  urine over a range from 20 to 1000 ng/mL, with the exception
                  of meprobamate which was prepared from 200 to 10000 ng/mL. The
                  calibration curves constructed for each analyte had an R(2) >
                  0.99. The range of precision (\%CV) and accuracy values (\%
                  bias) for low QC samples was 1-11\% and 3-38\%, respectively.
                  Precision and accuracy values for high QC samples range from
                  0.9 to 8\% and -31 to -8\%. Results from urine specimens of
                  actual exposure to drugs screened using the SPME DESI-MS/MS
                  method showed good agreement with the conventional

  abstract     = {The symbiotic association between the coral animal and its
                  endosymbiotic dinoflagellate partner Symbiodinium is central
                  to the success of corals. However, an array of other
                  microorganisms associated with coral (i.e., Bacteria, Archaea,
                  Fungi, and viruses) have a complex and intricate role in
                  maintaining homeostasis between corals and Symbiodinium.
                  Corals are sensitive to shifts in the surrounding
                  environmental conditions. One of the most widely reported
                  responses of coral to stressful environmental conditions is
                  bleaching. During this event, corals expel Symbiodinium cells
                  from their gastrodermal tissues upon experiencing extended
                  seawater temperatures above their thermal threshold. An array
                  of other environmental stressors can also destabilize the
                  coral microbiome, resulting in compromised health of the host,
                  which may include disease and mortality in the worst scenario.
                  However, the exact mechanisms by which the coral microbiome
                  supports coral health and increases resilience are poorly
                  understood. Earlier studies of coral microbiology proposed a
                  coral probiotic hypothesis, wherein a dynamic relationship
                  exists between corals and their symbiotic microorganisms,
                  selecting for the coral holobiont that is best suited for the
                  prevailing environmental conditions. Here, we discuss the
                  microbial-host relationships within the coral holobiont, along
                  with their potential roles in maintaining coral health. We
                  propose the term BMC (Beneficial Microorganisms for Corals) to
                  define (specific) symbionts that promote coral health. This
                  term and concept are analogous to the term Plant Growth
                  Promoting Rhizosphere (PGPR), which has been widely explored
                  and manipulated in the agricultural industry for
                  microorganisms that inhabit the rhizosphere and directly or
                  indirectly promote plant growth and development through the
                  production of regulatory signals, antibiotics and nutrients.
                  Additionally, we propose and discuss the potential mechanisms
                  of the effects of BMC on corals, suggesting strategies for the
                  use of this knowledge to manipulate the microbiome, reversing
                  dysbiosis to restore and protect coral reefs. This may include
                  developing and using BMC consortia as environmental
                  “probiotics” to improve coral resistance after bleaching
                  events and/or the use of BMC with other strategies such as
                  human-assisted acclimation/adaption to shifting environmental
                  conditions.},

                  (ANOSIM: p < 0.001 for prokaryotes and microbial eukaryotes).
                  In bleached state corals, we found differences in microbial
                  compositions from the healthy state corals. Prevalent
                  differences shared among bleached coral genera (shared in at
                  least three coral genera) included a loss of reported
                  coral-beneficial microbes, such as Pseudomonadales,

                  multiple polyps and integrating them into a coral colony are
                  still enigmatic. Using live imaging, particle tracking, and

                  These currents involve surface mucus of different
                  concentrations, which regulate joint feeding of the colony.
                  Inside the coral, within the gastrovascular system, we expose
                  the complexity of bidirectional branching streams that connect

                  public and scientific community. Scler­ actinian corals are
                  the foundation species of coral reef ecosystems that are
                  greatly affected by the microplastics (MPs), yet little is
                  known about the effects of microplastics on the coral
                  azooxanthellate. In the present study, effects of the exposure
                  and ingestion of polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyethylene (PE),
                  polyethylene terephthalate (PET), and polyamide 66 (PA66) were
                  studied on the physiological responses of Tubastrea aurea. Our
                  results shows that coral ingested microplastics in four
                  treatment groups and the exposure of microplastics inhibited
                  the antioxidant capacity, immune system, calcification and
                  energy metabolism of the coral Tubastrea aurea. Super­ oxide

                  35.5\%, 73.9\%, and 52.2\% in the corals exposed to PVC,

                  true coral reefs throughout the last 150 Ma. We investigated
                  if repeated breakdowns in the potential capacity of CCA to
                  spur reef development were associated with sea level, ocean

                  important as a surrogate for phospholipids during phosphate
                  deficiency, but is also required for adaptation to low
                  temperature conditions.,
                  Diacylglyceryl-N,N,N-trimethylhomo-Ser (DGTS) is a
                  nonphosphorous, polar glycerolipid that is regarded as
                  analogous to the phosphatidylcholine in bacteria, fungi,
                  algae, and basal land plants. In some species of algae,
                  including the stramenopile microalga Nannochloropsis oceanica,
                  DGTS contains an abundance of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA),
                  which is relatively scarce in phosphatidylcholine, implying
                  that DGTS has a unique physiological role. In this study, we
                  addressed the role of DGTS in N. oceanica. We identified two
                  DGTS biosynthetic enzymes that have distinct domain
                  configurations compared to previously identified DGTS
                  synthases. Mutants lacking DGTS showed growth retardation
                  under phosphate starvation, demonstrating a pivotal role for
                  DGTS in the adaptation to this condition. Under normal
                  conditions, DGTS deficiency led to an increase in the relative
                  amount of monogalactosyldiacylglycerol, a major plastid
                  membrane lipid with high EPA content, whereas excessive
                  production of DGTS induced by gene overexpression led to a
                  decrease in monogalactosyldiacylglycerol. Meanwhile, lipid
                  analysis of partial phospholipid-deficient mutants revealed a
                  role for phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine in
                  EPA biosynthesis. These results suggest that DGTS and
                  monogalactosyldiacylglycerol may constitute the two major
                  pools of EPA in extraplastidic and plastidic membranes,
                  partially competing to acquire EPA or its precursors derived
                  from phospholipids. The mutant lacking DGTS also displayed
                  impaired growth and a lower proportion of EPA in
                  extraplastidic compartments at low temperatures. Our results
                  indicate that DGTS is involved in the adaptation to low
                  temperatures through a mechanism that is distinct from the
                  DGTS-dependent adaptation to phosphate starvation in N.

                  increasing temperature and time of exposure (up to 72 h),

                  Toxic chemicals leach with detrimental and often unpredictable
                  impacts on the surrounding ecosystems. We found that seawater
                  leachates of plastic pre-production pellets from 7 recycle
                  categories are acutely toxic to stage II barnacle nauplii;
                  lethal concentration 50 (LC50s) were observed in 24-h
                  leachates from dilutions ranging from 0.007 to 2.1 mg/mL of
                  seawater. Based on previous observations that macro-organismal
                  settlement on fouling management coatings of various
                  toxicities can be used to predict the toxicity of the coating,
                  we hypothesized that interaction of plastic pre-production
                  pellets with emerging microbiomes would exhibit patterns
                  indicative of the chemistry at the pellet surface. We used
                  amplicon sequencing of bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA genes to
                  characterize the microbiomes that developed from 8 through 70
                  days on pellets exposed to the same flowing ambient seawater.
                  Diversity and composition of the microbiomes colonizing
                  plastic pellets changed over time and varied with plastic
                  type. Microbial taxa belong to taxonomic groups known to
                  consume hydrocarbons, to be prevalent following marine oil
                  spills, or to live on fouling management surfaces. Microbiomes
                  were still distinct between plastic types at Day 70,
                  suggesting that differences in the physicochemical
                  characteristics of the underlying plastics continue to exert
                  variable selection of surface microbial communities. A random
                  forest-based sample classifier correctly predicted 93\% of
                  plastic types using microbiome compositions. Surface
                  microbiomes have promise for use in forensically identifying
                  plastic types and potential toxicities.},

                  parameters such as salinity, temperature, pH and solar
                  radiation. This study characterized populations of the
                  intertidal calcifying red alga Corallina officinalis across
                  its geographic distribution in the North-east Atlantic.
                  Processes examined included primary production, respiration,
                  light and dark calcification, photosynthesis-irradiance, and
                  calcification-irradi­ ance evolution. Results confirmed
                  significant differences in the physiology of C. officinalis
                  between latitudes with a clear north-to-south gradient.
                  Compared with central and southern populations of this
                  species, northern populations appeared to be the most robust,
                  showing potential for local physiological adaptation in
                  response to increased variability in environ­ mental factors
                  present within their habitat. Conversely, southern populations
                  displayed a distinct lack of local adaptation compared with
                  northern populations. This is possibly due to southern
                  populations being located within an environment at the upper
                  limit of their stress tolerance, therefore restricting the
                  species’ ability to adapt. As a result, future permanent
                  decline, or even disappearance, of C. officinalis within
                  southern locations of the North-east Atlantic could occur, a
                  process that is likely to be accelerated by predicted future
                  climatic changes. Furthermore, given the essential role these
                  ecosystem engineers play within their habitat, any loss of C.
                  officinalis is also expected to have a strongly negative

  abstract    = {Abstract Thermal tolerance is variable in corals, yet intrinsic
                 and extrinsic drivers of tolerance are not well understood.
                 Understanding the distribution and abundance of heat tolerant
                 corals across seascapes is imperative for predicting responses
                 to climate change and to support novel management actions.
                 Rapid and high-throughput methods to measure heat-induced coral
                 bleaching sensitivity are increasingly required to understand
                 current and predict future responses to climate change.
                 Experimental evaluations of coral heat and bleaching tolerance
                 typically involve ramp-and-hold experiments run across days to
                 weeks within aquarium facilities with limits to colony
                 replication. Field-based acute heat stress assays have emerged
                 as an alternative experimental approach to rapidly quantify
                 heat tolerance in a large number of samples yet the role of key
                 methodological considerations on the stress response measured
                 remains unresolved. Here, we quantify the effects of coral
                 fragment size, sampling time point, and physiological measures
                 on the acute heat stress response in adult corals. The effect
                 of fragment size differed between species ( Acropora tenuis and
                 Pocillopora damicornis ). Most physiological parameters
                 measured here declined over time (tissue colour, chlorophyll-a
                 and protein content) from the onset of heating, with the
                 exception of maximum photosynthetic efficiency ( F v / F m ),
                 which was stable up to 24h post heating. Based on our
                 experiments, we identified photosynthetic efficiency, tissue
                 colour change, and host-specific assays such as catalase
                 activity as key physiological measures for rapid quantification
                 of thermal tolerance. We recommend that future applications of
                 acute heat stress assays include larger fragments (>9cm 2 )
                 where possible and sample between 10 - 14h after the end of
                 heat stress. A validated high-throughput experimental approach
                 combined with cost-effective genomic and physiological
                 measurements underpins the development of markers and maps of
                 heat tolerance across seascapes and ocean warming scenarios.},

                  sea surface temperatures. The adaptive bleaching hypothesis
                  (ABH) posits that when environmental circumstances change, the
                  loss of one or more kinds of zooxanthellae is rapidly,

                  more suited to the new conditions in the host's habitat.
                  Fundamental assumptions of the ABH include (1) different types
                  of zooxanthellae respond differently to environmental
                  conditions, specifically temperature, and (2) bleached adults

                  Lamarck 1801 harbors a single algal strain, Symbiodinium ITS2
                  type C1f (homologous strain) during adulthood. Previous
                  studies have shown that distinct algal ITS2 types in clade C
                  correlate with F. scutaria—Symbiodinium specificity during the
                  onset of symbiosis in the larval stage. The present study
                  examined the early specificity events in the onset of
                  symbiosis between F. scutaria larvae and Symbiodinium spp., by
                  looking at the temporal and spatial infection dynamics of
                  larvae challenged with different symbiont types. The results
                  show that specificity at the onset of symbiosis was mediated
                  by recognition events during the initial symbiont—host
                  physical contact before phagocytosis, and by subsequent
                  cellular events after the symbionts were incorporated into
                  host cells. Moreover, homologous and heterologous Symbiodinium
                  sp. strains did not exhibit the same pattern of localization
                  within larvae. When larvae were infected with homologous
                  symbionts (C1f), ~70\% of the total acquired algae were found
                  in the equatorial area of the larvae, between the oral and
                  aboral ends, 21 h after inoculation. In contrast, no spatial
                  difference in algal localization was observed in larvae
                  infected with heterologous symbionts. This result provides
                  evidence of functional differences among gastrodermal cells,
                  during development of the larvae. The cells in the larval
                  equator function as nutritive phagocytes, and also appear to
                  function as a region of enhanced symbiont acquisition in F.

                  polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) have greatly increased in
                  the peer-reviewed literature. The goals of the present review
                  are to assess the state of the science regarding toxicological
                  effects of PFAS and to develop strategies for advancing
                  knowledge on the health effects of this large family of
                  chemicals. Currently, much of the toxicity data available for
                  PFAS are for a handful of chemicals, primarily legacy PFAS
                  such as perfluorooctanoic acid and perfluorooctane sulfonate.
                  Epidemiological studies have revealed associations between
                  exposure to specific PFAS and a variety of health effects,
                  including altered immune and thyroid function, liver disease,
                  lipid and insulin dysregulation, kidney disease, adverse
                  reproductive and developmental outcomes, and cancer.
                  Concordance with experimental animal data exists for many of
                  these effects. However, information on modes of action and
                  adverse outcome pathways must be expanded, and profound
                  differences in PFAS toxicokinetic properties must be
                  considered in understanding differences in responses between
                  the sexes and among species and life stages. With many health
                  effects noted for a relatively few example compounds and
                  hundreds of other PFAS in commerce lacking toxicity data, more
                  contemporary and high-throughput approaches such as
                  read-across, molecular dynamics, and protein modeling are
                  proposed to accelerate the development of toxicity information
                  on emerging and legacy PFAS, individually and as mixtures. In
                  addition, an appropriate degree of precaution, given what is
                  already known from the PFAS examples noted, may be needed to
                  protect human health.},

                  studies the value and difficulties of using HCD in
                  interpretation of results of standard and higher-tier study
                  designs. HCD are routinely used in mammalian toxicology for
                  human health assessments, but not directly in ecotoxicology.
                  The possible reasons for this are discussed e.g., different
                  data types, the potential to mask effects, and the lack of
                  guidance. These concerns are real but not insurmountable and
                  we would like to see organisations such as OECD, EFSA and
                  USEPA develop guidance on the principles of HCD collection.
                  Hopefully, this would lead to greater use of HCD and
                  regulatory acceptance. We believe this is not only a
                  scientifically valid approach but also an ethical issue that
                  is in line with societally driven legal mandates to minimise
                  the use of vertebrate testing in chemical regulatory decision
                  making.},

                  produce offspring that initially lack zooxanthellae. This
                  study examined late larval development and the acquisition of
                  zooxanthellae in the scleractinian coral Fungin scutaria,
                  which produces planula larvae that lack zooxanthellae. Larvae
                  reared under laboratory conditions developed the ability to
                  feed 3 days after fertilization; feeding behavior was
                  stimulated by homogenized Artemia. Larvae began to settle and
                  metamorphose 5 days after fertilization. In laboratory
                  experiments, larvae acquired experimentally added
                  zooxanthellae by ingesting them while feeding. Zooxanthellae
                  entered the gastric cavity and were phagocytosed by endodermal
                  cells. As early as 1 h after feeding, zooxanthellae were
                  observed in both endodermal and ectodermal cells. Larvae were
                  able to form an association with three genetically distinct

                  suggests that the onset of symbiosis may influence larval
                  development; in one study symbiotic larvae settled earlier
                  than aposymbiotic larvae. Protein profiles of eggs and larvae
                  throughout development revealed a putative yolk protein
                  doublet that was abundant in eggs and 1 -day-old larvae and
                  was absent by day 6. This study is the first to examine the

                  cnidarian signaling pathways remain poorly characterized.
                  Cnidarians, especially hydras, are regularly used in toxicity
                  testing, but few studies have used cnidarians in explicit
                  testing for signal disruption. Sublethal endpoints developed
                  in cnidarians include budding, regeneration, gametogenesis,

                  remain how occurs. Steroid sex hormones are detected in corals
                  and sea anemones even though these animals do not have
                  estrogen receptors and their repertoire of steroidogenic
                  enzymes appears to be incomplete. Pathways associated with sex
                  hormone biosynthesis and sterol signaling are an understudied
                  area in cnidarian biology. The objective of this study was to
                  identify a suite of genes that can be linked to exposure of
                  endocrine disruptors. Exaiptasia diaphana were exposed to
                  nominal 20ppb concentrations of estradiol (E2), testosterone
                  (T), cholesterol, oxybenzone (BP-3), or benzyl butyl phthalate
                  (BBP) for 4 h. Eleven genes of interest (GOIs) were chosen
                  from a previously generated EST library. The GOIs are
                  17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases type 14 (17β HSD14) and type
                  12 (17β HSD12), Niemann-Pick C type 2 (NPC2), Equistatin (EI),
                  Complement component C3 (C3), Cathepsin L (CTSL), Patched
                  domain-containing protein 3 (PTCH3), Smoothened (SMO), Desert
                  Hedgehog (DHH), Zinc finger protein GLI2 (GLI2), and
                  Vitellogenin (VTG). These GOIs were selected because of
                  functional associations with steroid hormone biosynthesis;
                  cholesterol binding/transport; immunity; phagocytosis; or
                  Hedgehog signaling. Quantitative Real-Time PCR quantified
                  expression of GOIs. In silico modelling utilized protein
                  structures from Protein Data Bank as well as creating protein
                  structures with SWISS-MODEL. Results show transcription of
                  steroidogenic enzymes, and cholesterol binding/transport
                  proteins have similar transcription profiles for E2, T, and
                  cholesterol treatments, but different profiles when BP-3 or
                  BBP is present. C3 expression can differentiate between
                  exposures to BP-3 versus BBP as well as exposure to
                  cholesterol versus sex hormones. In silico modelling revealed
                  all ligands (E2, T, cholesterol, BBP, and BP-3) have favorable
                  binding affinities with 17β HSD14, 17β HSD12, NPC2, SMO, and
                  PTCH proteins. VTG expression was down-regulated in the sterol
                  treatments but up-regulated in BP-3 and BBP treatments. In
                  summary, these eleven GOIs collectively generate unique
                  transcriptional profiles capable of discriminating between the
                  five chemical exposures used in this investigation. This suite
                  of GOIs are candidate biomarkers for detecting transcriptional
                  changes in steroidogenesis, gametogenesis, sterol transport,
                  and Hedgehog signaling. Detection of disruptions in these
                  pathways offers new insight into endocrine disruption in
                  cnidarians.},

                  Hawaii, represents one of the most intensively studied
                  estuarine coral reef ecosystems in the world. Despite a long
                  history of anthropogenic disturbance, from early settlement to
                  post European contact, the coral reef ecosystem of Kaneohe Bay
                  appears to be in better condition in comparison to other reefs
                  around the world. The island of Moku o Loe (Coconut Island) in
                  the southern region of the bay became home to the Hawaii
                  Institute of Marine Biology in 1947, where researchers have
                  since documented the various aspects of the unique physical,
                  chemical, and biological features of this coral reef
                  ecosystem. The first human contact by voyaging Polynesians
                  occurred at least 700 years ago. By A. D. 1250 Polynesians
                  voyagers had settled inhabitable islands in the region which
                  led to development of an intensive agricultural, fish pond and
                  ocean resource system that supported a large human population.
                  Anthropogenic disturbance initially involved clearing of land
                  for agriculture, intentional or accidental introduction of
                  alien species, modification of streams to supply water for
                  taro culture, and construction of massive shoreline fish pond
                  enclosures and extensive terraces in the valleys that were
                  used for taro culture. The arrival by the first Europeans in
                  1778 led to further introductions of plants and animals that
                  radically changed the landscape. Subsequent development of a
                  plantation agricultural system led to increased human
                  immigration, population growth and an end to traditional land
                  and water management practices. The reefs were devastated by
                  extensive dredge and fill operations as well as rapid growth
                  of human population, which led to extensive urbanization of
                  the watershed. By the 1960' s the bay was severely impacted by
                  increased sewage discharge along with increased sedimentation
                  due to improper grading practices and stream channelization,
                  resulting in extensive loss of coral cover. The reefs of
                  Kaneohe Bay developed under estuarine conditions and thus have
                  been subjected to multiple natural stresses. These include
                  storm floods, a more extreme temperature range than more
                  oceanic reefs, high rates of sedimentation, and exposure at
                  extreme low tides. Deposition and degradation of organic
                  materials carried into the bay from the watershed results in
                  low pH conditions such that according to some ocean
                  acidification projections the rich coral reefs in the bay
                  should not exist. Increased global temperature due to
                  anthropogenic fossil fuel emmisions is now impacting these
                  reefs with the first "bleaching event" in 1996 and a second
                  more severe event in 2014. The reefs of Kaneohe Bay have
                  developed and persist under rather severe natural and
                  anthropogenic perturbations. To date, these reefs have proved
                  to be very resilient once the stressor has been removed. A
                  major question remains to be answered concerning the limits of
                  Kaneohe Bay reef resilience in the face of global climate
                  change.},

                  empirical articles published between 1974 and 2018 in top-tier
                  cognitive, developmental, and social psychology journals to
                  document how often psychological research acknowledges this
                  reality and to examine whether people who edit, write, and
                  participate in the research are systematically connected. We
                  note several findings. First, across the past five decades,
                  psychological publications that highlight race have been rare,
                  and although they have increased in developmental and social
                  psychology, they have remained virtually nonexistent in
                  cognitive psychology. Second, most publications have been
                  edited by White editors, under which there have been
                  significantly fewer publications that highlight race. Third,
                  many of the publications that highlight race have been written
                  by White authors who employed significantly fewer participants
                  of color. In many cases, we document variation as a function
                  of area and decade. We argue that systemic inequality exists
                  within psychological research and that systemic changes are
                  needed to ensure that psychological research benefits from
                  diversity in editing, writing, and participation. To this end,
                  and in the spirit of the field’s recent emphasis on
                  metascience, we offer recommendations for journals and

                  ecosystems have largely centered on endemic species and
                  ecosystems, and the people who rely on them. Fewer studies
                  have focused on the northward expansion of upper trophic level
                  (UTL) subarctic species. We provide an overview of changes in
                  the temporal and spatial distributions of subarctic fish,
                  birds, and cetaceans, with a focus on the Pacific Arctic
                  Region. Increasing water temperatures throughout the Arctic
                  have increased "thermal habitat" for subarctic fish species,
                  resulting in northward shifts of species including walleye
                  pollock and pink salmon. Ecosystem changes are altering the
                  community composition and species richness of seabirds in the
                  Arctic, as water temperatures change the available prey field,
                  which dictates the presence of planktivorous versus
                  piscivorous seabird species. Finally, subarctic whales, among
                  them killer and humpback whales, are arriving earlier, staying
                  later, and moving consistently farther north, as evidenced by
                  aerial survey and acoustic detections. Increasing ice-free
                  habitat and changes in water mass distributions in the Arctic
                  are altering the underlying prey structure, drawing UTL
                  species northward by increasing their spatial and temporal
                  habitat. A large-scale shuffling of subarctic and Arctic
                  communities is reorganizing high-latitude marine ecosystems.

                  processing of the wet biomass harvested from cultivation
                  sites. Efficient methods for the stabilization (i.e.
                  procedures to maintain the integrity and safety of the
                  biomass) and further processing of large quantities of
                  harvested raw material are still lacking as the development of
                  adapted technologies is often limited by significant capital
                  investment. This study investigates the concept of landing
                  facilities for the processing of cultivated seaweed biomass
                  (LFCS) shared among various stakeholders as a practical mean
                  to overcome these challenges. Qualitative data were collected
                  during interviews with relevant stakeholders from Norway and
                  abroad (including seaweed cultivators, technology suppliers
                  and industrial buyers of biomass) to describe the current
                  commercial applications for cultivated seaweeds as well as the
                  methods used for the stabilization and processing of the
                  biomass. This study showed that LFCS can give stakeholders the
                  opportunity to share the costs (investment, operational), thus
                  lowering the financial threshold for establishing efficient
                  strategies for processing large quantities of cultivated
                  seaweed biomass. It was identified that such a structure will
                  increase the synergy among industrial actors along the entire
                  value chain to stimulate innovation and facilitate the
                  production of high-quality products from seaweeds to relevant
                  markets (food, animal feed, nutraceuticals and cosmetics). It
                  can also lead to a higher degree of specialization in this new
                  industry. These premises will contribute to increase the
                  profitability of the emerging European seaweed sector.

                  used an experimental approach to demonstrate the occurrence of
                  environmental effects on sexual and asexual reproduction, and
                  provide evidence for sexual plasticity and inter-clonal
                  fertilization in laboratory-cultured lines of the sea anemone
                  Aiptasia diaphana. We showed that in A. diaphana, both asexual
                  reproduction by pedal laceration, and sexual reproduction have
                  seasonal components. The rate of pedal laceration was ten-fold
                  higher under summer photoperiod and water temperature
                  conditions than under winter conditions. The onset of
                  gametogenesis coincided with the rising water temperatures
                  occurring in spring, and spawning occurred under parameters
                  that emulated summer photoperiod and temperature conditions.
                  In addition, we showed that under laboratory conditions,
                  asexually produced clones derived from a single founder
                  individual exhibit sexual plasticity, resulting in the
                  development of both male and female individuals. Moreover, a
                  single female founder produced not only males and females but
                  also hermaphrodite individuals. We further demonstrated that
                  A. diaphana can fertilize within and between clone lines,
                  producing swimming planula larvae. These diverse reproductive
                  strategies may explain the species success as invader of
                  artificial marine substrates. We suggest that these diverse
                  reproductive strategies, together with their unique
                  evolutionary position, make Aiptasia diaphana an excellent
                  model for studying the evolution of sex.},

                  community composition in the endangered coral Acropora
                  cervicornis. Nine genotypes were fragmented and maintained in
                  one of four experimental treatments: 1) ambient conditions
                  (ambient seawater, no microplastics; AMB); 2) microplastics
                  treatment (ambient seawater, microplastics; MP); 3) global
                  change conditions (warm and acidic conditions, no
                  microplastics; OAW); and 4) multistressor treatment (warm and
                  acidic conditions with microplastics; OAW+MP) for 22 days,
                  after which corals were sampled for genome-wide GE profiling
                  and ITS2 and 16S metabarcoding. Overall A. cervicornis GE
                  responses to all treatments were subtle; however, corals in
                  the multistressor treatment exhibited the strongest GE
                  responses, and genes associated with innate immunity were
                  overrepresented in this treatment. ITS2 analyses confirmed
                  that all coral were associated with Symbiodinium ‘fitti’ and
                  16S analyses revealed similar microbiomes dominated by the
                  bacterial associate Aquarickettsia, suggesting that these A.
                  cervicornis fragments exhibited remarkably low variability in
                  algal and bacterial community compositions. Future work should
                  focus on functional differences across microbiomes, especially
                  Aquarickettsia and viruses, in these responses. Overall,
                  results suggest that when local stressors are coupled with
                  global change, these interacting stressors present unique
                  challenges to this endangered coral species.},

                  levels. The diverse and multilayered impacts of plastic on
                  biological health prompts an evaluation of these effects from
                  a One Health perspective, through which the complexity of
                  these processes can be integrated and more clearly understood.
                  Plastic particles ranging from nanometers to meters in size
                  are found throughout every ecosystem on Earth, from the
                  deepest marine trenches to the highest mountains. Plastic
                  waste affects all layers of biological organization, from the
                  molecular and cellular to the organismal, community, and
                  ecosystem-levels. These effects are not only mediated by the
                  physical properties of plastics, but also by the chemical
                  properties of the plastic polymers, the thousands of additives
                  combined with plastics during manufacturing, and the sorbed
                  chemicals and microbes that are transported by the plastic
                  waste. Using a One Health framework we provide an overview of
                  the following themes: 1) ways in which plastic impacts global
                  health across levels of biological organization, 2) how the
                  effects of plastic interact between layers of biology, and 3)
                  what knowledge gaps exist in understanding the effects of
                  plastic within and between biological scales. We also propose
                  potential solutions to address this growing crisis, with an
                  emphasis on One Health perspectives that consider the oneness
                  of animals, humans, and the environment.},

                  has resulted in a biodiversity crisis. Environmental pollution
                  is one of its drivers, including contamination of wildlife by
                  chemicals emitted into the air, soil, and water. Chemicals
                  released into the environment, even at low concentrations, may
                  pose a negative effect on organisms. These chemicals might
                  modify the synthesis, metabolism, and mode of action of
                  hormones. This can lead to failures in reproduction, growth,
                  and development of organisms potentially impacting their
                  fitness. In this review, we focused on assessing the current
                  knowledge on concentrations and possible effects of endocrine
                  disruptor chemicals (metals, persistent organic pollutants,
                  and others) in studies performed in South America, with
                  findings at reproductive and thyroid levels. Our literature
                  search revealed that most studies have focused on measuring
                  the concentrations of compounds that act as endocrine
                  disruptors in animals at the systemic level. However, few
                  studies have evaluated the effects at a reproductive level,
                  while information at thyroid disorders is scarce. Most studies
                  have been conducted in fish by researchers from Brazil,
                  Argentina, Chile, and Colombia. Comparison of results across
                  studies is difficult due to the lack of standardization of
                  units in the reported data. Future studies should prioritize
                  research on emergent contaminants, evaluate effects on native
                  species and the use of current available methods such as the
                  OMICs. Additionally, there is a primary focus on organisms
                  related to aquatic environments, and those inhabiting
                  terrestrial environments are scarce or nonexistent. Finally,
                  we highlight a lack of funding at a national level in the
                  reviewed topic that may influence the observed low scientific

                  climate change effects on sea surface temperature and
                  salinity, we used empirical downscaling to derive
                  high-resolution time series of future sea surface temperature
                  and salinity in Puget Sound (Washington State, USA).
                  Downscaling was based on scenario outputs of two
                  coarse-resolution Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase
                  6 (CMIP6) general circulation models, GFDL-CM4 and
                  CNRM-CM6-1-HR. We calculated 30-year climatologies for
                  historical and future simulations, calculated the anomalies
                  between historical and future projections, interpolated to a
                  fine-resolution, and applied these downscaled anomalies to a
                  Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) time series, yielding
                  short-term and long-term delta-downscaled forecasts.
                  Downscaled output for Puget Sound showed temperature and
                  salinity variability between scenarios and models, but
                  overall, there was a strong model agreement of future surface
                  warming and freshening in Puget Sound. Spatially, we found
                  regional differences for both temperature and salinity,
                  including higher temperatures in South Puget Sound and lower
                  salinity in Whidbey Basin. Interpreting and applying
                  downscaled CMIP6 projections of temperature and salinity will
                  help assess climate change vulnerability and inform future
                  ecosystem-based management decisions in Puget Sound and other
                  coastal and estuarine systems.},

                  constraints acting on dispersal stages are poorly understood
                  in many stony coral species. A key piece of missing
                  information is egg and sperm gene expression. This is critical
                  for broadcast spawning corals, such as our model, the Hawaiian
                  species Montipora capitata, because eggs and sperm are exposed
                  to environmental stressors during dispersal. Furthermore,
                  parental effects such as transcriptome investment may provide
                  a means for cross- or trans-generational plasticity and be
                  apparent in egg and sperm transcriptome data. Methods Here, we
                  analyzed M. capitata egg and sperm transcriptomic data to
                  address three questions: (1) Which pathways and functions are
                  actively transcribed in these gametes? (2) How does sperm and
                  egg gene expression differ from adult tissues? (3) Does gene
                  expression differ between these gametes? Results We show that
                  egg and sperm display surprisingly similar levels of gene
                  expression and overlapping functional enrichment patterns.
                  These results may reflect similar environmental constraints
                  faced by these motile gametes. We find significant differences
                  in differential expression of egg vs. adult and sperm vs.
                  adult RNA-seq data, in contrast to very few examples of
                  differential expression when comparing egg vs. sperm
                  transcriptomes. Lastly, using gene ontology and KEGG orthology
                  data we show that both egg and sperm have markedly repressed
                  transcription and translation machinery compared to the adult,
                  suggesting a dependence on parental transcripts. We speculate
                  that cell motility and calcium ion binding genes may be
                  involved in gamete to gamete recognition in the water column
                  and thus, fertilization.},

                  effects of the most widely used plasticizers, including
                  dibutyl phthalate, diethylhexyl phthalate, dimethyl phthalate,
                  butyl benzyl phthalate and bisphenol A (BPA), on wildlife,
                  with a focus on annelids (both aquatic and terrestrial),
                  molluscs, crustaceans, insects, fish and amphibians. Moreover,
                  the paper provides novel data on the biological effects of
                  some of these plasticizers in invertebrates, fish and
                  amphibians. Phthalates and BPA have been shown to affect
                  reproduction in all studied animal groups, to impair
                  development in crustaceans and amphibians and to induce
                  genetic aberrations. Molluscs, crustaceans and amphibians
                  appear to be especially sensitive to these compounds, and
                  biological effects are observed at environmentally relevant
                  exposures in the low ng l−1 to µg l−1 range. In contrast, most
                  effects in fish (except for disturbance in spermatogenesis)
                  occur at higher concentrations. Most plasticizers appear to
                  act by interfering with the functioning of various hormone
                  systems, but some phthalates have wider pathways of
                  disruption. Effect concentrations of plasticizers in
                  laboratory experiments coincide with measured environmental
                  concentrations, and thus there is a very real potential for
                  effects of these chemicals on some wildlife populations. The
                  most striking gaps in our current knowledge on the impacts of
                  plasticizers on wildlife are the lack of data for long-term
                  exposures to environmentally relevant concentrations and their
                  ecotoxicity when part of complex mixtures. Furthermore, the
                  hazard of plasticizers has been investigated in annelids,
                  molluscs and arthropods only, and given the sensitivity of
                  some invertebrates, effects assessments are warranted in other
                  invertebrate phyla.},

                  health, physiology, and response to environmental change.
                  However, there is substantial variation in the methodological
                  approaches applied. For example, DNA extraction protocols and
                  the types of tissues sampled from the coral meta-organism are
                  known to influence the downstream analyses of the amplified
                  microbial communities and subsequently the interpretation of
                  the microbiome diversity, stability and role. Studies have
                  generally focused on whole organisms, in which the coral
                  sampling steps homogenize the meta-organism microhabitats,
                  however other studies targeting specific microhabitats have
                  identified sources of variation specific to distinct

  abstract     = {Significance Microbial communities associated with coral reefs
                  influence the health and sustenance of keystone benthic
                  organisms (e.g., coral holobionts). The present study
                  investigated the community structure and metabolic potential
                  of microbes inhabiting coral reefs located across an extensive
                  area in the central Pacific. We found that the taxa present
                  correlated strongly with the percent coverage of corals and
                  algae, while community metabolic potential correlated best
                  with geographic location. These findings are inconsistent with
                  prevailing biogeographic models of microbial diversity (e.g.,
                  distance decay) and metabolic potential (i.e., similar
                  functional profiles regardless of phylogenetic variability).
                  Based on these findings, we propose that the primary carbon
                  sources determine community structure and that local
                  biogeochemistry determines finer-scale metabolic function. ,
                  Holobionts are species-specific associations between macro-
                  and microorganisms. On coral reefs, the benthic coverage of
                  coral and algal holobionts varies due to natural and
                  anthropogenic forcings. Different benthic macroorganisms are
                  predicted to have specific microbiomes. In contrast, local
                  environmental factors are predicted to select for specific
                  metabolic pathways in microbes. To reconcile these two
                  predictions, we hypothesized that adaptation of microbiomes to
                  local conditions is facilitated by the horizontal transfer of
                  genes responsible for specific metabolic capabilities. To test
                  this hypothesis, microbial metagenomes were sequenced from 22
                  coral reefs at 11 Line Islands in the central Pacific that
                  together span a wide range of biogeochemical and anthropogenic
                  influences. Consistent with our hypothesis, the percent cover
                  of major benthic functional groups significantly correlated
                  with particular microbial taxa. Reefs with higher coral cover
                  had a coral microbiome with higher abundances of
                  Alphaproteobacteria (such as Rhodobacterales and
                  Sphingomonadales), whereas microbiomes of algae-dominated
                  reefs had higher abundances of Gammaproteobacteria (such as
                  Alteromonadales, Pseudomonadales, and Vibrionales),
                  Betaproteobacteria, and Bacteriodetes. In contrast to taxa,
                  geography was the strongest predictor of microbial community
                  metabolism. Microbial communities on reefs with higher
                  nutrient availability (e.g., equatorial upwelling zones) were
                  enriched in genes involved in nutrient-related metabolisms
                  (e.g., nitrate and nitrite ammonification, Ton/Tol transport,
                  etc.). On reefs further from the equator, microbes had more
                  genes encoding chlorophyll biosynthesis and photosystems I/II.
                  These results support the hypothesis that core microbiomes are
                  determined by holobiont macroorganisms, and that those core
                  taxa adapt to local conditions by selecting for advantageous
                  metabolic genes.},

                  host-microbiome symbiotic relationships for the coral
                  holobiont health and development, although not all of the
                  mechanisms of interaction have been fully explored. Here, we
                  explore bacterial and metabolic shifts within coral holobionts
                  under thermal stress, and its correlation with bleaching. Our
                  results showed obvious signs of coral bleaching after 13 days
                  of heating treatment, and a more-complex cooccurrence network
                  was observed in the coral-associated bacterial community of
                  the heating group. The bacterial community and metabolites
                  changed significantly under thermal stress, and genera
                  Flavobacterium, Shewanella and Psychrobacter increased from
                  less than 0.1\% to 43.58\%, 6.95\% and 6.35\%, respectively.
                  Bacteria potentially associated with stress tolerance, biofilm
                  formation and mobile elements decreased from 80.93\%, 62.15\%
                  and 49.27\% to 56.28\%, 28.41\% and 18.76\%, respectively. The
                  differentially expressed metabolites of corals after heating
                  treatment, such as Cer(d18:0/17:0), 1-Methyladenosine, Trp-P-1
                  and Marasmal, were associated with cell cycle regulation and
                  antioxidant properties. Our results can contribute to our

                  coral-symbiotic bacteria, metabolites and the coral
                  physiological response to thermal stress. These new insights
                  into the metabolomics of heat-stressed coral holobionts may
                  expand our knowledge on the mechanisms underlying bleaching.},

                  essential to the animal’s health. Host-associated microbes

                  essential nutrients, interact with the host’s immune system,
                  and even regulate mood. However, it can be difficult to
                  preserve and obtain nucleic acids from some host-associated
                  microbiomes, making studying their microbial communities
                  challenging. Corals are an example of this, in part due to
                  their potentially remote, underwater locations, their thick
                  surface mucopolysaccharide layer, and various inherent
                  molecular inhibitors. This study examined three different
                  preservatives (RNAlater, DNA/RNA Shield, and liquid nitrogen)
                  and two extraction methods (the Qiagen PowerBiofilm kit and
                  the Promega Maxwell RBC kit with modifications) to determine
                  if there was an optimum combination for examining the coral
                  microbiome. These methods were employed across taxonomically
                  diverse coral species, including deep-sea/shallow, stony/soft,
                  and zooxanthellate/azooxanthellate: Lophelia pertusa,
                  Paragorgia johnsoni, Montastraea cavernosa, Porites
                  astreoides, and Stephanocoenia intersepta. Although
                  significant differences were found between preservative types
                  and extraction methods, these differences were subtle, and
                  varied in nature from coral species to coral species.
                  Significant differences between coral species were far more
                  profound than those detected between preservative or
                  extraction method. We suggest that the preservative types
                  presented here and extraction methods using a bead-beating
                  step provide enough consistency to compare coral microbiomes
                  across various studies, as long as subtle differences in
                  microbial communities are attributed to dissimilar
                  methodologies. Additionally, the inclusion of internal
                  controls such as a mock community and extraction blanks can
                  help provide context regarding data quality, improving

                  gametophytes at three different temperatures (4, 12, and 20°C)
                  characteristic for the species distribution range by using
                  RNA-sequencing. We identified several differentially expressed
                  genes (DEGs) between sexes; while female biased genes were
                  enriched in general metabolism and energy production, male
                  biased genes function within cell cycle and signaling. In our

                  only a small percentage of DEGs consistently male (7\%) or

                  They are often replaced by biologically depauperate alternate
                  stable states dominated by turfing algae. Hysteresis maintains
                  algal turfs by inhibiting kelp recruitment, preventing the
                  reestablishment of kelp forests. The mechanisms inhibiting
                  kelp recruitment remain poorly understood as microscopic
                  stages of kelp are difficult to study in situ. A potential
                  mechanism contributing to the suppression of recruitment may
                  be turf-facilitated grazing of kelp gametophytes, the haploid
                  free-living reproductive life stage. Here we assess the
                  resilience of kelp gametophytes to grazing pressure from a
                  gastropod micrograzer commonly present in turf under current
                  and future ocean warming scenarios. Gametophyte coverage and
                  abundance were significantly reduced following grazing under
                  all temperatures, however there was no significant effect of
                  temperature on grazing rates. Once grazing pressure was
                  removed, gametophyte abundance recovered to control levels,
                  but the total coverage and length of gametophytes continued to
                  decline in all treatments. Gametophytes were found to survive
                  micrograzer ingestion and continued to grow in aggregations in
                  the gastropod’s mucus trail and faeces, even producing
                  sporophytes. Gametophyte survival post-ingestion may
                  positively contribute to dispersal and sporophyte recruitment,
                  however the lack of gametophyte recovery at elevated
                  temperatures may counteract this effect under future ocean
                  warming. Taken together, this study demonstrates complex
                  interactions that take place in the turf micro-habitat of kelp
                  gametophytes and highlights biotic factors influencing

                  Gametophytes from northern Spain and Morocco exhibited very

  abstract     = {Organelles are intracellular compartments which are themselves
                  compartmentalized. Biogenic and metabolic processes are
                  localized to specialized domains or microcompartments to
                  enhance their efficiency and suppress deleterious side
                  reactions. An example of intra-organellar compartmentalization
                  is the pyrenoid in the chloroplasts of algae and hornworts.
                  This microcompartment enhances the photosynthetic CO2-fixing
                  activity of the Calvin-Benson cycle enzyme Rubisco, suppresses
                  an energetically wasteful oxygenase activity of Rubisco, and
                  mitigates limiting CO2 availability in aquatic environments.
                  Hence, the pyrenoid is functionally analogous to the
                  carboxysomes in cyanobacteria. However, a comprehensive
                  analysis of pyrenoid functions based on its protein
                  composition is lacking. Here we report a proteomic
                  characterization of the pyrenoid in the green alga
                  Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Pyrenoid-enriched fractions were
                  analyzed by quantitative mass spectrometry. Contaminant
                  proteins were identified by parallel analyses of
                  pyrenoid-deficient mutants. This pyrenoid proteome contains
                  190 proteins, many of which function in processes that are
                  known or proposed to occur in pyrenoids: e.g. the carbon
                  concentrating mechanism, starch metabolism or RNA metabolism
                  and translation. Using radioisotope pulse labeling
                  experiments, we show that pyrenoid-associated ribosomes could
                  be engaged in the localized synthesis of the large subunit of
                  Rubisco. New pyrenoid functions are supported by proteins in
                  tetrapyrrole and chlorophyll synthesis, carotenoid metabolism
                  or amino acid metabolism. Hence, our results support the
                  long-standing hypothesis that the pyrenoid is a hub for
                  metabolism. The 81 proteins of unknown function reveal
                  candidates for new participants in these processes. Our
                  results provide biochemical evidence of pyrenoid functions and
                  a resource for future research on pyrenoids and their use to
                  enhance agricultural plant productivity. Data are available

                  locations of different properties: a sheltered location, an
                  exposed location, and an offshore location. Published values
                  on the sinking speeds of organic particles from kelp were
                  used, spanning several orders of magnitude. Recent work on
                  quantifying the release of particulate organic matter from
                  farmed kelp was used to link the release of carbon to possible
                  cultivation volumes and scenarios, and finally to link this to
                  the potential for carbon loading on the ocean floor. The
                  results are presented in terms of loading and distribution per
                  unit harvested kelp, and the loading estimates are compared
                  with estimates of natural (background) primary production.
                  According to the simulation results, organic matter may be
                  transported anything from a few (hundred) meters up to a
                  hundred km away from the release site, depending on the
                  sinking rates, time of release, and the location. The depth at
                  which the matter settles on the sea floor likewise depends on
                  the properties of the matter and the sites. The time until
                  settlement varied from minutes to several hundred hours. The
                  results underscore the importance of constraining the

                  regarding its spread, control, and ecology in Kaneohe Bay,
                  Oahu, Hawaii. Its distribution in Kaneohe Bay during May
                  1976was nearly the same as when it was originally planted 2 yr
                  earlier. It lacked the ability to disperse over shallow
                  depressions both in the reef and in deep water , and it did
                  not colonize neighboring reefs without the help of man. Depth
                  was the single most important physical factor limiting its
                  dispersal. A total fresh weight standing crop of from 21 to 24
                  metric ton s of E. striatum was recorded on a 500-m-long
                  section of reef edge from December 1976 to June 1977. When
                  protected from grazing its growth rate was about 5.0
                  percent/day. Data support the conclusion that the population
                  on the reef edge was maintained only by a steady influx of
                  thallus fragments that escaped from enclosed experimental
                  plantings on the reef flat. When the experimental plantings
                  were removed the population could not maintain itself and soon
                  disappeared. Eucheuma striatum did not compete with native
                  algal macrophytes and appeared to be the basis of a community
                  richer in animal species than adjacent reefs. It provided
                  10-20 tons/me of food for grazing fish, shelter , and a
                  substratum for numerous invertebrates. Eucheuma striatum did
                  not attach to corals, but it did cause their death by shading.},

                  significant physiological responses of the coral Pocillopora

                  including response to toxin, drug meta­ bolic, and oxidation
                  reduction were triggered at the mRNA level. These results
                  implied that PAHs could be a group of slow-acting
                  environmental toxicants, whose effects were moderate but
                  persistent. Besides, it was interesting to find that PAHs
                  activated the neuroendocrine system in the coral by triggering
                  the expression of monoaminergic and acetylcholinergic system
                  related genes, indicating that PAHs might function as environ­
                  mental hormones. Moreover, the combined treatments of PAHs and
                  heat caused a much obvious effect on the coral and its algal
                  symbionts by elevating antioxidant activity and suppressing
                  photosynthesis in the symbionts. Results from the

                  stress responses upon PAHs and heat challenges through the TNF
                  and apoptosis pathways, which perhaps was modulated by the
                  neuroendocrine system of corals. Collectively, our survey
                  demonstrates that the PAHs can function as environmental
                  hormones and activate the neuroendocrine regulation in
                  scleractinian corals, which may contribute to the stress
                  responses of symbiotic association by modulating
                  photosynthesis, antioxidation, and apoptosis.},

                  the coevolution of new sequencing platforms and new software

                  Nevertheless, corals can be adapted to their thermal
                  environment and inherit heat tolerance across generations. In
                  addition, the diverse microbes that associate with corals have
                  the capacity for more rapid change, potentially aiding the
                  adaptation of long-lived corals. Here, we show that the
                  microbiome of reef corals is different across thermally
                  variable habitats and changes over time when corals are
                  reciprocally transplanted. Exposing these corals to thermal
                  bleaching conditions changes the microbiome for heat-sensitive
                  corals, but not for heat-tolerant corals growing in habitats
                  with natural high heat extremes. Importantly, particular
                  bacterial taxa predict the coral host response in a short-term

                  parallel responses of the coral and the microbial community to
                  living at high natural temperatures. A competing hypothesis is
                  that the microbial community and coral heat tolerance are

                  environment attracting attention from scientific and public
                  communities. Although we have sufficient evidence that
                  microplastic is ubiquitous in all ecosystems, the ques­ tion
                  of the harmfulness of microplastic exposure is still under
                  debate. Filter feeders like bivalves are commonly exposed to
                  microplastics in water and sediments and thus can serve as
                  excellent biological indicators for microplastic pollution. A
                  relatively rich toxicological literature has been focusing on
                  microplastic effects on bivalves but we have yet to reach an
                  agreement on the toxic effects and mechanisms of
                  microplastics. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis and
                  bibliometrics analysis of the microplastic studies in
                  bivalves. The bibliometric analysis (used to evaluate the
                  general research trends) showed that the investigation of
                  microplastic distribution in the marine environment and the
                  molecular mechanisms of microplastic toxicity are the two
                  major hot spots of research. Based on analyses of ecologically
                  and environmentally relevant microplastics concentrations,
                  particle sizes and polymer types, we discuss the physiological
                  effects of microplastics on bivalves, and the severity and
                  direction of the effects at the cellular, tissue, organ and
                  organismal levels. The meta-analysis results show that
                  microplastics can induce time-dependent oxidative stress in
                  bivalves. Generally, the activities of antioxidant enzymes,
                  such as glutathione peroxidase (GPx),
                  glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and superoxide dismutase (SOD)

  abstract = {Reef‐building corals can increase their resistance to heat‐induced
              bleaching through adaptation and acclimatization and/or by
              associating with a more thermo‐tolerant strain of algal symbiont
              (Symbiodinium sp.). Here, we show that these two adaptive pathways
              interact. We collected Acropora millepora corals from two
              contrasting thermal environments on the Great Barrier Reef:
              cooler, mid‐latitude Orpheus Island, where all corals hosted a
              heat‐sensitive clade C Symbiodinium, and warmer, low‐latitude
              Wilkie Island, where corals hosted either a clade C or a more
              thermo‐tolerant clade D. Corals were kept in a benign common
              garden to reveal differences in baseline gene expression,
              reflecting prior adaptation/long‐term acclimatization. Modelbased
              analysis identified gene expression differences between Wilkie and
              Orpheus corals that were negatively correlated with previously
              described transcriptome‐wide signatures of heat stress, signifying
              generally elevated thermotolerance of Wilkie corals. Yet,
              model‐free analyses of gene expression revealed that Wilkie corals
              hosting clade C were distinct from Wilkie corals hosting clade D,
              whereas Orpheus corals were more variable. Wilkie corals hosting
              clade C symbionts exhibited unique functional signatures,
              including downregulation of histone proteins and ion channels and
              upregulation of chaperones and RNA processing genes, putatively
              representing constitutive “frontloading” of stress response genes.
              Furthermore, clade C Symbiodinium exhibited constitutive
              expression differences between Wilkie and Orpheus, indicative of
              contrasting life history strategies. Our results demonstrate that
              hosting alternative Symbiodinium types is associated with
              different pathways of local adaptation for the coral host. These
              interactions could play a significant role in setting the
              direction of genetic adaptation to global warming in the two
              symbiotic partners.},

                  the microbiome has a role in the acclimatization of corals to
                  future ocean conditions. Here, we evaluated the
                  acclimatization potential of coral-associated microbial
                  communities of four Hawaiian coral species ( Porites compressa
                  , Porites lobata , Montipora capitata , and Pocillopora acuta
                  ) over 22-month mesocosm experiment. The corals were exposed
                  to one of four treatments: control, ocean acidification, ocean
                  warming, or combined future ocean conditions. Over the
                  22-month study, 33–67\% of corals died or experienced a loss
                  of most live tissue coverage in the ocean warming and future
                  ocean treatments while only 0–10\% died in the ocean
                  acidification and control. Among the survivors,
                  coral-associated microbial communities responded to the
                  chronic future ocean treatment in one of two ways: (1)
                  microbial communities differed between the control and future
                  ocean treatment, suggesting the potential capacity for
                  acclimatization, or (2) microbial communities did not
                  significantly differ between the control and future ocean
                  treatment. The first strategy was observed in both Porites
                  species and was associated with higher survivorship compared
                  to M . capitata and P . acuta which exhibited the second
                  strategy. Interestingly, the microbial community responses to
                  chronic stressors were independent of coral physiology. These
                  findings indicate acclimatization of microbial communities may
                  confer resilience in some species of corals to chronic warming
                  associated with climate change. However, M . capitata genets
                  that survived the future ocean treatment hosted significantly
                  different microbial communities from those that died,
                  suggesting the microbial communities of the survivors
                  conferred some resilience. Thus, even among coral species with
                  inflexible microbial communities, some individuals may already
                  be tolerant to future ocean conditions. These findings suggest
                  that coral-associated microbial communities could play an
                  important role in the persistence of some corals and underlie
                  climate change-driven shifts in coral community composition.},

                  population or species-level to communityand ecosystem-level
                  impacts and discuss avenues of research that can lead to

                  conservation research. DEB theory was first invented in 1979
                  in an applied institution for environmental quality assessment
                  and mitigation. The theory has since undergone extensive

                  increasingly integrated with ecology and conservation science,
                  the fundamental concept of scale is being recognized as
                  important, particularly for ensuring that physiological
                  knowledge is contextualized in a manner most relevant to
                  policy makers, conservation practitioners and stakeholders.
                  Failure to consider the importance of scale in conservation
                  physiology—both the challenges and the opportunities that it
                  creates—will impede the ability of this discipline to generate
                  the scientific understanding needed to contribute to
                  meaningful conservation outcomes. Here, we have focused on
                  five aspects of scale: biological, spatial, temporal,
                  allometric and phylogenetic. We also considered the scale of
                  policy and policy application relevant to those five types of
                  scale as well as the merits of upscaling and downscaling to
                  explore and address conservation problems. Although relevant
                  to all systems (e.g. freshwater, terrestrial) we have used
                  examples from the marine realm, with a particular emphasis on
                  fishes, given the fact that there is existing discourse
                  regarding scale and its relevance for marine conservation and
                  management. Our synthesis revealed that all five aspects of
                  scale are relevant to conservation physiology, with many
                  aspects inherently linked. It is apparent that there are both
                  opportunities and challenges afforded by working across scales
                  but, to understand mechanisms underlying conservation
                  problems, it is essential to consider scale of all sorts and
                  to work across scales to the greatest extent possible.
                  Moreover, given that the scales in biological processes will
                  often not match policy and management scales, conservation
                  physiology needs to show how it is relevant to aspects at
                  different policy/management scales, change the scales at which

                  management interventions must maximize efficiency and
                  efficacy. The relatively new field of conservation physiology
                  reveals the physiological mechanisms associated with
                  population declines, animal–environment relationships and
                  population or species tolerance thresholds, particularly where
                  these relate to anthropogenic factors that necessitate

                  an integrative approach between physiology, conservation and
                  policy, where each can inform the design, conduct and
                  implementation of the other. Each junction of the conservation

                  conservation science that applies physiological tools and
                  techniques to understand and solve conservation issues. While
                  a multi-disciplinary toolbox can only help to address the
                  global biodiversity crisis, any field can face challenges
                  while becoming established, particularly highly applied
                  disciplines that require multi-stakeholder involvement.
                  Gaining first-hand knowledge of the challenges that
                  conservation physiologists are facing can help characterize
                  the current state of the field and build a better foundation
                  for determining how it can grow. Through an online survey of
                  468 scientists working at the intersection of physiology and
                  conservation, we aimed to identify characteristics of those
                  engaging in conservation physiology research (e.g.
                  demographics, primary taxa of study), gauge conservation
                  physiology’s role in contributing to on-the-ground
                  conservation action, identify the perceived barriers to
                  achieving success and determine how difficult any identified
                  barriers are to overcome. Despite all participants having
                  experience combining physiology and conservation, only
                  one-third considered themselves to be ‘conservation
                  physiologists’. Moreover, there was a general perception that
                  conservation physiology does not yet regularly lead to
                  tangible conservation success. Respondents identified the
                  recent conceptualization of the field and the broader issue of
                  adequately translating science into management action as the
                  primary reasons for these deficits. Other significant barriers
                  that respondents have faced when integrating physiology and
                  conservation science included a lack of funding, logistical
                  constraints (e.g. sample sizes, obtaining permits) and a lack
                  of physiological baseline data (i.e. reference ranges of a
                  physiological metric’s ‘normal’ or pre-environmental change
                  levels). We identified 12 actions based on suggestions of
                  survey participants that we anticipate will help deconstruct
                  the barriers and continue to develop a narrative of physiology
                  that is relevant to conservation science, policy and practice.},

                  the potential to inform conservation policy has led to the
                  deﬁnition of the nascent discipline of “conservation
                  physiology.” Indeed, conservation physiology has much to offer
                  policy makers because of the rigorous experimental approach
                  and the focus on elucidating cause-and-effect relationships.
                  However, there remain a number of challenges that might retard
                  the adoption of this approach. Here, we identify these
                  challenges and suggest a path for both physiologists and
                  conservation practitioners to integrate their respective
                  ﬁelds. One issue is that threat assessments and conservation
                  actions tend to focus on populations or species, whereas
                  physiology tends to focus on individuals, cells, or molecules.
                  Physiologists must determine if and how the physiology of
                  individual organisms can inﬂuence population-level processes.
                  It is also necessary to validate more tools in the
                  “conservation physiology toolbox,” and ensure a thorough
                  understanding of the physiological biomarkers applied to
                  conservation efforts. Research on imperiled taxa will be more
                  useful to those making management decisions, rather than
                  research focused on model species. We also recommend changes
                  in the education of physiologists such that physiologists
                  understand the process of policy making, and the needs of
                  conservation practitioners.},

                  enormously from a complete and reliable holobiont gene
                  expression profiling. The most efficient way to acquire
                  holobiont transcriptomes is to perform RNA-Seq on both host
                  and symbionts simultaneously. However, optimal methods for
                  capturing both host and symbiont mRNAs are still under
                  development, particularly when the host is a eukaryote and the
                  symbionts are bacteria or archaea. Traditionally,
                  poly(A)-enriched libraries have been used to capture
                  eukaryotic mRNA, but the ability of this method to adequately
                  capture bacterial mRNAs is unclear because of the short
                  half-life of the bacterial transcripts. Here, we address this
                  gap in knowledge with the aim of helping others to choose an
                  appropriate RNA-Seq approach for analysis of animal
                  host-bacterial symbiont transcriptomes. Specifically, we
                  compared transcriptome bias, depth and coverage achieved by
                  two different mRNA capture and sequencing strategies applied
                  to the marine demosponge Amphimedon queenslandica holobiont.
                  Annotated genomes of the sponge host and the three most
                  abundant bacterial symbionts, which can comprise up to 95\% of
                  the adult microbiome, are available. Importantly, this allows
                  for transcriptomes to be accurately mapped to these genomes,
                  and thus quantitatively assessed and compared. The two
                  strategies that we compare here are (i) poly(A) captured
                  mRNA-Seq (Poly(A)-RNA-Seq) and (ii) ribosomal RNA depleted
                  RNA-Seq (rRNA-depleted-RNA-Seq). For the host sponge, we find
                  no significant difference in transcriptomes generated by the
                  two different mRNA capture methods. However, for the symbiont
                  transcriptomes, we confirm the expectation that the
                  rRNA-depleted-RNA-Seq performs much better than the
                  Poly(A)-RNA-Seq. This comparison demonstrates that RNA-Seq by
                  ribosomal RNA depletion is an effective and reliable method to
                  simultaneously capture gene expression in host and symbionts
                  and thus to analyse holobiont transcriptomes.},

                  expression. Here, we review recent literature that intersects
                  these two fields, summarizing themes across studies. Work in
                  model organisms, human biopsies, and cell culture demonstrate
                  that the gut microbiome is an important regulator of several
                  host pathways relevant for disease, including immune
                  development and energy metabolism, and vice versa. The gut
                  microbiome remodels host chromatin, causes differential
                  splicing, alters the epigenetic landscape, and directly
                  interrupts host signaling cascades. Emerging techniques like

                  and associated chemicals (combined or leachate toxicities) on
                  freshwater and marine microalgae. Forty-seven publications
                  from 2010 to 2020 were used in this review. Based on their
                  topic of focus, we classified the publications among the
                  following categories: single plastic toxicity, combined
                  toxicity of plastics and other chemicals, and toxicity of
                  leachates released from plastics. The test species Chlorophyta
                  and Ochrophyta were generally used to assess the impacts of
                  plastics on aquatic microalgae. This study identified the

                  disease, the ongoing, largest known panzootic of marine
                  wildlife, is unresolved. Here, we measured gene expression
                  longitudinally of 24 adult Pisaster ochraceus sea stars,
                  collected from a recovered site, as they remained asymptomatic
                  (8 individuals) or naturally progressed through SSW (16
                  individuals) in individual aquaria. Immune, tissue integrity
                  and pro-collagen genes were more highly expressed in
                  asymptomatic relative to wasting individuals, while
                  hypoxia-inducible factor 1-α and RNA processing genes were
                  more highly expressed in wasting relative to asymptomatic
                  individuals. Integrating microbiome data from the same tissue
                  samples, we identified genes and microbes whose
                  abundance/growth was associated with disease status.
                  Importantly, sea stars that remained visibly healthy showed
                  that laboratory conditions had little effect on microbiome
                  composition. Lastly, considering genotypes at 98 145
                  single-nucleotide polymorphism, we found no variants

                  worldwide in all marine compartments. Much research has been
                  carried out on adsorbed pollutants on plastic pieces and
                  hydrophobic organic compounds (HOC) associated with
                  microplastics. However, only a few studies have focused on
                  plastic additives. These chemicals are incorporated into
                  plastics from which they can leach out as most of them are not
                  chemically bound. As a consequence of plastic accumulation and
                  fragmentation in oceans, plastic additives could represent an
                  increasing ecotoxicological risk for marine organisms. The
                  present work reviewed the main class of plastic additives
                  identified in the literature, their occurrence in the marine
                  environment, as well as their effects on and transfers to
                  marine organisms. This work identified poly-brominated
                  diphenyl ethers (PBDE), phthalates, nonylphenols (NP),
                  bisphenol A (BPA) and antioxidants as the most common plastic
                  additives found in marine environments. Moreover, transfer of
                  these plastic additives to marine organisms has been
                  demonstrated both in laboratory and field studies. Upcoming
                  research focusing on the toxicity of microplastics should
                  include these plastic additives as potential hazards for
                  marine organisms, and a greater focus on the transport and
                  fate of plastic additives is now required considering that
                  these chemicals may easily leach out from plastics. (C)2017

                  or phthalic acid esters (PAEs) are ubiquitous in all the
                  environmental compartements. They have been widely detected
                  throughout the worldwide environment. Indoor air where people
                  spend 65–90\% of their time is also highly contaminated by
                  various PAEs released from plastics, consumer products as well
                  as ambient suspended particulate matter. Because of their
                  widespread application, PAEs are the most common chemicals
                  that humans are in contact with daily. Based on various
                  exposure mechanisms, including the ingestion of food, drinking
                  water, dust/soil, air inhalation and dermal exposure the daily
                  intake of PAEs may reach values as high as 70 μg/kg/day. PAEs
                  are involved in endocrine disrupting effects, namely, upon
                  reproductive physiology in different species of fish and
                  mammals. They also present a variety of additional toxic
                  effects for many other species including terrestrial and
                  aquatic fauna and flora. Therefore, their presence in the
                  environment has attracted considerable attention due to their
                  potential impacts on ecosystem functioning and on public
                  health. This paper is a synthesis of the extensive literature
                  data on behavior, transport, fate and ecotoxicological state
                  of PAEs in environmental matrices: air, water, sediment,

                  physicochemical properties of PAEs that control the behavior,

                  carbon pool that plays an important role in the global carbon
                  cycle. Investigation of the characteristics and behaviors of
                  DOM in some areas facilitates a better understanding of
                  biochemical processes in the water column. In February 2020,
                  water samples were collected to characterize the distribution
                  and optical properties of DOM from the Northern Andaman Sea
                  and the Northeastern Bay of Bengal. A high dissolved organic
                  carbon (DOC) concentration appeared in the Northern Andaman
                  Sea, which is strongly affected by the DOM contents of the
                  Irrawaddy and Salween Rivers. A barrier layer that resulted
                  from the freshwater input was observed above the thermocline.
                  This layer was believed to have had a consistent effect on the
                  concentration of DOM in the surface water and contributed to
                  the differences in DOC concentration on each side of the
                  Preparis Channel. Based on the fluorescence excitation
                  emission matrix and parallel factor analysis, four fluorescent
                  components were identified, including three humic-like
                  components (C1, C2, and C4 with their maximal Ex/Em at
                  ≤240/418 nm, 315/384 nm, and 270 (360)/442 nm and represented
                  as peaks A, M, and A+C, respectively) and one protein-like
                  component (C3 with maximal Ex/Em at 275/334 nm and represented
                  as peak T). The humic-like components were mainly derived from
                  terrestrial inputs. Low levels of humic-like components were
                  confined in the upper water, with strong photodegradation in
                  the euphotic zone. C3 was a typical tryptophan-like component
                  that represented freshly produced autochthonous DOM. The
                  correlation between C3 and biological index and apparent
                  oxygen utilization suggested that it was highly bioavailable
                  and not easy to be preserved in the deep sea. Overall, our
                  results showed the distributions of DOM in the Northern
                  Andaman Sea and the Northeastern Bay of Bengal and revealed
                  the behaviors and controlling factors for DOM in the upper
                  water.},

                  ecosystems, and substantial scientiﬁc effort has been expended
                  on investigating its effects, mostly in laboratory
                  manipulation experiments. However, performing these
                  manipulations correctly can be logistically difﬁcult, and
                  correctly designing experiments is complex, in part because of
                  the rigorous requirements for manipulating and monitoring
                  seawater carbonate chemistry. To assess the use of appropriate
                  experimental design in ocean acidiﬁcation research, 465
                  studies published between 1993 and 2014 were surveyed,
                  focusing on the methods used to replicate experimental units.
                  The proportion of studies that had interdependent or
                  non-randomly interspersed treatment replicates, or did not
                  report sufﬁcient methodological details was 95\%. Furthermore,
                  21\% of studies did not provide any details of experimental
                  design, 17\% of studies otherwise segregated all the
                  replicates for one treatment in one space, 15\% of studies
                  replicated CO2 treatments in a way that made replicates more
                  interdependent within treatments than between treatments, and
                  13\% of studies did not report if replicates of all treatments
                  were randomly interspersed. As a consequence, the number of
                  experimental units used per treatment in studies was low (mean
                  ¼ 2.0). In a comparable analysis, there was a signiﬁcant
                  decrease in the number of published studies that employed
                  inappropriate chemical methods of manipulating seawater (i.e.
                  acid– base only additions) from 21 to 3\%, following the
                  release of the “Guide to best practices for ocean acidiﬁcation
                  research and data reporting” in 2010; however, no such
                  increase in the use of appropriate replication and
                  experimental design was observed after 2010. We provide
                  guidelines on how to design ocean acidiﬁcation laboratory
                  experiments that incorporate the rigorous requirements for
                  monitoring and measuring carbonate chemistry with a level of
                  replication that increases the chances of accurate detection
                  of biological responses to ocean acidiﬁcation.},

                  pressure on ecosystems such as coral reefs that are already
                  challenged by climate change. However, the effects of plastic
                  pollution in combination with global warming are largely
                  unknown. Thus, the goal of this study was to determine the
                  cumulative effects of microplastic pollution with that of
                  global warming on reef-building coral species and to compare
                  the severity of both stressors. For this, we conducted a
                  series of three controlled laboratory experiments and exposed
                  a broad range of coral species (Acropora muricata, Montipora
                  digitata, Porites lutea, Pocillopora verrucosa, and Stylophora
                  pistillata) to microplastic particles in a range of
                  concentrations (2.5–2500 particles L− 1) and mixtures (from
                  different industrial sectors) at ambient temperatures and in
                  combination with heat stress. We show that microplastic can
                  occasionally have both aggravating or mitigating effects on
                  the corals’ thermal tolerance. In comparison to heat stress,
                  however, microplastic constitutes a minor stressor. While heat
                  stress led to decreased photosynthetic efficiency of algal
                  symbionts, and increased bleaching, tissue necrosis, and
                  mortality, treatment with microplastic particles had only
                  minor effects on the physiology and health of the tested coral
                  species at ambient temperatures. These findings underline that
                  while efforts to reduce plastic pollution should continue,
                  they should not replace more urgent efforts to halt global
                  warming, which are immediately needed to preserve remaining
                  coral reef ecosystems.},

                  a long-lived habitat-forming organism belonging to the
                  Corallium genus, which is present at almost all latitudes from
                  shallow-water to deep-sea habitats. When exposed to
                  microplastics, corals preferentially ingest polypropylene,
                  with multiple biological effects, from feeding impairment to
                  mucus production and altered gene expression. Microplastics
                  can alter the coral microbiome directly and indirectly by
                  causing tissue abrasions that allow the proliferation of
                  opportunistic bacteria. These multiple effects suggest that
                  microplastics at the concentrations present in some marine
                  areas and predicted for most oceans in the coming decades, can
                  ultimately cause coral death. Other habitat-forming
                  suspension-feeding species are likely subjected to similar
                  impacts, which may act synergistically with climate-driven
                  events primarily responsible for mass mortalities.},

                  dibutyl phthalate (DBP) and diethyl phthalate (DEP) on the
                  freshwater fish Cyprinus carpio. The median lethal
                  concentrations of DBP and DEP for 96 h are found to be 35 and
                  53 mg L-1, respectively. Fish were exposed to 3.5 mg L-1
                  (Treatment I) and 1.75 mg L-1 (Treatment II) of DBP and 5.3 mg
                  L-1 (Treatment I) and 2.65 mg L-1 (Treatment II) of DEP for a
                  period of 35 days. The DBP and DEP exposed fish show a
                  concentration based toxic effect on the selected parameters of
                  this study. The hematological parameters, such as hemoglobin
                  (Hb), hematocrit (Hct) and erythrocyte (RBC), were found to
                  decrease in the DBP and DEP treated fish, whereas their
                  leucocyte (WBC) count increased compared to that of the
                  control groups. A biphasic response is noted in the
                  erythrocyte indices, such as mean cellular volume (MCV), mean
                  cellular hemoglobin (MCH) and mean cellular hemoglobin
                  concentration (MCHC), throughout the study period. Exposure to
                  DBP and DEP caused a significant (p < 0.05) decrease in sodium
                  (Na+), potassium (K+), and chloride (Cl-) levels in the gill
                  and brain of the fish throughout the study period when
                  compared to that of their respective controls. The plasma
                  protein level decreased in all the treatments, whereas the
                  plasma glucose level significantly increased in the DBP and
                  DEP exposed fish. Maximum inhibition of Na+/K+-ATPase activity
                  was noticed in the gill and brain of the fish exposed to DBP
                  and DEP. The cholinesterase (ChE) activity in the brain of the
                  fish significantly decreased throughout the study period. A
                  significant (p < 0.05) increase in glutamate oxaloacetate
                  transaminase (GOT) and glutamic pyruvate transaminase (GPT)
                  activity was noted in the fish exposed to both toxicants. The
                  antioxidant enzymatic parameters such as superoxide dismutase
                  (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities were found to decrease in

                  significant (p < 0.05) increase in lipid peroxidation (LPO)
                  was observed. The above mentioned parameters could be used as
                  potential biomarkers in clinical trials for the assessment of

                  study assessed the effects of microplastics (Polyethylene

                  (Di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate; DEHP) on mortality, productivity,
                  population sizes and gene expression of the calanoid copepod
                  Parvocalanus crassirostris. Copepods were exposed to DEHP for
                  48h to assess toxicity. Adults were very healthy following
                  chemical exposure (up to 5120µg L-1), whereas nauplii were
                  severely affected at very low concentrations (48h LC50value of
                  1.04 ng L-1). Adults exposed to sub-lethal concentrations of
                  DEHP (0.1-0.3µg L-1) or microplastics (10,000-80,000 particles
                  mL-1) exhibited substantial reductions in egg production.
                  Populations were exposed to either microplastics or DEHP for 6
                  days with 18 days of recovery or for 24 days. Populations
                  exposed to microplastics for 24 days significantly depleted in
                  population size (60±4.1\%, p<0.001) relative to controls,
                  whilst populations exposed for only 6 days (with 18 days of
                  recovery) experienced less severe depletions (75±6.0\% of
                  control, p<0.05). Populations exposed to DEHP, however,
                  exhibited no recovery and both treatments (6 and 24 days)
                  yielded the same average population size at the termination of
                  the experiment (59±4.9\% and 59±3.4\% compared to control;
                  p<0.001). These results suggest that DEHP may induce
                  reproductive disorders that can be inherited by subsequent
                  generations. Histone 3 (H3) was significantly (p<0.05)
                  upregulated in both plastic and DEHP treatments after 6 days
                  of exposure, but not after 18 days of recovery. Hsp70-like
                  expression showed to be unresponsive to either DEHP or
                  microplastic exposure. Clearly, microplastics and plasticizers
                  pose a serious threat to zooplankton and potentially to higher
                  trophic levels.},

  abstract     = {Di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) is a plasticizer used in
                  the polyvinyl chloride industry worldwide. DEHP exists in the
                  aquatic environments for decades. However, the toxicological
                  effects of DEHP to aquatic organisms have not been adequately
                  researched. We investigated acute toxicity, oxidative damage,
                  antioxidant enzyme activities, and gene expression patterns of
                  antioxidant enzymes in juvenile and adult Daphnia magna
                  exposed to DEHP. We found that the median lethal
                  concentrations (LC50) of DEHP for juveniles exposed for 24 and
                  48 h were 0.83 and 0.56 mg L-1, respectively. The LC50 of DEHP
                  in adults exposed for 24 and 48 h were 0.48 and 0.35 mg L-1.
                  Daphnia magna that was exposed to DEHP had increased
                  malondialdehyde levels for 24 h and lower total antioxidant
                  capacity compared with the control. Activity levels of
                  antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase and phase II
                  detoxifying enzyme glutathione S-transferases were
                  significantly higher upon initial exposure for 24 h, and
                  enzyme activity was then diminished at high concentrations and
                  prolonged exposure for 48 h. Gene expression levels of cat and
                  gst were notably reduced or increased upon DEHP exposure.
                  These findings suggest that DEHP can cause biochemical and
                  physiological effects in juvenile and adult D. magna by
                  inhibiting enzymes, an increase in lipid peroxidation levels
                  and changes both transcription levels of enzymes (cat, gst).
                  On the whole, juveniles and adults both responded similarly to
                  DEHP. Our findings will contribute to the understanding of
                  toxic mechanisms in phthalate esters and the evaluation of
                  environmental risks in aquatic ecosystems.},

                  phenotypic changes in the host that could have epigenetic
                  underpinnings, such as methylation of CpG dinucleotides. We
                  leveraged the sensitivity to base modifications of nanopore
                  sequencing to probe the effect of symbiosis with the
                  chlorophyte Elliptochloris marina on methylation in the sea
                  anemone Anthopleura elegantissima. We first validated the
                  approach by comparison of nanopore-derived methylation levels
                  with CpG depletion analysis of a published transcriptome,
                  finding that high methylation levels are associated with CpG
                  depletion as expected. Next, using reads generated exclusively
                  from aposymbiotic anemones, a largely complete draft genome
                  comprising 243 Mb was assembled. Reads from aposymbiotic and
                  symbiotic sea anemones were then mapped to this genome and
                  assessed for methylation using the program Nanopolish, which
                  detects signal disruptions from base modifications as they
                  pass through the nanopore. Based on assessment of 452,841 CpGs
                  for which there was adequate read coverage (approximately 8\%
                  of the CpGs in the genome), symbiosis with E. marina was,
                  surprisingly, associated with only subtle changes in the host
                  methylome. However, we did identify one extended genomic
                  region with consistently higher methylation among symbiotic
                  individuals. The region was associated with a DNA polymerase
                  zeta that is noted for its role in translesion synthesis,
                  which opens interesting questions about the biology of this
                  symbiosis. Our study highlights the power and relative
                  simplicity of nanopore sequencing for studies of nucleic acid

                  (Symbiodinium muscatinei) and zoochlorellae (green algae;
                  Trebouxiophyceae, Chlorophyta). A seasonal comparison of
                  zooxanthellate and zoochlorellate anemones showed stable
                  symbiont population densities in summer and winter, with
                  densities of zoochlorellae about 4 times those of
                  zooxanthellae. Photosynthesis-irradiance curves of freshly
                  isolated symbionts show that the productivity
                  ($P_{\text{max}}$ cell) of freshly isolated zooxanthellae was
                  about 2.5 times that of zoochlorellae during July; comparable
                  rates were obtained in other months. Models of algal carbon
                  flux show that zoochlorellae may supply the host with more
                  photosynthetic carbon per unit anemone biomass than
                  zooxanthellae supply. Zooxanthellate anemone tissue was 2‰
                  (¹³C) and 5‰ (¹⁵N) enriched and zoochlorellate anemone tissue
                  was 6‰ (¹³C) and 8‰ (¹⁵N) enriched over their respective
                  symbionts, suggesting that zoochlorellate anemones receive
                  less nutrition from their symbionts than do zooxanthellate
                  individuals. The disparity between predicted contributions
                  from the algal carbon budgets and the stable isotopic
                  composition suggests that short-term measures of algal
                  contributions may not reflect actual nutritional inputs to the
                  host. Isotopic data support the hypothesis of substantial
                  reliance on external food sources. This additional nutrition
                  may allow both algae to persist in this temperate intertidal

                  hosts a single symbiont, the dinoflagellate Breviolum

                  abundance at sites on a gradient of exposure to estuarine
                  outflow, along with a fully crossed multifactorial lab

              zooxanthellae. This value decreases to 17\% when intertidal sea
              anemones are exposed to air for 15 h during daytime spring low
              tides, primarily owing to a reduction in photosynthesis by the
              algae, which are shaded when the anemone retracts its tentacles
              and contracts its marginal sphincter. Contraction of continually
              immersed anemones during peak irradiance likewise decreases their

  abstract = {ALONG THE PACIFIC COAST of North America sea anemones of the genus
              Antbopleura are dominant intertidal coelenterates. They occur as
              so~itary tide pool inhabitants (A . xanthogrammica) or as
              aggregations carpeting firm substrates (A. elegantissima). One of
              the unique features of these species is their invariable symbiotic
              association with unicellular Dinophyceae. These brown or
              yellow-brown algae, known as zooxanthellae, occur intracellularly
              in the gastrodermal tissues of the host anemone (Muscatine, 1961)
              . ' The influence of these symbiotic algae on the biology of
              Antbopleur« and on other anemones has been studied experimentally.
              The algae fix 14C02 and manufacture reduced organic carbon. Some
              of this carbon is translocated to the host anemone tissue where it
              is used in the synthesis of a wide range of animal constituents.
              In the absence of these algae, starved anemones lose weight faster
              than controls with algae. Thus, the adaptive value of the algae
              seems, in part, to be nutritional (Muscatine and Hand, 1958;
              Muscatine, 1961; Trench, 1968, 1969; Taylor, 1968, 1969). Within
              the past several years there have been unpublished reports
              concerning the occurrence of a green alga symbiotic with
              Antbopleur« from the American Pacific coast. Since the natural
              coexistence of more than one species of symbiotic algae in a given
              host is rare, it seemed to be of interest to investigate this
              phenomenon. This study describes an attempt to define the
              symbiotic status of the green symbionts in Antbopleura, using
              criteria from known symbiotic associations involving zooxanthellae
              and sea anemones. No attempt is made here to delve into the
              e:ology of the associations. A precise description of the green

                  surface temperature and gives rise to bleaching events that
                  affect coral reefs worldwide. In this respect, an impairment
                  of photosynthesis would be responsible for light-dependent
                  generation of toxic reactive oxygen species putatively
                  contributing to death of symbionts and/or host cells. In some
                  Symbiodiniaceae species, alternative photosynthetic electron
                  ﬂows (AEF) have been documented to occur upon a shift to high
                  temperature, possibly contributing to photoprotection and to
                  the balance of energetic ratio between photoproduced ATP and
                  NADPH. By using a combination of in vivo spectroﬂuorimetric
                  and oximetric techniques, we studied the capacity for electron
                  rerouting toward oxygen and cyclic electron ﬂow (CEF) around
                  photosystem I in eight Symbiodiniaceae in culture belonging to
                  Symbiodinium and Breviolum genera upon an acute shift from 25
                  to 33◦C. CEF capacity was determined as the kinetic of PSI
                  primary donor P700 re-reduction in the presence of DCMU, a
                  PSII inhibitor. An active oxygen uptake in light was estimated
                  by comparing net oxygen evolution and relative electron
                  transport rate of PSII at different light intensities. Among
                  strains that showed elevated capacity for both AEF, some were
                  thermotolerant while others were thermosensitive. Conversely,
                  in some thermotolerant strains, capacities for these AEF were
                  low upon acute heat stress. A principal component analysis of
                  these results indicates that the long-term heat
                  tolerant/bleached phenotype of cultured Symbiodinium and
                  Breviolum spp. is not correlated with a capacity for different

                  proliferation, differentiation, and response to stress, yet
                  its role in the regulation of intracellular symbioses is not
                  well understood. To explore host-symbiont cell cycle
                  coordination in a marine symbiosis, we employed a model for
                  coral-dinoflagellate associations: the tropical sea anemone
                  Aiptasia (Exaiptasia pallida) and its native microalgal
                  photosymbionts (Breviolum minutum and Breviolum psygmophilum).
                  Using fluorescent labeling and spatial point-pattern image
                  analyses to characterize cell population distributions in both
                  partners, we developed protocols that are tailored to the
                  three-dimensional cellular landscape of a symbiotic sea
                  anemone tentacle. Introducing cultured symbiont cells to
                  symbiont-free adult hosts increased overall host cell
                  proliferation rates. The acceleration occurred predominantly
                  in the symbiont-containing gastrodermis near clusters of
                  symbionts but was also observed in symbiont-free epidermal
                  tissue layers, indicating that the presence of symbionts
                  contributes to elevated proliferation rates in the entire host
                  during colonization. Symbiont cell cycle progression differed
                  between cultured algae and those residing within hosts; the
                  endosymbiotic state resulted in increased S-phase but
                  decreased G2/M-phase symbiont populations. These phenotypes
                  and the deceleration of cell cycle progression varied with
                  symbiont identity and host nutritional status. These results
                  demonstrate that host and symbiont cells have substantial and
                  species-specific effects on the proliferation rates of their
                  mutualistic partners. This is the first empirical evidence to
                  support species-specific regulation of the symbiont cell cycle
                  within a single cnidarian-dinoflagellate association; similar
                  regulatory mechanisms likely govern interpartner coordination
                  in other coral-algal symbioses and shape their
                  ecophysiological responses to a changing climate. IMPORTANCE
                  Biomass regulation is critical to the overall health of
                  cnidarian-dinoflagellate symbioses. Despite the central role
                  of the cell cycle in the growth and proliferation of cnidarian
                  host cells and dinoflagellate symbionts, there are few studies
                  that have examined the potential for host-symbiont
                  coregulation. This study provides evidence for the
                  acceleration of host cell proliferation when in local
                  proximity to clusters of symbionts within cnidarian tentacles.
                  The findings suggest that symbionts augment the cell cycle of
                  not only their enveloping host cells but also neighboring
                  cells in the epidermis and gastrodermis. This provides a
                  possible mechanism for rapid colonization of cnidarian
                  tissues. In addition, the cell cycles of symbionts differed
                  depending on nutritional regime, symbiotic state, and species
                  identity. The responses of cell cycle profiles to these
                  different factors implicate a role for species-specific
                  regulation of symbiont cell cycles within host cnidarian
                  tissues.},

                  patterns, preparation styles, knowledge and concerns about
                  microplastics, and demographics. Razor clams containing
                  suspected microplastics, primarily microfibers, were found at
                  all eight sites. Average suspected microplastic burden
                  differed by sample type (whole= 6.75 ± 0.60, gut-tissue= 7.88
                  ± 0.71, non-gut tissue= 4.96 ± 0.56, and cleaned samples= 3.44
                  ± 0.25). FTIR analyses of a random subset of microfibers in
                  whole and cleaned clams indicated material types of
                  polyethylene terephthalate, cellulose acetate, cellophane,
                  polyester, nylon, and cellulose. The average number of razor
                  clams consumed per meal by Olympic Coast recreational razor
                  clam harvesters was 4.27 ± 0.27, which varied by gender and
                  ethnicity, but not income or age. Harvesters ate 0–209
                  meals/year of razor clams (16.2\% harvested but did not eat
                  razor clams), and most respondents (88.3\%) fully cleaned
                  razor clams before consuming them. Annual suspected
                  microplastic exposure for razor clam harvester-consumers was
                  60–3,070 pieces for cleaned and 120–6,020 for whole clams. Our
                  findings suggest Olympic Coast recreational razor clam
                  harvester-consumers are exposed to low levels of microplastics
                  from eating razor clams. Microplastic exposure can be reduced
                  by roughly 50\% if clams are cleaned before consumption. Our
                  work serves as an important reference in the growing portfolio
                  of Pacific Northwest microplastic research, to inform future
                  microplastic attenuation recommendations and development of
                  human health standards for this type of pollution.},

                 area of research over the past 50 years. Although microplastics
                 threaten marine ecosystems in various ways, little is known
                 about their sink, vertical distribution or role in estuaries.
                 To address the lack of knowledge of the vertical distribution
                 of microplastics in estuarine systems, this study collects and
                 analyzes observational data across the water column in Puget
                 Sound using a series of net tows. Microplastics were visually
                 observed in all samples collected and the samples were
                 quantified to concentrations at each depth. The highest
                 microplastic concentration - 1.88x10 -4 g/m 3 - was found in
                 Possession Sound while the most consistent vertical profile was
                 found at Seabeck in Hood Canal, suggesting residence time is
                 more likely a driving factor to vertical distribution than

                 to determine spatial and temporal variation of microplastic
                 abundance across nine sampling stations. The stations were
                 located around the Puyallup River’s nearby wastewater treatment
                 plants (WWTPs) as these plants act as possible sources of
                 pollution. A majority of the data indicated that microplastic
                 abundance increased from 2017 to 2018 (P = 0.0287).
                 Additionally, the data demonstrated a positive correlation
                 between average microplastic abundance per city and total
                 population both years (2017 R2 = 0.8749, 2018 R2 = 0.6195).
                 Although spatial results were variable, abundance increased in
                 the Puyallup River between the two sites closest to Puget
                 Sound. 2018 data had a larger microplastic type distribution
                 than 2017 with 63 percent fiber and 37 percent fragment, while
                 2017 only had fibers. Puyallup River results were compared to a
                 study conducted on the Snohomish River in 2017. Mean river
                 microplastic abundance between the two sites showed no

                 2018 (P = 0.0008). Regulations on anthropogenic related
                 pollution are necessary as microplastics continue to accumulate
                 in the ocean. Further research with larger datasets and over

                 its malleable function, low production cost, and increasing

                 Created with the intention of short-term and one-time use, the
                 global production of plastic reached 299 million tonnes in
                 2013, with 10-20 million tonnes ending up in the oceans
                 annually. This study explores the contribution of microplastics
                 to the marine environment from river systems, and quantifies
                 the microplastic load within a stream as it passes from rural
                 to urban environments. The sampled river is fed by a remote,
                 glacially fed lake in the Cascadia Mountain Range, flowing into
                 the upper Skykomish River, the Snohomish River, and eventually
                 to the Puget Sound. Samples were collected by towing a 335 μm
                 mesh manta trawl during an ebb tide and analyzed, after a wet
                 peroxide oxidation and density separation, to quantify the
                 concentration of microplastics present in the stream. From the
                 16 samples analyzed, a trend has been found between the
                 quantity of plastics in the stream and the streams proximity to
                 the headwaters. This trend implies that the growing quantity of
                 microplastics within the stream, as it flows from rural to
                 urban environments, is supplied through anthropogenic
                 influences. This study has found 0.12 tonnes of microplastics
                 are transported every year by this river system, equating to
                 1.2 x 109 pieces of microplastics. Following this study,
                 microplastic pollution can no longer be thought of as a coastal
                 and marine issue, but rather a problem that starts much further

                 effects such as strangulation and digestive blockage in

                 either plastic produced in small pieces or fragmentation, have
                 only recently begun being researched. This study characterizes
                 macro and micro plastics in two NE Pacific estuaries, Puget
                 Sound, WA and Nootka Sound, Canada. Macro-plastic
                 concentrations were zero at all stations in both estuaries.
                 Average micro-plastic concentrations at the surface ranged from
                 0 pieces/m3 to 102 pieces/m3, 5 m depth concentrations were 0

                 relatively new in the science of oceanography, with the first
                 paper published in 1972. Since then, many papers have been
                 written in attempts to gain a better understanding of how and
                 where these plastics congregate in the world’s oceans, and what
                 issues arise in turn. Succinctly, this problem is ubiquitous
                 and openly threatens all marine biota. This paper examines the
                 link between higher concentrations of plastics with
                 anthropogenically active and highly populated regions. Six
                 stations were sampled for surface plastics in Puget Sound,
                 starting near Seattle, WA and ending in the open waters outside
                 of Nootka Sound, Canada. A modified Manta net was deployed at
                 each station. The samples were sieved, the plastic pieces
                 picked out under a microscope, counted, and placed into
                 labelled sample jars. Analysis showed higher concentrations
                 were found within Puget Sound, and lower concentrations in the
                 open ocean. A spike towards the high concentration end was also
                 measured near Victoria, B.C. This study furthers the continuous
                 realization that our ocean waters are accumulating plastic
                 pollution, and the largest concentrations are found in waters

                 environments, from surface waters to benthic sediments.
                 Microplastic in the oceans was first documented in 2004 and our
                 current knowledge of potential biological implications is
                 limited and rapidly growing. Thus far, we know marine organisms
                 are exposed to microplastics in natural settings, ingest
                 microplastics, and experience negative physiological impacts.
                 Many aspects of microplastics such as ingestion fate, extent of
                 trophic transfer, and effect on marine ecosystems remain
                 unknown. Motivated by the need to understand the impact
                 microplastic pollution has on our environment and our lives, I
                 investigated three aspects of the marine microplastic problem:
                 impacts on marine organisms, the ecosystem they support, and
                 the linkages between scientific research and public policy. In
                 nature, mussels experience a wide range of particle types and
                 concentrations, readily filtering microalgae and abiotic
                 particles other than microplastic. Mussel clearance rate is
                 sensitive to stress, making it a good indicator of stressful
                 conditions and polluted environments. In Chapter 1, I compare
                 mussel (Mytilus trossulus) clearance rates when exposed to two
                 different abiotic particles, microplastic and silt, across
                 multiple concentrations. I measure the clearance rates of
                 mussels exposed to increasing concentrations of three particle
                 treatments: Algae, microplastic + algae, and silt + algae. I
                 found that mussel clearance rate was inhibited by high
                 concentrations of microplastics but not silt. In the absence of
                 microplastic, mussel clearance rate was not dependent on the
                 addition of silt, total particle concentration, or algal
                 concentration. Mussels readily ingest microplastics in natural
                 and laboratory settings, raising concerns about particle fate.
                 Mussels are key benthic-pelagic couplers, concentrating
                 particles from the water column into dense and nutrient rich
                 biodeposits. In Chapter 2, I evaluate how microplastic changes
                 the benthic-pelagic coupling role of marine mussels (M.
                 trossulus). I expose mussels to feeding regimes with and
                 without microplastic and measure four attributes of
                 biodeposits: morphology, quantity of algal and microplastic
                 particles, sinking rate, and resuspension velocity. I found
                 biodeposits from the algae treatment contained more algal cells
                 on average than those from the microplastic treatment. Further,
                 biodeposits from the microplastic treatment sank slower and
                 resuspended at slower water velocities than biodeposits from
                 the algae treatment. To combat plastic pollution, there is
                 sufficient evidence that policies can lead to reduced plastic
                 production and consumption both locally and globally. In
                 Chapter 3, I examine global growth and spread of the marine
                 microplastic field in conjunction with growth and spread of
                 national plastic policies using scientometric and diffusion
                 methods. I conduct systematic literature reviews of marine
                 microplastic papers and national plastic policies through 2019.
                 At a global level, marine microplastic research and national
                 plastic policies have grown exponentially and remain in the
                 early phases of growth and spatial diffusion. Marine
                 microplastic publication spread at the institution level was
                 best explained by a hybrid of expansion and relocation
                 diffusion, while national plastic policy spread was best
                 explained by expansion diffusion. Taken together, findings from
                 Chapters 1 and 2 indicate mussels readily filter, ingest, and
                 egest microplastics, demonstrating their ability to transport
                 particles between benthic and pelagic habitats. When exposed to
                 microplastics, decreased clearance rate may result in fewer
                 particles removed from the water column and subsequently
                 available to benthic organisms. Further, decreases in sinking
                 rate and resuspension velocity of biodeposits containing
                 microplastic may increase dispersal distances, thus leading to
                 increased transport of both algal cells and microplastic
                 particles away from mussel beds. While extent of marine
                 microplastic research is not a good indicator of national
                 plastic policies, both the scientific field and national
                 efforts to reduce plastic pollution are spreading globally at
                 exponential rates. Marine microplastic pollution is a local,
                 regional, and global issue that require cross disciplinary
                 attention from researchers and policy makers around the world.},

              of the intertidal anemone Anthopleura elegantissima and its algal
              symbionts using a laboratory-based tank experiment. High
              intertidal anemones had lower baseline symbiont-to-host cell
              ratios under control conditions, but their symbionts had higher
              baseline maximum quantum yield compared to low intertidal anemone
              symbionts, despite identical symbiont communities. High intertidal
              anemones maintained greater maximum quantum yield and
              symbiont-to-host cell ratios under heat stress compared to low
              intertidal anemones, suggesting that high intertidal holobionts
              have greater thermal tolerance. However, thermal tolerance of
              clonal anemones acclimatized to different zones was not explained
              by tidal height alone, indicating emersion duration is not the
              sole environmental driver of physiological variation. Fixed
              genotypic effects also influenced physiological baselines, but did
              not modulate thermal tolerance, demonstrating thermal tolerance is
              largely driven by environmental history. These results indicate
              that this symbiosis is highly plastic and may be able to rapidly
              acclimatize to climate change, defying the convention that
              symbiotic organisms are more susceptible to environmental stress.},

                  withstand daily hyperoxic/anoxic transitions within their host
                  cells. Comparative studies between symbiotic (Anemonia
                  viridis) and non-symbiotic (Actinia schmidti) sea anemones
                  show striking differences in their response to oxidative
                  stress. First, the basal expression of SOD is very different.
                  Symbiotic animal cells have a higher isoform diversity (number
                  and classes) and a higher activity than the non-symbiotic
                  cells. Second, the symbiotic animal cells of A. viridis also
                  maintain unaltered basal values for cellular damage when
                  exposed to experimental hyperoxia (100\% O(2)) or to
                  experimental thermal stress (elevated temperature +7 degrees C
                  above ambient). Under such conditions, A. schmidti modifies
                  its SOD activity significantly. Electrophoretic patterns
                  diversify, global activities diminish and cell damage
                  biomarkers increase. These data suggest symbiotic cells adapt
                  to stress while non-symbiotic cells remain acutely sensitive.
                  In addition to being toxic, high O(2) partial pressure
                  (P(O(2))) may also constitute a preconditioning step for
                  symbiotic animal cells, leading to an adaptation to the
                  hyperoxic condition and, thus, to oxidative stress.
                  Furthermore, in aposymbiotic animal cells of A. viridis,
                  repression of some animal SOD isoforms is observed. Meanwhile,
                  in cultured symbionts, new activity bands are induced,
                  suggesting that the host might protect its zooxanthellae in
                  hospite. Similar results have been observed in other symbiotic
                  organisms, such as the sea anemone Aiptasia pulchella and the
                  scleractinian coral Stylophora pistillata. Molecular or
                  physical interactions between the two symbiotic partners may
                  explain such variations in SOD activity and might confer
                  oxidative stress tolerance to the animal host.},

  abstract     = {Ocean warming driven bleaching is one of the greatest threats
                  to zooxanthellate cnidarians in the Anthropocene. Bleaching is
                  the loss of Symbiodiniaceae, chlorophyll, or both from
                  zooxanthellate animals. To quantify bleaching and recovery,
                  standardised methods for quantification of Symbiodiniaceae and
                  chlorophyll concentrations have been developed for
                  reef-building scleractinian corals, but no such standard
                  method has been developed for octocorals. For stony corals,
                  quantification of Symbiodiniaceae and chlorophyll
                  concentrations often relies on normalisation to skeletal
                  surface area or unit of biomass (i.e. protein, ash-free dry
                  weight (AFDW)). Stiff octocorals do not change their volume,
                  as such studies have used volume and surface area to
                  standardise densities, but soft-bodied octocorals can alter
                  their size using water movement within the animal; therefore,
                  Symbiodiniaceae and chlorophyll cannot accurately be measured
                  per unit of surface area and are instead measured in units of
                  Symbiodiniaceae and chlorophyll per µg of host protein or
                  AFDW. Though AFDW is more representative of the full biomass
                  composition than host protein, AFDW is more time and resource
                  intensive. Here we provide a streamlined methodology to
                  quantify Symbiodiniaceae density, chlorophyll concentration,
                  and protein content in soft-bodied octocorals. This technique
                  uses minimal equipment, does not require freeze-drying or
                  burning samples to obtain ash weight, and is effective for
                  down to 0.2 grams wet tissue. Bulk samples can be centrifuged,
                  the Symbiodiniaceae pellet washed, and the supernatant saved
                  for protein analysis. This efficient technique allows for
                  clean, easy to count samples of Symbiodiniaceae with minimal
                  animal protein contamination. Chlorophyll a and c2 extractions
                  occurs at different rates, with chlorophyll a taking 24 hours
                  to extract completely at 4°C and chlorophyll c2 taking 48
                  hours. Finally, we found that where necessary, wet weight may
                  be used as a proxy for protein content, but the correlation of
                  protein and wet weight varies by species and protein should be
                  used when possible. Overall, we have created a rapid and
                  accurate method for quantification of bleaching markers in
                  octocorals.},

  abstract     = {Phytohormones are a class of small organic molecules that are
                  widely used in higher plants and microalgae as chemical
                  messengers. Phytohormones play a regulatory role in the
                  physiological metabolism of cells, including promoting cell
                  division, increasing stress tolerance, and improving
                  photosynthetic efficiency, and thereby increasing biomass,
                  oil, chlorophyll, and protein content. However, traditional
                  abiotic stress methods for inducing the accumulation of energy
                  storage substances in microalgae, such as high light
                  intensity, high salinity, and heavy metals, will affect the
                  growth of microalgae and will ultimately limit the efficient
                  accumulation of energy storage substances. Therefore, the
                  addition of phytohormones not only helps to reduce production
                  costs but also improves the efficiency of biofuel utilization.
                  However, accurate and sensitive phytohormones determination
                  and analytical methods are the basis for plant hormone
                  research. In this study, the characteristics of phytohormones
                  in microalgae and research progress for regulating the
                  accumulation of energy storage substances in microalgae by
                  exogenous phytohormones, combined with abiotic stress
                  conditions at home and abroad, are summarized. The possible
                  metabolic mechanism of phytohormones in microalgae is
                  discussed, and possible future research directions are put
                  forward, which provide a theoretical basis for the application
                  of phytohormones in microalgae.},

  abstract     = {Brassinosteroids (BRs) are known to protect crops from the
                  toxicity of herbicides, fungicides and insecticides. It is
                  shown here that application of 24-epibrassinolide (EBR)
                  accelerated metabolism of various pesticides and consequently
                  reduced their residual levels in cucumber (Cucumis sativus L).
                  Chlorpyrifos, a widely used insecticide, caused significant
                  reductions of net photosynthetic rate (Pn) and quantum yield
                  of PSII (ΦPSII) in cucumber leaves. EBR pretreatment
                  alleviated the declines of Pn and ΦPSII caused by chlorpyrifos
                  application, and this effect of EBR was associated with
                  reductions of chlorpyrifos residues. To understand how EBR
                  promotes chlorpyrifos metabolism, the effects of EBR on
                  activity and expression of enzymes involved in pesticide
                  metabolism were analyzed. EBR had a positive effect on the
                  activation of glutathione S-transferase (GST), peroxidase
                  (POD), and glutathione reductase (GR) after treatment with
                  chlorpyrifos, although the effect on GR was attenuated at
                  later time points when plants were treated with 1 mM
                  chlorpyrifos. In addition, EBR enhanced the expression of P450
                  and MRP, which encode P450 monooxygenase and ABC-type
                  transporter, respectively. However, the expression of GST was
                  consistently lower than that of plants treated with only
                  chlorpyrifos. Importantly, the stimulatory effect of EBR on
                  pesticide metabolism was also observed for cypermethrin,
                  chlorothalonil, and carbendazim, which was attributed to the
                  enhanced activity and genes involved in pesticide metabolism.
                  The results suggest that BRs may be promising, environmentally
                  friendly, natural substances suitable for wide application to
                  reduce the risks of human and environment exposure to

                  for the estimation of Chl a, b \& c1c2, and d in DMSO solvent.
                  The common unicellular green alga Chlorella sp. (Chl a \& b)
                  is used as an example of an oxygenic photo-organism with Chl a
                  as the primary photosynthetic pigment and Chl b as the

                  example of organisms containing only Chl a. The diatom
                  Chaetoceros sp. is used as the representative Chl a \& c1c2

                  significant storage problems with DMSO extracts of
                  chlorophylls because of its high freezing point (+18.4°C) and

                  solvents suitable for estimating Chl in extracts from natural
                  assemblages of algae. The presence of phaeophytin (Ph) a not
                  only interferes with estimates of Chl a but also with Chl b
                  and c determinations. The universal algorithms can hence be
                  misleading if used on natural collections containing large
                  amounts of Ph. The methanol algorithms are severely affected
                  by the presence of Ph and so are not recommended. The
                  algorithms were tested on representative mixtures of Chls

                  The limits of detection (and inherent error, ±95 \% confidence

                  The algorithms are both accurate and precise for Chl a and d

                  can be used to calculate a Chl profile of natural assemblages
                  of algae. The relative error of measurements of Chls increases
                  hyperbolically in diluted extracts. For safety reasons,
                  efficient extraction of Chls and the convenience of being able
                  to use polystyrene cuvettes, the algorithms for ethanol are

                  respond to environmental change. This, along with low cost and

                  Moreover, its accessibility can lead to misuse and
                  misinterpretation when the underlying photosynthetic processes
                  are not fully appreciated. This review is timely because it

                  Temperature, UV radiation and desiccation in low tide
                  conditions are usually considered the most important physical
                  stresses. These factors impact cell metabolism, and the
                  organism's ability to rapidly adapt to altering environmental
                  conditions sets its tidal distribution limits. The role of the
                  HSP70 protein (stress protein) family in thermal stress
                  responses has been widely demonstrated. Although it has been
                  shown that stress protein expression is a useful tool to
                  quantify part of this physical stress, few studies have been
                  made with different in situ intertidal organisms. To test
                  differences in HSP70 expression under natural conditions in
                  the intertidal environment, we chose a common cnidarian of the
                  eastern Pacific Ocean: the anemone Anthopleura elegantissima.
                  Polyp HSP70 expression depends on the degree of emersion and
                  the extent of physical stress (0.1-3.6 ± 1.5 ng HSP70 μg
                  Protein-1 were registered between fully immersed and fully
                  emersed polyps of the same clone). The time of immersion is
                  reflected in the recovery of polyp HSP70 levels from the high
                  tidal exposure (reaching again as shallower clones express
                  more HSP70 (2.5 ng HSP70 μg P-1), than deeper ones (0.1 ng
                  HSP70 μg P-1). Also sunny and foggy environmental situations
                  influence the stress response. Anemone clones exposed to the
                  sunny high intertidal zone express more than three times HSP70
                  (2.2 ng HSP70 μg P-1) than those on a foggy high intertidal
                  day (0.6 ng HSP70 μg P-1). For A. elegantissima, shrinking of
                  Polyps, mucus secretion, sand covering, UV absorbing
                  molecules, and a tight patch structure work concurrently with

                  emersonii and Chaetoceros muellerii). With increasing light
                  curve duration, the maximal relative electron transport rate
                  increased by a factor of three in E. radiata, and by factors
                  of 1.25 and 1.23 in C. emersonii and L. variegata,
                  respectively, but did not change in C. fragile and Ch.

                  Ch. muellerii and E. radiata with elevated light curve
                  exposure times. Oscillatory patterns of the continuous
                  ﬂuorescence readings reﬂect accumulation of QA. Continuous
                  ﬂuorescence values increased, or decreased, by approximately
                  10\% within light curve increments. However, oscillations of
                  25\% were not uncommon, which shows that cells are changing
                  their photophysiological response state during steady light
                  conditions. Increasing dark acclimation times prior to light
                  curve application lowered maximal relative electron transport
                  rates in the C. emersonii (from 28 ± 1.7 to 25 ± 1.2 for 15
                  and 95 min dark acclimation in short-duration light curves

  abstract     = {The Hawaiian Archipelago experienced a moderate bleaching
                  event in 2019—the third major bleaching event over a 6-year
                  period to impact the islands. In response, the Hawai‘i Coral
                  Bleaching Collaborative (HCBC) conducted 2,177 coral bleaching
                  surveys across the Hawaiian Archipelago. The HCBC was
                  established to coordinate bleaching monitoring efforts across
                  the state between academic institutions, non-governmental
                  organizations, and governmental agencies to facilitate data
                  sharing and provide management recommendations. In 2019, the
                  goals of this unique partnership were to: 1) assess the
                  spatial and temporal patterns of thermal stress; 2) examine
                  taxa-level patterns in bleaching susceptibility; 3) quantify
                  spatial variation in bleaching extent; 4) compare 2019
                  patterns to those of prior bleaching events; 5) identify
                  predictors of bleaching in 2019; and 6) explore site-specific
                  management strategies to mitigate future bleaching events.
                  Both acute thermal stress and bleaching in 2019 were less
                  severe overall compared to the last major marine heatwave
                  events in 2014 and 2015. Bleaching observed was highly site-
                  and taxon-specific, driven by the susceptibility of remaining
                  coral assemblages whose structure was likely shaped by
                  previous bleaching and subsequent mortality. A suite of
                  environmental and anthropogenic predictors was significantly
                  correlated with observed bleaching in 2019. Acute
                  environmental stressors, such as temperature and surface
                  light, were equally important as previous conditions (e.g.
                  historical thermal stress and historical bleaching) in
                  accounting for variation in bleaching during the 2019 event.
                  We found little evidence for acclimation by reefs to thermal
                  stress in the main Hawaiian Islands. Moreover, our findings
                  illustrate how detrimental effects of local anthropogenic
                  stressors, such as tourism and urban run-off, may be
                  exacerbated under high thermal stress. In light of the
                  forecasted increase in severity and frequency of bleaching
                  events, future mitigation of both local and global stressors
                  is a high priority for the future of corals in Hawai‘i.},

                  chemical shifts resulting in a long-term global decrease in
                  ocean pH, colloquially termed ocean acidification (OA).
                  Previous studies have demonstrated that OA can have negative
                  physiological consequences for calcifying organisms,
                  especially during early life-history stages. However, much of
                  the previous research has focused on static exposure to future
                  OA conditions, rather than variable exposure to elevated pCO2,
                  which is more ecologically relevant for nearshore species.
                  This study examines the effects of OA on embryonic and larval
                  Pacific razor clams (Siliqua patula), a bivalve that produces
                  a concretion during early shell development. Larvae were
                  spawned and cultured over 28 days under three pCO2 treatments:
                  a static high pCO2 of 867 μatm, a variable, diel pCO2 of 357
                  to 867 μatm, and an ambient pCO2 of 357 μatm. Our results
                  indicate that the calcium carbonate polymorphism of the
                  concretion phase of S. patula was amorphous calcium carbonate
                  which transitioned to vaterite during the advanced D-veliger
                  stage, with a final polymorphic shift to aragonite in adults,
                  suggesting an increased vulnerability to dissolution under OA.
                  However, exposure to elevated pCO2 appeared to accelerate the
                  transition of larval S. patula from the concretion stage of
                  shell development to complete calcification. There was no
                  significant impact of OA exposure to elevated or variable pCO2
                  conditions on S. patula growth or HSP70 and calmodulin gene
                  expression. This is the first experimental study examining the
                  response of a concretion producing bivalve to future predicted
                  OA conditions and has important implications for
                  experimentation on larval mollusks and bivalve management.},

                  on a high latitude coral reef. The symbiotic dinoflagellates
                  from 2 species of reef-building coral (Porites cylindnca and
                  Stylophora pistillata) showed photoinhibitory decreases in the
                  ratio of variable (F,) to maximal (F,) fluorescence (F,/F,,,)
                  as early as 09:00 h on both summer and winter days on the
                  reefs associated wlth One Tree Island (23" 30'S, 1.52" 06' E;
                  Great Barrier Reef, Australia). This was due to decreases in
                  maximum, F,, and to a smaller extent minimum, F,, chlorophyll
                  fluorescence. Complete recovery took 4 to 6 h and began to
                  occur as soon as light levels fell each day. Chlorophyll
                  fluorescence quenching analysis of corals measured during the
                  early afternoon revealed classic regulation of photosystem I1
                  (PSII) efficiency through non-photochemical quenching
                  (NPQ).These results appear to be similar to data collected for
                  other algae and higher plants, suggesting involvement of the
                  xanthophyll cycle of symbiotic dinoflagellates in regulating
                  the quantum efficiency of PSII. The ability of symbiotic
                  dinoflagellates to develop significant NPQ, however, depended
                  strongly on when the symbiotic dinoflagellates were studied.
                  Whereas symbiotic dinoflagellates from corals in the early
                  afternoon showed a significant capacity to regulate the
                  efficiency of PSII using NPQ, those sampled before sunrise had
                  a slower and much reduced capacity, suggesting that elements
                  of the xanthophyll cycle are suppressed prior to sunrise. A
                  second major finding of this study is that the quantum
                  efficiency of PSII in symbiotic dinoflagellates is strongly
                  diurnal, and is as much as 50 \% lower just prior to sunrise
                  than later in the day. When combmed with oxygen flux data,
                  these results indicate that a greater portion of the electron
                  transport occurring later in the day is likely to be due to
                  the increases in the rate of carbon fixation by Rubisco or to
                  higher fluxes through the MeNer-Ascorbate-Peroxidase

                  sunlight and carbon dioxide into organic carbon and oxygen to
                  fuel coral growth and calcification, creating habitat for
                  these diverse and productive ecosystems. Light is thus a key
                  regulating factor shaping the productivity, physiology, and
                  ecology of the coral holobiont. Similar to all oxygenic
                  photoautotrophs, Symbiodinium must safely harvest sunlight for
                  photosynthesis and dissipate excess energy to prevent
                  oxidative stress. Oxidative stress is caused by environmental
                  stressors such as those associated with global climate change,
                  and ultimately leads to breakdown of the coral–algal symbiosis

                  bleaching events have become pervasive and frequent

                  coral–algal symbiosis is the biological engine producing the

                  focus on the photophysiological responses and timescales of

                  the light environment and its dynamics, the vulnerability of
                  the symbiosis to oxidative stress, the abiotic and biotic

                  scars (without verrucae) and that of old scars (with
                  developing verrucae) were used to examine the seasonality of
                  the division process at Cattle Point, San Juan Island,
                  Washington State, USA. Divisions can occur at any time of year
                  but are most frequent during August to February. Body size
                  increased over the spring and summer (April—August) and
                  decreased over the fall and winter (September—March) in
                  population samples and in monitored experimental clones.
                  Frequency of division was positively correlated with a
                  seasonal decrease of anemone basal diameter in the field.
                  Division was least common during the period of rapid
                  individual growth in the spring and early summer. When
                  compared at the annual peak of body size it was the larger
                  individuals that went on to divide over the fall and winter.
                  Agonistic interactions (acrorhagial response, Francis 1973b)
                  were used to examine the spatial extent of clonal aggregations
                  at three field sites. Single clones were often discontinuous
                  and were distributed over areas up to 100 m2. Clone size
                  increased from exposed to protected locations and from exposed
                  (convex) to protected (concave) microhabitat.},

  abstract     = {A comprehensive understanding of coral reproduction and
                  development is needed because corals are threatened in many
                  ways by human activity. Major threats include the loss of
                  their photosynthetic symbionts (Symbiodinium) caused by rising
                  temperatures (bleaching), reduced ability to calcify caused by
                  ocean acidification, increased storm severity associated with
                  global climate change and an increase in predators caused by
                  runoff from human agricultural activity. In spite of these
                  threats, detailed descriptions of embryonic development are
                  not available for many coral species. The current consensus is
                  that there are two major groups of stony corals, the "complex"
                  and the "robust". In this paper we describe the embryonic
                  development of four "complex" species, Pseudosiderastrea
                  tayamai, Galaxea fascicularis, Montipora hispida, and Pavona
                  Decussata, and seven "robust" species, Oulastrea crispata,
                  Platygyra contorta, Favites abdita, Echinophyllia aspera,
                  Goniastrea favulus, Dipsastraea speciosa (previously Favia
                  speciosa), and Phymastrea valenciennesi (previously Montastrea
                  valenciennesi). Data from both histologically sectioned
                  embryos and whole mounts are presented. One apparent
                  difference between these two major groups is that before
                  gastrulation the cells of the complex corals thus far
                  described (mainly Acropora species) spread and flatten to
                  produce the so-called prawn chip, which lacks a blastocoel.
                  Our present broad survey of robust and complex corals reveals
                  that prawn chip formation is not a synapomorphy of complex
                  corals, as Pavona Decussata does not form a prawn chip and has
                  a well-developed blastocoel. Although prawn chip formation
                  cannot be used to separate the two clades, none of the robust
                  corals which we surveyed has such a stage. Many robust coral
                  embryos pass through two periods of invagination, separated by
                  a return to a spherical shape. However, only the second of
                  these periods is associated with endoderm formation. We have
                  therefore termed the first invagination a pseudo-blastopore.},

                  organisms and may play a significant role in dictating the
                  phenotypic range of traits in coral offspring, influencing
                  their ability to survive environmental challenges. This study
                  explored parental effects and life-stage differences in the
                  Hawaiian reef-building coral Montipora capitata from different
                  environments by examining the biochemical composition of
                  mature coral colonies and their eggs. Our results indicate
                  that there are large biochemical differences between adults
                  and eggs, with the latter containing higher concentration of
                  lipids (mostly wax esters), ubiquitinated proteins (which may
                  indicate high turnover rate of proteins) and antioxidants
                  (e.g., manganese superoxide dismutase). Adults displayed high
                  phenotypic plasticity, with corals from a high-light
                  environment having more wax esters, lighter tissue δ13C
                  signatures and higher Symbiodinium densities than adults from
                  the low-light environment who had higher content of accessory
                  pigments. A green-algal pigment (α-carotene) and powerful
                  antioxidant was present in eggs; it is unclear whether this
                  pigment is acquired from heterotrophic food sources or from
                  endolithic green algae living in the adult coral skeletons.
                  Despite the broad phenotypic plasticity displayed by adults,
                  parental investment in the context of provisioning of energy
                  reserves and antioxidant defense was the same in eggs from the
                  different sites. Such equality in investment maximizes the
                  capacity of all embryos and larvae to cope with challenging
                  conditions associated with floating at the surface and to
                  disperse successfully until an appropriate habitat for

  abstract     = {The majority of scleractinian corals are hermaphrodites that
                  broadcast spawn their gametes separately or packaged as
                  egg–sperm bundles during spawning events that are timed to the
                  lunar cycle. The egg–sperm bundle is an efficient way of
                  transporting gametes to the ocean surface where fertilization
                  takes place, while minimizing sperm dilution and maximizing
                  the opportunity for gamete encounters during a spawning event.
                  To date, there are few studies that focus on the formation and
                  structure of egg–sperm bundle. This study explores formation,
                  ultrastructure, and longevity of the egg–sperm bundle in
                  Montipora capitata, a major reef building coral in Hawai‘i.
                  Our results show that the egg–sperm bundle is formed by a
                  mucus layer secreted by the oocytes. The sperm package is
                  located at the center of each bundle, possibly reflecting the
                  development of male and female gametes in different
                  mesenteries. Once the egg–sperm bundle has reached the ocean
                  surface, it breaks open within 10–35 min, depending on the
                  environmental conditions (i.e., wind, water turbulence).
                  Although the bundle has an ephemeral life span, the formation
                  of an egg–sperm bundle is a fundamental part of the
                  reproductive process that could be strongly influenced by
                  climate change and deterioration of water quality (due to
                  anthropogenic effects) and thus requires further

                  biosynthesis, metabolism, and protein/RNA processing and
                  transport functions. The first MZT wave occurs from ~4-14 hpf
                  and is enriched in terms related to biosynthesis, methylation,
                  cell division, and transcription. In contrast, functional
                  enrichment in the second MZT wave, or ZGA, from 22 hpf9dpf,
                  includes ion/peptide transport and cell signaling. Finally,
                  adult expression is enriched for functions related to
                  signaling, metabolism, and ion/peptide transport. Our proposed
                  MZT timing is further supported by expression of enzymes
                  involved in zygotic transcriptional repression (Kaiso) and
                  activation (Sox2), which peak at 14 hpf and 22 hpf,
                  respectively. Further, DNA methylation writing (DNMT3a) and
                  removing (TET1) enzymes peak and remain stable past ~4 hpf,
                  suggesting that methylome programming occurs before 4 hpf.
                  Conclusions: Our high-resolution insight into the coral
                  maternal mRNA and MZT provides essential baseline information
                  to understand parental carryover effects and the sensitivity
                  of developmental success under increasing environmental
                  stress.},

                  coral reefs by impacting reproduction and accelerating coral
                  loss. Adult corals depend on nutritional exchange with their
                  endosymbiotic algae (Symbiodiniaceae) to fulfill their
                  energetic demands. However, the mechanisms underlying the
                  onset of this exchange during early life stages and how it
                  contributes to developmental energy demands are unclear. We
                  conducted an integrative analysis of the dependence on
                  nutritional exchange across developmental stages in Montipora
                  capitata, a vertically transmitting coral (Symbiodiniaceae are
                  passed from parent to offspring) in Hawai□i. We applied
                  physiological (metabolism and symbiont density) and multi-omic
                  (metabolomics, transcriptomics, and microbial amplicon
                  sequencing) approaches over 13 time points (1-255 hours
                  post-fertilization; eggs, embryos, larvae, and recruits) to
                  understand ontogenetic shifts in metabolism. Energetic demand
                  (respiration) and symbiont population photosynthetic capacity
                  (photosynthesis and cell density) increased with development,
                  and metabolism shifted from using stored reserves to relying
                  on symbiont-derived resources. Specifically, pathways
                  associated with nutritional exchange, including organic
                  compound transport, glucose and fatty acid metabolism,
                  nitrogen metabolism, and reactive oxygen regulation were
                  enriched in larvae. Recruits expanded utilization of
                  carbohydrate and lipid pathways in response to the energetic
                  demands of settlement and calcification. Our study shows that
                  symbiotic nutritional exchange buffers the energetic demands
                  of development in vertically transmitting corals, suggesting
                  that in environmentally stressful conditions, these stages may
                  be increasingly vulnerable to the loss of symbiont-derived
                  nutrition. Therefore, intervening early to reduce stress
                  during sensitive developmental stages could enhance coral reef
                  recruitment and recovery as climate change intensifies.},

  abstract     = {Identifying processes that promote coral reef recovery and
                  resilience is crucial as ocean warming becomes more frequent
                  and severe. Sexual reproduction is essential for the
                  replenishment of coral populations and maintenance of genetic
                  diversity; however, the ability for corals to reproduce may be
                  impaired by marine heatwaves that cause coral bleaching. In
                  2014 and 2015, the Hawaiian Islands experienced coral
                  bleaching with differential bleaching susceptibility in the
                  species Montipora capitata, a dominant reef-building coral in
                  the region. We tested the hypothesis that coral bleaching
                  resistance enhances reproductive capacity and offspring
                  performance by examining the reproductive biology of colonies
                  that bleached and recovered (B) and colonies that did not
                  bleach (NB) in 2015 in the subsequent spawning seasons. The
                  proportion of colonies that spawned was higher in 2016 than in
                  2017. Regardless of parental bleaching history, we found eggs
                  with higher abnormality and bundles with fewer eggs in 2016
                  than 2017. While reproductive output was similar between B and
                  NB colonies in 2016, survivorship of offspring that year were
                  significantly influenced by the parental bleaching history
                  (egg donor × sperm donor: B × B, B × NB, NB × B, and NB × NB).
                  Offspring produced by NB egg donors had the highest
                  survivorship, while offspring from previously bleached
                  colonies had the lowest survivorship, highlighting the
                  negative effects of bleaching on parental investment and
                  offspring performance. While sexual reproduction continues in
                  M. capitata post-bleaching, gametes are differentially
                  impacted by recovery time following a bleaching event and by
                  parental bleaching resistance. Our results demonstrate the
                  importance of identifying bleaching resistant individuals
                  during and after heating events. This study further highlights
                  the significance of maternal effects through potential egg
                  provisioning for offspring survivorship and provides a
                  baseline for human-assisted intervention (i.e., selective
                  breeding) to mitigate the effects of climate change on coral

                  marine environments and associated with endocrine-disrupting
                  processes. However, our knowledge regarding the impact of
                  endocrine-disrupting PAs on coral-reef organisms is limited.
                  As reef population structure is directly linked to
                  reproduction and larval settlement processes, interference
                  with hormonal systems can impact coral-reef community
                  structure, particularly if the effects of PAs differ among
                  species. In the current study we exposed the reproductive
                  products of four tropical coral-reef invertebrates to
                  environmentally-relevant concentrations of four prevalent PAs
                  in seawater: dibutyl phthalate (DBP), dimethyl phthalate,
                  (DMP), 4-nonylphenol (4-NP), and bisphenol A (BPA), as well as
                  to 103 higher laboratory concentrations of these PAs. Our
                  results revealed that apart from the significant negative
                  effect of the 1 μg/L of 4-NP on the settlement of the soft
                  coral Rhytisma fulvum, none of the other tested materials
                  demonstrated a significant effect on the exposed organisms at
                  environmentally-relevant concentrations in seawater. The 4-NP
                  high laboratory concentration (1000 μg/L), however, had
                  significant negative effects on all the examined species. The
                  high laboratory BPA concentration (1000 μg/L) significantly
                  reduced fertilization success in the solitary ascidian
                  Herdmaniamomus, up to its complete failure to reproduce.
                  Moreover, the high laboratory DMP concentration (100 μg/L) had
                  a significant negative effect on planulae settlement of the
                  stony coral Stylophora pistillata. Our findings demonstrate
                  the negative and selective effects of PAs on the development
                  and reproduction of coral-reef organisms; and, specifically,
                  the significant effect found following exposure to 4-NP.
                  Consequently, if we aim to fully understand the impact of
                  these contaminants on this endangered ecosystem, we suggest
                  that the actual concentrations within the living organism
                  tissues should be tested in order to produce relevant risk
                  assessments for brooding-coral species.},
