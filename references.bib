              phthalate (MEHP; n = 1232) in 16 environmental media from 1174
              studies in the United States, Canada, Europe, and Asia, and in
              vivo toxicity data from 934 studies in 20 species, as well as in
              vitro biological activity data from the US Environmental
              Protection Agency's Toxicity Forecaster and other sources; and 2)
              conduct a comprehensive environmental risk analysis. The results
              show that the mean chemical activities of DEHP and MEHP in abiotic
              environmental samples from locations around the globe are 0.001
              and 10-8 , respectively. This indicates that DEHP has reached on
              average 0.1\% of saturation in the abiotic environment. The mean
              chemical activity of DEHP in biological samples is on average
              100-fold lower than that in abiotic samples, likely because of
              biotransformation of DEHP in biota. Biological responses in both
              in vivo and in vitro tests occur at chemical activities between
              0.01 to 1 for DEHP and between approximately 10-6 and 10-2 for
              MEHP, suggesting a greater potency of MEHP compared with DEHP.
              Chemical activities of both DEHP and MEHP in biota samples were
              less than those causing biological responses in the in vitro
              bioassays, without exception. A small fraction of chemical
              activities of DEHP in abiotic environmental samples (i.e., 4-8\%)

              deposit-feeding and suspension-feeding sea cucumbers
              (Echinodermata, Holothuroidea) not only ingest small (0.25

              plastic fragments than predicted given the ratio of plastic to
              sand grains in the sediment. During four-hour feeding trials,
              holothurians ingested between 2- and 20-fold more plastic per
              individual than expected for PVC fragments, and between 2- and
              138-fold more for nylon line. In addition, two species ingested 4
              mm diameter PVC pellets. The ecological relevance of plastic
              ingestion was assessed in the laboratory by counting and
              characterizing small plastic particles discovered in sediment
              samples from the same field sites where our holothurians were
              collected. Substantial numbers of plastic fragments (105 to 214
              fragments per liter of sediment) were found in samples from three
              different locations along the east coast of the U.S.A. In

              benthic organisms, including both primary and secondary consumers,
              has received little attention. Given that plastics readily adsorb

              could characterize the physical and chemical microenvironment
              experienced by the symbionts and, for the first time, estimate
              effective quantum yields of PSII photochemistry and rates of
              electron transport at the position of the zooxanthellae corrected
              for the in-tissue gradient of scalar irradiance. The oral- and
              aboral Symbiodinium layers received ∼71\% and ∼33\% of surface
              scalar irradiance, respectively, and the two symbiont layers
              experience considerable differences in light exposure. Rates of

              not experience photosynthetic saturation, even at the highest

              saturated. We thus found a different light acclimation response
              for the oral and aboral symbiont bands in hospite, and discuss
              whether such response could be shaped by spectral shifts caused by
              tissue gradients of scalar irradiance. Based on our experimental
              finding, combined with previous knowledge, we present a conceptual

              indicating that E. marina has lower photosynthetic performance

              inverse relationship with latitude, with the highest transcript
              abundances in the southern, warm-acclimatized population and lower
              levels at more northern sites. Up-regulation of the HSR was also
              characterized for each population via acute temperature exposures
              across a thermal gradient. In response to these acute thermal
              challenges, constitutive hsc71 transcripts did not significantly
              up-regulate, while inducible hsp70 transcripts did increase. The
              temperature of initial hsp70 induction (Ton) varied with latitude,
              up-regulating at 17 °C at the northern-most site, 22.5 °C in
              central populations, and 25.5 °C for the southern population.
              However the temperature and abundance of maximal transcription
              (Tmax) did not vary between sites. Results demonstrate latitudinal
              acclimatization in M. galloprovincialis, reveal the capacity of
              the HSR to exhibit different acclimatization patterns, and support
              the suggestion that elevated levels of hsp70 and hsc71 heat shock
              proteins may provide a buffer to low level acute thermal stresses.",

               screening of phthalates should be possible. In this study,
               polymer samples were directly introduced into the pyrolyzer in
               order to thermally extract phthalates from the polymer under
               specific heating conditions. By optimizing the Py-GC/MS
               parameters, a sequential testing cycle of 35 min per sample was
               feasible without causing any major decomposition of the base
               materials. Thus, a rapid screening of over 20 samples per day was
               achieved without any time constraints by effectively utilizing
               specifically prepared reference polymer sheets for quality
               control. Py-GC/MS was found to be suitable and effective for
               identifying phthalates in polymer materials.",

              damaging fish caught on fishing gear) adversely impacts demersal
              longline fisheries for sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria), Pacific
              halibut (Hippoglossus stenolepis) and Greenland turbot
              (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides) in the Bering Sea, Aleutian Islands
              and Western Gulf of Alaska. These interactions increase direct
              costs and opportunity costs associated with catching fish and
              reduce the profitability of longline fishing in western Alaska.
              This study synthesizes National Marine Fisheries Service observer
              data, National Marine Fisheries Service sablefish longline survey
              and fishermen-collected depredation data to: 1) estimate the
              frequency of killer whale depredation on longline fisheries in
              Alaska; 2) estimate depredation-related catch per unit effort
              reductions; and 3) assess direct costs and opportunity costs
              incurred by longliners in western Alaska as a result of killer
              whale interactions. The percentage of commercial fishery sets
              affected by killer whales was highest in the Bering Sea fisheries
              for: sablefish (21.4\%), Greenland turbot (9.9\%), and Pacific
              halibut (6.9\%). Average catch per unit effort reductions on
              depredated sets ranged from 35.1-69.3\% for the observed longline
              fleet in all three management areas from 1998-2012 (p<0.001). To
              compensate for depredation, fishermen set additional gear to catch
              the same amount of fish, and this increased fuel costs by an
              additional 82\% per depredated set (average $433 additional fuel
              per depredated set). In a separate analysis with six longline
              vessels in 2011 and 2012, killer whale depredation avoidance
              measures resulted in an average additional cost of $494 per
              depredated vessel-day for fuel and crew food. Opportunity costs of
              time lost by fishermen averaged \$522 per additional vessel-day on
              the grounds. This assessment of killer whale depredation costs
              represents the most extensive economic evaluation of this issue in
              Alaska to date and will help longline fishermen and managers
              consider the costs and benefits of depredation avoidance and
              alternative policy solutions.",

               source of treasures to be fished, harvested, mined, and salvaged.
               Now accelerating developments in ocean studies offer a new
               understanding of the oceans, their role in a global ecosystem,
               and their vulnerability to threats from human action. Drawing on

               complex reaches of our ocean world and points the way toward

              account as well as different scales, national borders and the
              interface of land and sea. MSP already integrates different views

              improvement in integrating economic, social and cultural
              perspectives. Tools to analyse the economic effects of planning
              decisions are, admittedly, rare. To close this gap, the Spatial
              Economic Benefit Analysis (SEBA) tool has been developed. The
              method identifies and maps the spatial distribution of benefits
              associated with certain maritime uses. Given that statistical data
              on maritime sectors is not available at the necessary level of
              detail, the SEBA tool takes a rather unconventional approach.
              Instead of directly assessing monetary benefits, it identifies
              beneficiaries and analyses their geographical distribution. In
              this way, the tool enables MSP practitioners to respond to current
              and future integration challenges. For the sectors of shipping and
              offshore wind energy, the tool has been tested on the case of the
              German Baltic Sea region. The case study reveals strengths and

              industry, and the emergence of other novel marine uses such as
              wave and tidal generators, have upped the ante for spatial
              planners, as well as consenting and approval authorities in
              various coastal states. These stakeholders rely on processes such
              as navigational risk assessments (NRAs) to balance safety and
              efficiency requirements and to make optimal decisions over use of
              space. Given the increasingly complex and crowded seascape,
              however, there are some apprehensions about potential shortcomings
              in these NRA processes. There is also some concern that these
              inadequacies may lead to unsafe or inefficient marine spatial use.
              To understand how NRA processes can be improved further, a
              literature review is conducted, followed by a survey of
              respondents who are involved in the planning, consenting and/or
              approval of offshore wind farms across seven different countries.
              A summary of the NRA processes in these seven countries is
              presented, and several shortcomings are identified. Based on the
              findings of the survey, a list of recommendations is presented to
              enhance existing NRA processes—and to improve the coexistence of
              shipping and offshore wind farms (OWFs).",

              approaches. Using powerful technology, however, is not the same as
              having the necessary power to address a research question with
              statistical robustness. In the rush to adopt new and improved
              genomic research methods, limitations of technology and
              experimental design may be initially neglected. Here, we review
              these issues with regard to RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). RNA-seq adds
              large-scale transcriptomics to the toolkit of ecological and
              evolutionary biologists, enabling differential gene expression
              (DE) studies in nonmodel species without the need for prior
              genomic resources. High biological variance is typical of
              field-based gene expression studies and means that larger sample
              sizes are often needed to achieve the same degree of statistical
              power as clinical studies based on data from cell lines or inbred
              animal models. Sequencing costs have plummeted, yet RNA-seq
              studies still underutilize biological replication. Finite research
              budgets force a trade-off between sequencing effort and
              replication in RNA-seq experimental design. However, clear
              guidelines for negotiating this trade-off, while taking into
              account study-specific factors affecting power, are currently
              lacking. Study designs that prioritize sequencing depth over
              replication fail to capitalize on the power of RNA-seq technology
              for DE inference. Significant recent research effort has gone into
              developing statistical frameworks and software tools for power
              analysis and sample size calculation in the context of RNA-seq DE
              analysis. We synthesize progress in this area and derive an
              accessible rule-of-thumb guide for designing powerful RNA-seq

              Declines in kelp abundance can lead to cascading losses of
              biodiversity and productivity with far-reaching ecological and
              socioeconomic consequences. The Salish Sea is a hotspot of kelp
              diversity where many species of kelp provide critical habitat and
              food for commercially, ecologically, and culturally important fish
              and invertebrate species. However, like other regions, kelp
              forests in much of the Salish Sea are in rapid decline. Data gaps
              and limited long-term monitoring have hampered attempts to
              identify and manage for specific drivers of decline, despite the
              documented urgency to protect these important habitats. To address
              these knowledge gaps, we gathered a focus group of experts on kelp
              in the Salish Sea to identify perceived direct and indirect
              stressors facing kelp forests. We then conducted a comprehensive
              literature review of peer-reviewed studies from the Salish Sea and
              temperate coastal ecosystems worldwide to assess the level of
              support for the pathways identified by the experts, and we

              highlighted the potential to use expert knowledge for making

              relationships. Finally, we prioritized areas for future research
              in the Salish Sea. This study demonstrates the value expert
              opinion has to inform management decisions. These methods are
              readily adaptable to other ecosystem management contexts, and the

              Although widespread throughout Alaska, the highest numbers of such

              the resident ecotype feeding on catch or discarded catch and
              fishermen using whale deterrence measures represented 96\% (number

              study (n=3245). We found that 87\% (n=2817) of all interactions
              occurred during longline operations. Both minor and serious
              injuries were documented. Twenty-­ seven killer whales were

              observers and from satellite-linked transmitters deployed on false
              killer whales to identify patterns of odontocete depredation that
              could help fishermen avoid overlap with whales. Odontocete
              depredation was observed on ˜6\% of deep-set hauls across the
              fleet from 2004 to 2018. Model outcomes from binomial GAMMs
              suggested coarse patterns, for example, higher rates of
              depredation in winter, at lower latitudes, and with higher fishing
              effort. However, explanatory power was low, and no covariates were
              identified that could be used in a predictive context. The best
              indicator of depredation was the occurrence of depredation on a
              previous set of the same vessel. We identified spatiotemporal
              scales of this repeat depredation to provide guidance to fishermen
              on how far to move or how long to wait to reduce the probability
              of repeated interactions. The risk of depredation decreased with
              both space and time from a previous occurrence, with the greatest
              benefits achieved by moving ˜400 km or waiting ˜9 d, which reduced
              the occurrence of depredation from 18\% to 9\% (a 50\% reduction).
              Fishermen moved a median 46 km and waited 4.7 h following an
              observed depredation interaction, which our analysis suggests is
              unlikely to lead to large reductions in risk. Satellite-tagged
              pelagic false killer whales moved up to 75 km in 4 h and 335 km in
              24 h, suggesting that they can likely keep pace with longline
              vessels for at least four hours and likely longer. We recommend
              fishermen avoid areas of known depredation or bycatch by moving as
              far and as quickly as practical, especially within a day or two of
              the depredation or bycatch event. We also encourage captains to
              communicate depredation and bycatch occurrence to enable other

              interactions between vessels and killer whales was decreased by
              (i) the number of vessels operating simultaneously in the area:
              the limited number of depredating killer whales may induce a
              dilution effect with increased fleet size, and (ii) depth of
              longline sets: vessels operating in shallow waters may be more
              accessible to whales that are initially distributed on
              peri-insular shelves. The cpue was negatively influenced by (iii)
              length of longlines: longer sets may provide killer whales access
              to a greater proportion of hooked fish per set, and positively
              influenced by (iv) hauling speed: increased speed may shorten the
              time during which toothfish are accessible to whales during
              hauling. The time it takes for killer whales to reach vessels was

              whales seem to temporarily lose track of vessels. These findings

              given these variables to reduce killer whale depredation here and
              in similar situations elsewhere. To a greater extent, this study

              whales were observed on 16\% of longline survey sampling days,
              mostly (95\% of sightings) over the continental slope. Sightings
              were most common in the central and eastern Gulf of Alaska (98\%
              of sightings), occasional in the western Gulf of Alaska and
              Aleutian Islands, and absent in the Bering Sea. Longline survey
              catches were commonly preyed upon when sperm whales were present
              (65\% of sightings), as evidenced by damaged fish. Neither sperm
              whale presence (P= 0.71) nor depredation rate (P= 0.78) increased
              significantly from 1998 to 2004. Longline survey catch rates were
              about 2\% less at locations where depredation was observed, but
              the effect was not significant (P= 0.34). Estimated sperm whale
              depredation was <1\% of the annual sablefish longline fishery

              depredated during 2.0\% of vessel days in the western Bering Sea

              exclusively Greenland turbot (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides).
              Seventy-one killer whales were identified depredating on longlines

              the most impacted by odontocete (toothed whales) depredation.
              While technological means have provided limited efficacy in
              reducing depredation, this study examined the fishing practices
              influencing both the proportion of depredated longline sets and
              the amount of fish removed by whales. We used an 8-year dataset
              from the Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides) longline
              fisheries operating in Crozet and Kerguelen Economic Exclusive
              Zones (EEZs) (South Indian Ocean) and GLMMs to investigate sperm
              whale (Physeter macrocephalus) depredation. Sperm whale
              depredation occurred on 61\% of 5260 sets in Crozet and 41\% of
              16,902 sets in Kerguelen, and resulted in minimum estimated
              toothfish losses of 702 tons and 2649 tons, respectively, in the
              two areas. The probability of depredation decreased in winter
              months, increased with depth fished and decreased when vessels
              travelled over distances of >60 km from fishing grounds with
              encountering depredation. These findings suggest the natural
              spatio-temporal distribution of sperm whales and their ability to
              follow vessels over limited ranges influence the number of
              captured fish removals. The amount of depredated toothfish
              decreased with the speed at which longline sets were hauled and
              increased with the soaking time of sets suggesting that whales may
              depredate sets during both hauling and soaking operations.
              Together, these observations indicate that rates of depredation
              may be influenced by the conditions of fishing operations and
              could therefore be employed to implement strategies of avoidance
              in all fisheries facing similar depredation impacts.",

              Depredation can reduce sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria) catch rates
              and increase uncertainty in survey-derived estimates of sablefish
              biomass. Using 27 years of longline survey data, this study: 1)
              evaluates fixed- and mixed-effects generalized linear models to
              estimate the effects of sperm whale depredation on the sablefish
              survey abundance; and 2) evaluates the impact of accounting for
              sperm whale depredation in the sablefish stock assessment. Model
              evaluation and simulations showed that mixed-effect models were
              far superior to fixed-effect models in terms of precision and
              confidence interval coverage. The estimated reduction in sablefish
              catch rate due to depredation was approximately 15\%, which was
              considerably higher than previous estimates. Correcting for sperm
              whale depredation in the assessment resulted in a 2\% increase in

              environments, one of the primary gear types implicated in these
              interactions is the pelagic longline. Unlike accidental
              entanglement in driftnets or deliberate entrapment by
              purse-seines, interactions between cetaceans and longlines are
              often driven by attraction of the animals to feed on bait or fish
              secured on the gear, a behavior known as depredation. Many small
              and medium-sized delphinid species have learned to exploit such
              opportunities, leading to economic costs to fisheries and a risk
              of mortality to the animals from either retaliation by fishermen
              or hooking or entanglement in fishing gear. Two pelagic longline
              fisheries in the United States experience depredation and bycatch
              by odontocete depredators: the Hawai‘i deep-set longline fishery,
              which is depredated primarily by false killer whales (Pseudorca
              crassidens), and the Atlantic pelagic longline fishery depredated
              primarily by short-finned pilot whales (Globicephala
              macrorhynchus). These fisheries are among the most intensively
              documented and managed pelagic longline fisheries in the world,
              with high levels of observer coverage, and bycatch mitigation
              measures required to reduce the mortality of seabirds, sea turtles
              and cetaceans. Both fisheries have active, multi-stakeholder “Take
              Reduction Teams,” enacted under the U.S. Marine Mammal Protection
              Act (MMPA), that are tasked to develop measures to reduce the
              bycatch of cetaceans below statutory reference points.
              Consequently, these two Teams represent model processes within
              which to address depredation and bycatch, having access to
              detailed, high-quality data on the nature and frequency of
              interactions with cetaceans, meaningful stakeholder involvement,
              resources to test potential solutions, and the institutional will
              to improve outcomes. We review how mitigation strategies have been
              considered, developed, and implemented by both Teams and provide a
              critical analysis of their effectiveness in addressing these

              Commercial longliners, fishing for their own sablefish quotas

              federal sablefish longline survey that contributes to estimation

              acoustic decoy in reducing encounters between sperm whales and
              longline fishing gear. The aim of the acoustic decoy was to use
              fishing vessel sounds to attract whales to an area away from the
              true fishing haul in order to reduce interactions between
              commercial fishing vessels and whales. A custom playback device
              that could be remotely activated via a radio modem was
              incorporated into an anchored buoy system that could be deployed
              by the vessel during a two-month trip between June and July 2013.
              Once activated, the decoy broadcasted vessel-hauling noises known

              decoy was deployed, yielding fourteen sets with whales present

              found between the number of whales present at the true fishing
              haul and the distance of the haul from the decoy (1–14km range),
              with the decoy being most effective at ranges greater than 9km
              (t=−2.06, df=12, p=0.04). The results suggest that acoustic decoys

              evolution: (a) a diversification producing the four ‘derived’
              families Alariaceae, Costariceae, Laminariaceae, and Lessoniaceae
              and most extant genera in the temperate northern Pacific, probably
              during the Miocene. (b) The evolution of an Arctic flora which
              invaded the North Atlantic following the opening of the Bering
              Strait ca. 5.5Ma. (c) At least four separate crossings, by
              different genera, of tropical regions from Northern to Southern
              Hemisphere (and one in the opposite direction). The recorded
              impacts of man on these distributions have thus far been minimal,
              with the notable exceptions of Undaria pinnatifida and species of
              Saccharina (grown in aquaculture systems for human food). Most
              genera are monospecific, with many confined to either the western
              or eastern temperate North Pacific, whereas the distribution of
              the most species-rich genera (Alaria, Laminaria, Saccharina)
              includes the Arctic, and they are widespread in the North
              Atlantic. This rapid species-level evolution is hypothesised to
              have been promoted by the relatively recent invasion of the
              Atlantic by these taxa. The crossing of the tropics has occurred
              in warm-temperate species some of which occur and are sometimes
              abundant, in deeper water in today’s tropics, refuting the
              widespread view that kelps are only present in cold-water
              habitats. Most of these Southern Hemisphere kelps are in the
              family Lessoniaceae, including the only genus not present in the
              Northern Hemisphere, Lessonia. The origins of this genus are
              unclear. Knowledge of the phylogeography of the Ecklonia/Eisenia
              complex is particularly important in understanding Southern
              Hemisphere kelp biogeography. A number of groups are undergoing
              active speciation and, with the lack of a consistent species
              concept, the species-level taxonomy of the group remains to be
              clarified. There is a great need for molecular phylogeographical
              studies to provide evidence for many of the hypotheses presented
              here based on distributional evidence and the currently accepted
              taxonomic framework. KeywordsKelps-Global

              In temperate marine ecosystems, kelps (Laminariales) drive
              productivity and form essential habitat but an incomplete
              understanding of their phylogeny has limited our ability to infer
              their evolutionary origins and the spatial and temporal patterns
              of their diversification. Here, we reconstruct the diversification
              of habitat-forming kelps using a global genus-level phylogeny
              inferred primarily from organellar genome datasets, and
              investigate the timing of kelp radiation. We resolve several
              important phylogenetic features, including relationships among the
              morphologically simple kelp families and the broader radiation of
              complex kelps, demonstrating that the initial radiation of the
              latter resulted from an increase in speciation rate around the
              Eocene-Oligocene boundary. This burst in speciation rate is
              consistent with a possible role of recent climatic cooling in
              triggering the kelp radiation and pre-dates the origin of
              benthic-foraging carnivores. Historical biogeographical
              reconstructions point to a northeast Pacific origin of complex
              kelps, with subsequent colonization of new habitats likely playing
              an important role in driving their ecological diversification. We
              infer that complex morphologies associated with modern kelp
              forests (e.g. branching, pneumatocysts) evolved several times over
              the past 15–20 MY, highlighting the importance of morphological
              convergence in establishing modern upright kelp forests. Our
              phylogenomic findings provide new insights into the geographical
              and ecological proliferation of kelps and provide a timeline along
              which feedbacks between kelps and their food-webs could have

              cm) were compared after 56 days under fully controlled conditions
              of waves or no waves, and high or low nutrient availability (i.e.,
              LN-NW, LN-W, HN-NW, and HN-W treatments). Waves primarily
              increased frond biomass, elongation rate, and carbon to nitrogen
              ratio (C:N ratio) and induced both a greater variety in and
              rougher frond surface shapes. The fastest, second-fastest, and

              the thready and spring-like shapes found in the central frond
              (i.e., rougher frond surface) in wave-exposed conditions can at
              least partly compensate for low nutrient availability by enhancing
              nutrient and photon acquisition, particularly in low nutrient

              surface shapes and highest C:N ratios compared with distal and

              regarded both as possessing high morphological and physiological

  abstract = "Tire wear particle (TWP) contamination is of growing concern as
              recent studies show the ubiquity and toxicity of this contaminant
              in various environmental compartments. The multidimensional aspect
              of TWPs makes it difficult to assess toxicity and predict impacts
              on ecosystems, as it combines a complex mixture of chemicals and
              can release micro- and nanoparticles when suspended in water. Our
              work aimed to shed light on the toxicity of the different
              components of TWP leachate, namely, the dissolved chemicals and
              the nanoparticle fractions, on three freshwater model species of
              different trophic levels: Chlorella vulgaris, Lemna minor, and
              Daphnia magna. Acute toxicity was observed for all three fractions
              in D. magna, and an additive effect was observed between the
              nanoparticles and dissolved chemicals. L. minor experienced
              phytotoxicity from the dissolved chemicals only with a decrease up
              to 50\% in photosynthesis efficiency parameters. C. vulgaris
              showed minor signs of toxicity on apical endpoints in response to
              each of the fractions. Our study highlights that nanoparticles
              from TWP leachate that were mostly overlooked in several previous
              studies are as toxic as dissolved chemicals for the filter-feeder
              species D. magna, and we also show the toxicity to photosynthesis
              in aquatic plants.",

              the environment and their toxicity in aquatic animals is still a
              matter of intense debate. In this review on PAEs in aquatic
              environments (lakes, rivers and seas), it is found that there is a
              large variety and abundance of PAEs in developing countries, and
              the total concentration of PAEs even exceeds 200 μg / L. The

              induced by various PAEs is summarized for the first time in the
              article. Exposure of PAEs can lead to activation of the
              detoxification system CYP450 and endocrine system receptors of
              aquatic animals, which in turn causes oxidative stress, metabolic
              disorders, endocrine disorders, and immunosuppression. Meanwhile,

              directions. Phthalate monoesters (MPEs), the metabolites of PAEs,
              are also toxic to aquatic animals, however, the toxicity is weaker

              challenged traditional concepts in toxicology, in particular the
              dogma of ``the dose makes the poison,'' because EDCs can have
              effects at low doses that are not predicted by effects at higher
              doses. Here, we review two major concepts in EDC studies: low dose
              and nonmonotonicity. Low-dose effects were defined by the National
              Toxicology Program as those that occur in the range of human
              exposures or effects observed at doses below those used for
              traditional toxicological studies. We review the mechanistic data
              for low-dose effects and use a weight-of-evidence approach to
              analyze five examples from the EDC literature. Additionally, we
              explore nonmonotonic dose-response curves, defined as a nonlinear
              relationship between dose and effect where the slope of the curve
              changes sign somewhere within the range of doses examined. We
              provide a detailed discussion of the mechanisms responsible for
              generating these phenomena, plus hundreds of examples from the
              cell culture, animal, and epidemiology literature. We illustrate
              that nonmonotonic responses and low-dose effects are remarkably
              common in studies of natural hormones and EDCs. Whether low doses
              of EDCs influence certain human disorders is no longer conjecture,
              because epidemiological studies show that environmental exposures
              to EDCs are associated with human diseases and disabilities. We
              conclude that when nonmonotonic dose-response curves occur, the
              effects of low doses cannot be predicted by the effects observed
              at high doses. Thus, fundamental changes in chemical testing and

              contaminants in extremely high concentrations. When released from
              the particle, these contaminants have the potential to cause toxic
              effects in the biota. So far, reports of toxic effects are mostly
              linked with the direct exposure of organisms through ingestion of
              contaminated microplastics. There is little information on the
              toxicity of leachates from microplastics to marine organisms. In
              this study, we conducted experiments to evaluate the toxicity of
              leachates from virgin and beached plastic pellets to embryo
              development of the brown mussel (Perna perna). We compared the
              efficiency of two test procedures, and evaluated the toxicity of

              beached pellets, while the toxicity of leachate from virgin
              pellets was mainly due to plastic additives. Our results suggest

              First, even though the majority of environmental microplastics are
              plastic microﬁbers from textiles, laboratory studies still largely
              use spherical microbeads. There are also inconsistencies between
              the measurements of microplastics in the environment as compared
              to the concentrations that tend to be used in experimental
              studies. Likewise, the period of exposure occurring in
              experimental studies and in the environment are vastly different.
              Lastly, although experimental studies often focus on a particular
              subset of toxic chemicals present on microplastics, textile
              microﬁbers carry other dyes and chemicals that are understudied.
              They also cause types of physical damage not associated with
              microspheres. This review will analyze the literature pertaining

              confirming the ubiquity of MP contamination in marine ecosystems.
              This systematic review aimed at summarizing the results of the
              vast literature concerning the bioaccumulation of MPs in marine
              organisms to 1) shed light on potential differences in MP body

              These results confirmed that all marine organisms can ingest and

              leaves as used for the photon-yield measurements. Considerable
              variation in fluorescence emission both at 692 nm and at 734 nm,
              was found 1) among the different species; 2) between the upper and
              lower surfaces of the same leaves; and 3) between sun and shade
              leaves of the same species. By contrast, the ratio of variable to
              maximum fluorescence emission at 692 nm (FV/FM, 692) remained
              remarkably constant (The mean value for the C3 species was
              0.832±0.004). High-light treatments of shade leaves resulted in a
              reduction in both ϕa and the FV/FM, 692 ratio. The extent of the
              reductions increased with time of exposure to bright light. A
              linear relationship was obtained when ϕa was plotted against
              FV/FM, 692. The results show that determinations of the photon
              yield of O2 evolution and the FV/FM, 692 ratio can serve as
              excellent quantitative measures of photoinhibition of overall

              Symbiodinium (zooxanthellae, ZX) and a chlorophyte (zoochlorellae,

              over the other and whether temperature regulates the observed
              distributions of natural populations of ZX and ZC. Temperature
              appears to be a key factor in regulating both the photophysiology
              and metabolism of this algal–cnidarian association. In anemones
              containing ZX, neither algal densities nor chlorophyll content
              varied with temperature (6–24 °C); in contrast, anemones with ZC
              displayed reduced densities and chlorophyll content at the highest

              were directly related to temperature, as were anemone respiration

              algal density and chlorophyll content, and higher potential
              contribution of algal carbon toward animal respiration (CZAR)
              suggest that the ZX are the more viable symbiont as temperature
              increases, but we suggest alternative reasons why ZC are preserved
              in this symbiotic association. Elevated temperatures reduce ZC
              densities and chlorophyll, suggesting that higher temperatures
              affect this relationship in a negative fashion, presumably due to
              a higher cost of maintaining ZC by the association; alternatively,
              these costs may be affiliated with the deterioration of the ZC
              themselves. These results suggest that temperature may be one of
              the most significant environmental parameters that sets the

              fatness), and cub production. Satellite telemetry data from 43
              (1991–1997) and 38 (2009–2015) adult female polar bears in the
              Baffin Bay subpopulation showed that bears now spend an additional
              30 d on land (90 d in total) in the 2000s compared to the 1990s, a
              change closely correlated with changes in spring sea ice breakup
              and fall sea ice formation. Body condition declined for all sex,
              age, and reproductive classes and was positively correlated with
              sea ice availability in the current and previous year.
              Furthermore, cub litter size was positively correlated with
              maternal condition and spring breakup date (i.e., later breakup
              leading to larger litters), and negatively correlated with the
              duration of the ice-free period (i.e., longer ice-free periods
              leading to smaller litters). Based on these relationships, we
              projected reproductive performance three polar bear generations
              into the future (approximately 35 yr). Results indicate that
              two-cub litters, previously the norm, could largely disappear from
              Baffin Bay as sea ice loss continues. Our findings demonstrate how
              concurrent analysis of multiple data types collected over long
              periods from polar bears can provide a mechanistic understanding
              of the ecological implications of climate change. This information
              is needed for long-term conservation planning, which includes
              quantitative harvest risk assessments that incorporate estimated
              or assumed trends in future environmental carrying capacity.",

              Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) collected from subsistence
              hunters can provide important insights and improve management
              decisions when collected systematically. We report on the results
              of a TEK survey of subsistence polar bear hunters living in the
              areas around Tasiilaq and Ittoqqortoormiit, East Greenland.
              Twenty-ﬁve full-time polar bear hunters were interviewed between
              December 2014 and March 2015 in a conversation-style interview,
              where a local interviewer ﬂuent in the East Greenlandic dialect
              asked a series of 55 predetermined questions. The primary goals
              were to (1) gather Inuit perspectives on polar bear subsistence
              quotas and hunting strategies, (2) understand how climate change
              is affecting the polar bear subsistence hunt, and (3) document
              observed changes in polar bear distribution, abundance, and
              biology. Approximately 40\% of the Tasiilaq respondents had caught
              between 10 and 19 polar bears in their lifetime, while 67\% of
              Ittoqqortoormiit respondents reported lifetime catches of ≥20
              bears. In both areas, polar bears were most commonly hunted
              between February and April. Hunters noted large changes to the
              climate in the areas where they hunt polar bears. Most hunters
              reported loss of sea ice, receding glaciers, unstable weather, and
              warmer temperatures. In Tasiilaq 73\% of the hunters said climate
              changes had affected the polar bear hunt and in Ittoqqortoormiit
              about 88\% of respondents reported the same. Hunters indicated
              that sea ice loss has created more areas of open water so dog
              sledges have become unsafe for hunting transportation compared to
              10–15 years ago (reported by 100\% of hunters in Tasiilaq and 80\%
              in Ittoqqortoormiit). In Ittoqqortoormiit, the distance traveled
              during polar bear hunting trips has decreased dramatically. In
              both areas hunters noted that more polar bears are coming into
              their communities compared to 10–15 years ago (81\% of Tasiilaq
              hunters and 78\% of Ittoqqortoormiit hunters) and pointed to the
              introduction of quotas and loss of sea ice as potential reasons.
              This study provides an important perspective on the East Greenland
              subpopulation of polar bears that can be used to direct science
              questions and inform management.",

              covering roughly 20\% of the Channel Islands National Marine
              Sanctuary was established in 2003, with a goal of providing
              regional conservation and ﬁshery beneﬁts. We used a spatially
              explicit bioeconomic simulation model and a Bayesian
              difference-in-difference regression to examine the conditions
              under which MPAs can provide population-level conservation beneﬁts
              inside and outside their borders and to assess evidence of those
              beneﬁts in the Channel Islands. As of 2017, we estimated that
              biomass densities of targeted ﬁn-ﬁsh had a median value 81\%
              higher (90\% credible interval: 23–148) inside the Channel Island

              on mean total biomass densities at the population level: estimated
              median effect was –7\% (90\% credible interval: –31 to 23) from
              2015 to 2017. Our simulation model showed that effect sizes of

              expectations and uncertainties around MPAs is critical to ensuring
              that MPAs are effective. We provide a novel assessment of the
              population-level effects of a large MPA network across many
              different species of targeted ﬁn-ﬁsh, and our results offer

              Epidemiological techniques integrating data from oceanography,
              diagnostics and pathogen shedding rates and viability contribute
              to improved understanding of pathogen transmission pathways among

              the likelihood of exposure, infection and disease among
              susceptible fish. Disease mitigation in mariculture occurs at 2
              scales: area-based (coordinated stocking, harvesting and
              fallowing) and farm-based (vaccination, early pathogen detection,

              transmission is less likely to be effective in some areas due to

              dissemination of larval lice when parasites occur below management
              thresholds. For wild populations, risk of pathogen spillback is

              impacts of plastics are widely reported, particularly on marine
              vertebrates, impacts on microbial life remain poorly understood.
              Plastics impact microbiomes directly, exerting toxic effects,
              providing supplemental carbon sources and acting as rafts for
              microbial colonisation and dispersal. Indirect consequences
              include increased environmental shading, altered compositions of
              host communities and disruption of host organism or community
              health, hormone balances and immune responses. The isolation and
              application of plastic-degrading microbes are of substantial
              interest yet little evidence supports the microbial biodegradation
              of most high molecular weight synthetic polymers. Over 400
              microbial species have been presumptively identified as capable of
              plastic degradation, but evidence for the degradation of highly
              prevalent polymers including polypropylene, nylon, polystyrene and
              polyvinyl chloride must be treated with caution; most studies fail
              to differentiate losses caused by the leaching or degradation of
              polymer monomers, additives or fillers. Even where polymer
              degradation is demonstrated, such as for polyethylene
              terephthalate, the ability of microorganisms to degrade more
              highly crystalline forms of the polymer used in commercial
              plastics appears limited. Microbiomes frequently work in
              conjunction with abiotic factors such as heat and light to impact
              the structural integrity of polymers and accessibility to
              enzymatic attack. Consequently, there remains much scope for
              extremophile microbiomes to be explored as a source of
              plastic-degrading enzymes and microorganisms. We propose a
              best-practice workflow for isolating and reporting
              plastic-degrading taxa from diverse environmental microbiomes,
              which should include multiple lines of evidence supporting changes
              in polymer structure, mass loss, and detection of presumed
              degradation products, along with confirmation of microbial strains
              and enzymes (and their associated genes) responsible for high

              primary driver of such trait change, has received much attention
              in the literature and is now commonly considered in fisheries
              management. The potential for selection on behavioural traits has
              received less study, but mounting evidence suggests that
              aggression, foraging behaviour and linked traits can also be
              affected by fishing. An important phenomenon that has received
              much less attention is selection on reproductive phenology (i.e.,
              the timing of breeding). The potential for this type of “temporal
              selection” is widespread because there is often substantial
              variability in reproductive phenology within fish populations, and
              fisheries management strategies or fishermen’s behaviours can
              cause fishing effort to vary greatly over time. For example,
              seasonal closures may expose only early or late breeding
              individuals to harvest as observed in a range of marine and
              freshwater fisheries. Such selection may induce evolutionary
              responses in phenological traits, but can also have demographic
              impacts such as shortened breeding seasons and reduced phenotypic
              diversity. These changes can in turn influence productivity,
              reduce the efficacy of management, exacerbate ongoing
              climate-­driven changes in phenology and reduce resilience to
              environmental change. In this essay, we describe how fisheries
              management can cause temporal variability in harvest, and describe
              the types of selection on temporal traits that can result. We then
              summarize the likely biological consequences of temporally
              selective fishing on populations and population complexes and

              microplastics in nature, while others have tested the impacts of
              these small plastics on organismal health in the laboratory. Yet,

              First, even though the majority of environmental microplastics are
              plastic microﬁbers from textiles, laboratory studies still largely
              use spherical microbeads. There are also inconsistencies between
              the measurements of microplastics in the environment as compared
              to the concentrations that tend to be used in experimental
              studies. Likewise, the period of exposure occurring in
              experimental studies and in the environment are vastly different.
              Lastly, although experimental studies often focus on a particular
              subset of toxic chemicals present on microplastics, textile
              microﬁbers carry other dyes and chemicals that are understudied.
              They also cause types of physical damage not associated with
              microspheres. This review will analyze the literature pertaining
              to these mismatches, focusing on aquatic organisms and model

              assessment (LCA) studies have been conducted on several seafood

              the aquaculture sector? To address these questions, we performed a
              critical review of 65 LCA studies of aquaculture systems from the
              open literature. We conducted quantitative analyses to explore
              which impacts can be identiﬁed as dominating and to compare

              Some reef-building corals respond to thermal stress and subsequent
              bleaching with increases in heterotrophy, which may increase the
              risk of ingesting microplastics. Whether this heterotrophic
              plasticity affects microplastics ingestion or whether ingesting
              microplastics affects heterotrophic feeding in corals is unknown.
              To determine this, two coral species, Montipora capitata and
              Pocillopora damicornis , were exposed to ambient (~27 °C) and
              increased (~30 °C) temperature and then fed microplastics, Artemia
              nauplii, or both. Following thermal stress, both species
              significantly reduced feeding on Artemia but no significant
              decrease in microplastics ingestion was observed. Interestingly, P
              . damicornis only ingested microplastics when Artemia were also

              observed diﬀerences in species susceptibility to the disease are

              °C) pink abalone (H. corrugata), to experimental WS infection at
              temperatures facilitating disease proliferation. Mortality data
              paired with histological and molecular detection of the WS
              pathogen conﬁrmed that these abalone species exhibit diﬀerent
              levels of susceptibility to infection and resistance to WS
              development ranging from high susceptibility and low resistance in
              pinto abalone to moderate/low susceptibility and resistance in red
              and pink abalones. The temperature associated with WS induced
              mortalities also varied among species: pinto abalone died at the
              lowest experimental temperature (17.32 ± 0.09 °C), while red
              abalone died at an intermediate temperature (17.96 ± 0.16 °C), and
              pink abalone required the highest temperature (18.84 ± 0.16 °C).
              When data from the current and previous studies were examined,
              susceptibility to WS was inversely related to phylogenetic
              distance from white abalone (H. sorenseni), which had the highest
              susceptibility and lowest resistance of all abalone species tested
              prior to the current study. These results provide further evidence
              that an abalone’s thermal optima and phylogenetic relationship can
              determine its susceptibility to WS; species with cool water
              evolutionary histories are most susceptible to WS and the most
              susceptible species appear to be closely related. Diﬀerences among
              the thermal ranges of abalone species have broad implications for
              WS disease dynamics and highlight the importance of understanding
              the mechanisms governing the abalone-WS relationship in order to

              have addressed freshwater algae. This study investigated the

              compared with the control group, the chlorophyll a content of C.
              pyrenoidosa was reduced by 55.23\%. For photosynthetic activity,
              higher concentrations of PVC and PP can induce lower values of

              communities associated with these octocorals were also compared to
              common temperate (Plesiastrea versipora) and tropical (Acropora
              aspera) hard corals from the same reefs. Using 16S rRNA amplicon
              sequencing, bacterial diversity was found to be heterogeneous
              among octocorals, but we observed changes in composition between
              summer and winter for some species (C. gaboensis and Sinularia
              sp.), but not for others (E. hicksoni and Sarcophyton sp.).
              Bacterial community structure differed significantly between all
              octocoral species within both the temperate and tropical
              environments. However, on a seasonal basis, those differences were
              less pronounced. The microbiomes of C. gaboensis and Sinularia sp.
              were dominated by bacteria belonging to the genus Endozoicomonas,
              which were a key conserved feature of their core microbiomes. In
              contrast to previous studies, our analysis revealed that
              Endozoicomonas phylotypes are shared across different octocoral
              species, inhabiting different environments. Together, our data
              demonstrates that octocorals harbour a broad diversity of
              bacterial partners, some of which comprise ‘core microbiomes’ that
              potentially impart important functional roles to their hosts.",

              regarding how changes in water chemistry will impact the

              concentrations in tissue of Mediterranean mussels (Mytilus
              galloprovincialis) and Olympia oysters (Ostrea lurida) in Puget
              Sound, Washington, a region that experiences naturally low pH,
              seasonal hypoxia, and is surrounded by urbanized and

              Inlet, Point Wells, and Dabob Bay) where oceanographic data was

              coupled plasma mass-spectrometry (ICP-MS) to measure trace metals

              bivalves were not associated with high concentrations of metals in
              seawater. Metal concentrations in shellfish were associated with
              size: smaller shellfish had higher concentrations of metals. Carr
              Inlet at 20 m depth had the smallest shellfish and the highest
              metal concentrations. While we could not eliminate possible
              confounding factors, we also found higher metal concentrations in
              shellfish associated with lower pH, lower temperature, and lower
              dissolved oxygen (conditions seen at Carr Inlet at 20 m and to a
              lesser extent at Point Wells at 5 m depth). There were also
              significant differences in accumulation of metals between oysters
              and mussels, most notably copper and zinc, which were found in

              of this data set demonstrated responses related to physiology,
              behavior, growth and development, and increased mortality in the
              larval and adult stages to low pH exposure. Second, statistical

              through discussions and synthesis, the expert panel identified a

              by predictions for high global demands of important commodities,
              which require the development of alternative supplies of natural
              resources. In this study the dynamics of loss of biomass from
              cultivated Saccharina latissima were studied from February to
              August 2018 at two kelp farms in Northern (69°45.26′N/019°02.18′E)
              and in Mid-Norway (63°42.28′N/08°52.23′E). Kelp fronds at each
              farm were individually followed throughout the growing season.
              Sectional regression was applied for conversion of measured frond
              lengths to estimated dry weights. The study shows that between 40
              and 100\% of all individuals in the studied kelp population
              constantly eroded slightly from their distal ends. However, until
              June the accumulated loss was only 8\% of produced dry weight. Due
              to dislodgement of whole sporophytes this picture changed in July
              and August to heavy losses in Mid-Norway. Thus, the overall losses
              of kelp in terms of accumulated dry weight were only 8–13\% of the
              gross growth until harvest in June in Mid-Norway and August in
              Northern Norway. Losses increased significantly in Mid-Norway
              during July and reached 49.4\% of the annual production in August.
              The rates of losses were separated into specific erosion and
              dislodgement rates. Erosion rates over the whole experimental
              period for the two sites were not significantly different, while
              differences in dislodgement rates between farm sites proved to be
              highly significant. The exported annual amount of carbon was
              estimated on the basis of lost and measured carbon content in the
              tissue. From these data a scenario was built for a commercial
              Norwegian kelp farm growing S. latissima showing a carbon export
              of 63–88 g C m –2 y –1 . This is eight times less than has been
              reported from scenarios for kelp farms in China. This study
              confirms that optimal timing of harvest is the most important
              management tool for avoidance of heavy losses from kelp farms. In
              conclusion, an industry with early harvest will likely have a low
              carbon export, while a late-harvested bulk production could export
              four to six times as much carbon with an increased potential for
              carbon sequestration.",

              could suffer from microplastic contamination, leading to larger
              impacts on aquatic food webs. Nonetheless, little is known about
              the toxic effects of microplastics on microalgae populations.
              Thus, the objective of this review was to identify these effects
              and the impacts of microplastics on microalgae populations based
              on currently available literature, also identifying knowledge

              photosystem II and enhancing the cyclic electron transfer around
              photosystem I, both of which limited damage to the photosystem
              from excess light energy and resulted in ATP production,
              supporting cellular growth and other physiological processes.
              Furthermore, the increased cyclic electron transfer rate,

              parameter, the electron requirement for carbon ﬁxation (KC), to
              retrieve rates of CO2-ﬁxation. KC strongly depends upon
              environmental conditions regulating photosynthesis, yet the
              importance of N-availability to this parameter has not been
              examined. Here, we use nutrient bioassays to isolate how N
              (relative to other macronutrients P, Si) regulates KC of
              phytoplankton communities from the Australian coast during summer,
              when N-availability is often highly variable. KC consistently
              responded to N-amendment, exhibiting up to a threefold reduction

              electrons were used to drive C-ﬁxation. However, the process
              driving this consistent reduction was dependent upon initial
              conditions. When diatoms dominated assemblages and N was
              undetectable (e.g., post bloom), KC decreased predominantly via a
              physiological adjustment of the existing community to N-amendment.
              Conversely, for mixed assemblages, N-addition achieved a similar
              reduction in KC through a change in community structure toward
              diatom domination. We generate new understanding and
              parameterization of KC that is particularly critical to advance
              how FRRf can be applied to examine C-uptake throughout the global
              ocean where nitrogen availability is highly variable and thus

              limiting conditions, the mechanism of Prochlorococcus’ cobalt
              uptake was investigated. Due to low quotas, Prochlorococcus MIT
              9215 can maintain growth at extremely slow rates of cobalt uptake,
              circa 1 atom per cell per hour. Cobalt quotas were linearly
              related to the concentration of inorganic cobalt species, Co0,
              indicating that the metal binding sites on the transporter are
              strongly unsaturated with respect to cobalt. When limited by
              cobalt, Prochlorococcus growth rates decreased at high levels of
              both Zn and Mn, suggesting that both metals compete with cobalt
              for the same transporter. This effect was not observed under a
              wide range of Fe, Cu, and Ni concentrations, although the onset of
              exponential growth was delayed at high Ni. These observations
              agree with prior characterizations of the periplasmic manganese

              achieve high productivity through their photosynthetic
              dinoflagellate symbionts. Excessive seawater temperature
              destabilises this symbiosis and causes corals to ‘‘bleach,’’
              lowering their photosynthetic capacity. Bleaching poses a serious
              threat to the persistence of coral reefs on a global scale.
              Despite expanding research on the causes of bleaching, the
              mechanisms remain a subject of debate. Methodology/Principal
              Findings: This study determined how light and food availability
              modulate the effects of temperature stress on photosynthesis in
              two reef coral species. We quantified the activities of
              Photosystem II, Photosystem I and whole chain electron transport
              under combinations of normal and stressful growth temperatures,
              moderate and high light levels and the presence or absence of
              feeding of the coral hosts. Our results show that PS1 function is
              comparatively robust against temperature stress in both species,
              whereas PS2 and whole chain electron transport are susceptible to
              temperature stress. In the symbiotic dinoflagellates of Stylophora
              pistillata the contents of chlorophyll and major photosynthetic
              complexes were primarily affected by food availability. In
              Turbinaria reniformis growth temperature was the dominant
              influence on the contents of the photosynthetic complexes. In both
              species feeding the host significantly protected photosynthetic
              function from high temperature stress. Conclusions/Significance:
              Our findings support the photoinhibition model of coral bleaching
              and demonstrate that PS1 is not a major site for thermal damage
              during bleaching events. Feeding mitigates bleaching in two
              scleractinian corals, so that reef responses to temperature
              stresses will likely be influenced by the coinciding
              availabilities of prey for the host.",

              stands is at least as effective as mixing tree species within
              stands. Given the managerial advantages of between-stand mixtures
              (e.g. reduced need to control competition to maintain diversity,
              higher timber quality, lower logistic effort), we conclude that

              appeared critically important for explaining temporal dynamics and
              for obtaining a complete seasonal mass balance of Antarctic

              the mechanisms underlying their ability to recover from bleaching
              and persist are not fully understood. We used shotgun proteomics
              to compare the proteomes of the outer layer (OL) tissue and inner
              core (IC) tissue and skeleton compartments of experimentally
              bleached and control (i.e., non-bleached) colonies of Montipora
              capitata, a perforate Hawaiian species noted for its resilience
              after bleaching. We identiﬁed 2,361 proteins in the OL and IC
              compartments for both bleached and non-bleached individuals. In
              the OL of bleached corals, 63 proteins were signiﬁcantly more
              abundant and 28 were signiﬁcantly less abundant compared to the OL
              of nonbleached corals. In the IC of bleached corals, 22 proteins
              were signiﬁcantly more abundant and 17 were signiﬁcantly less
              abundant compared to the IC of non-bleached corals. Gene ontology
              (GO) and pathway analyses revealed metabolic processes that were
              occurring in bleached corals but not in non-bleached corals. The
              OL of bleached corals used the glyoxylate cycle to derive carbon
              from internal storage compounds such as lipids, had a high protein
              turnover rate, and shifted reliance on nitrogen from ammonia to
              nitrogen produced from the breakdown of urea and betaine. The IC
              of bleached corals compartmentalized the shunting of glucose to
              the pentose phosphate pathway. Bleached corals increased
              abundances of several antioxidant proteins in both the OL and IC
              compartments compared to non-bleached corals. These results
              highlight contrasting strategies for responding to bleaching
              stress in different compartments of bleached M. capitata and shed

              abundant and many rare species. This pattern is particularly
              prominent in microbial communities, in which most constituent taxa
              are usually extremely rare. Although abundant and rare
              subcommunities may present intrinsic characteristics that could be
              crucial for understanding community dynamics and ecosystem
              functioning, microbiologists normally do not differentiate between
              them. Here, we investigate abundant and rare subcommunities of
              marine microbial eukaryotes, a crucial group of organisms that
              remains among the least-explored biodiversity components of the
              biosphere. We surveyed surface waters of six separate coastal
              locations in Europe, independently considering the picoplankton,
              nanoplankton, and microplankton/mesoplankton organismal size
              fractions. RESULTS: Deep Illumina sequencing of the 18S rRNA
              indicated that the abundant regional community was mostly
              structured by organismal size fraction, whereas the rare regional
              community was mainly structured by geographic origin. However,
              some abundant and rare taxa presented similar biogeography,
              pointing to spatiotemporal structure in the rare microeukaryote
              biosphere. Abundant and rare subcommunities presented regular
              proportions across samples, indicating similar species-abundance
              distributions despite taxonomic compositional variation. Several
              taxa were abundant in one location and rare in other locations,
              suggesting large oscillations in abundance. The substantial amount
              of metabolically active lineages found in the rare biosphere
              suggests that this subcommunity constitutes a diversity reservoir
              that can respond rapidly to environmental change. CONCLUSIONS: We
              propose that marine planktonic microeukaryote assemblages
              incorporate dynamic and metabolically active abundant and rare
              subcommunities, with contrasting structuring patterns but fairly
              regular proportions, across space and time.",

              however, well-documented biases arise in all methods of peer

              participants in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics
              (STEM) fields, we investigated the pervasiveness and author
              perceptions of long-term implications of receiving of

              perceptions of scientific aptitude, productivity, and career

              We show that survey respondents across four intersecting

              peer review comments equally. However, traditionally

  abstract = "Diatoms are a dominant group of eukaryotic phytoplankton that
              contribute substantially to global primary production and the
              cycling of important elements such as carbon and nitrogen.
              Heterotrophic bacteria, including members of the
              gammaproteobacteria, are commonly associated with diatom
              populations and may rely on them for organic carbon while
              potentially competing with them for other essential nutrients.
              Considering that bacterioplankton drive oceanic release of CO2
              (i.e., bacterial respiration) while diatoms drive ocean carbon
              sequestration vial the biological pump, the outcome of such
              competition could inﬂuence the direction and magnitude of carbon
              ﬂux in the upper ocean. Nitrate availability is commonly a
              determining factor for the growth of diatom populations,
              particularly in coastal and upwelling regions. Diatoms as well as
              many bacterial species can utilize nitrate, however the ability of
              bacteria to compete for nitrate may be hindered by carbon
              limitation. Here we have developed a genetically tractable model
              system using the pennate diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum and the
              widespread heterotrophic bacteria Alteromonas macleodii to examine
              carbon-nitrogen dynamics. While subsisting solely on P.
              tricornutum derived carbon, A. macleodii does not appear to be an
              effective competitor for nitrate, and may in fact beneﬁt the
              diatom; particularly in stationary phase. However, allochthonous
              dissolved organic carbon addition in the form of pyruvate triggers
              A. macleodii proliferation and nitrate uptake, leading to reduced
              P. tricornutum growth. Nitrate reductase deﬁcient mutants of A.
              macleodii ( nasA) do not exhibit such explosive growth and
              associated competitive ability in response to allochthonous carbon
              when nitrate is the sole nitrogen source, but could survive by
              utilizing solely P. tricornutum-derived nitrogen. Furthermore,
              allocthonous carbon addition enables wild-type A. macleodii to
              rescue nitrate reductase deﬁcient P. tricornutum populations from
              nitrogen starvation, and RNA-seq transcriptomic evidence supports
              nitrogen-based interactions between diatoms and bacteria at the
              molecular level. This study provides key insights into the roles
              of carbon and nitrogen in phytoplankton-bacteria dynamics and lays
              the foundation for developing a mechanistic understanding of these
              interactions using co-culturing and genetic manipulation.",

              and iron limitation of surface water phytoplankton communities in
              late Austral summer. Cobalamin is produced only by bacteria and
              archaea, suggesting phytoplankton–bacterial interactions must play
              a role in this limitation. To characterize these interactions and
              investigate the molecular basis of multiple nutrient limitation,
              we examined transitions in global gene expression over short time
              scales, induced by shifts in micronutrient availability. Diatoms,
              the dominant primary producers, exhibited transcriptional patterns
              indicative of co-occurring iron and cobalamin deprivation. The
              major contributor to cobalamin biosynthesis gene expression was a
              gammaproteobacterial population, Oceanospirillaceae ASP10-02a.
              This group also contributed significantly to metagenomic cobalamin
              biosynthesis gene abundance throughout Southern Ocean surface
              waters. Oceanospirillaceae ASP10-02a displayed elevated expression
              of organic matter acquisition and cell surface attachment-related

              are dependent on phytoplankton growth to fuel cobalamin
              production. Separate bacterial groups, including Methylophaga ,
              appeared to rely on phytoplankton for carbon and energy sources,
              but displayed gene expression patterns consistent with iron and
              cobalamin deprivation. This suggests they also compete with
              phytoplankton and are important cobalamin consumers. Expression
              patterns of siderophore- related genes offer evidence for
              bacterial influences on iron availability as well. The nature and
              degree of this episodic colimitation appear to be mediated by a

              Bisphenol A, both an extensively used plastic additive and

              on photochemical efficiency of in hospite Symbiodinium within the

              intensity, for corals from two reef zones (forereef, nearshore) on

              molecular responses of in hospite Symbiodinium to these stressors
              via genome-wide gene expression profiling. Elevated temperatures
              reduced symbiont photochemical efficiencies and were highly
              correlated with coral color loss. However, photochemical
              efficiencies of forereef symbionts were more negatively affected
              by thermal stress than nearshore symbionts, suggesting greater
              thermal tolerance and/or reduced photodamage in nearshore corals.
              At control temperatures, CO2-acidification had little effect on
              symbiont physiology, although forereef symbionts exhibited
              constitutively higher photochemical efficiencies than nearshore
              symbionts. Gene expression profiling revealed that S. siderea were
              dominated by Symbiodinium goreaui (C1), except under thermal
              stress, which caused shifts to thermotolerant Symbiodinium

              Although S. goreaui transcriptomes did not vary in response to
              acidification stress, their gene expression was strongly dependent
              on reef zone, with forereef S. goreaui exhibiting enrichment of
              genes associated with photosynthesis. This finding, coupled with
              constitutively higher forereef S. goreaui photochemical

              Settlement substrates were fabricated from calcium carbonate, a

              Hawaiian coral Montipora capitata to natural thermal stress.

              bleaching responses during the 2014–2015 event in Kāne‘ohe Bay
              (O‘ahu, Hawai‘i) and exposed to four different artificial
              temperature pre-treatments (and a control at ambient temperature).
              After recovery, fragments experienced a natural thermal stress
              event either in laboratory conditions or their native reef
              environment. Response to thermal stress was quantified by

              Historical bleaching phenotype was reflected in stable differences
              in symbiont community composition, with historically bleached
              corals containing only Cladocopium symbionts and historically
              non-bleached corals having mixed symbiont communities dominated by

              pre-treatments exposed corals to more thermal stress than

              substantial restructuring between the pre- and post-moult stages
              of the moult cycle. Proportions of protein, lipid and ash were
              high at the premoult stage, reﬂecting growth and nutrient

              facilitate subsequent growth. Polar lipid was the dominant lipid
              class, accounting for N90\% of the total lipid content.
              Conversely, triacylglycerol concentrations were low (b5\%),

              (DHA, 22:6n-3) (9.2 and 7.6\% of the dietary lipid source,

              mechanisms, including disruption of coral microbiomes. Here we
              report the results of a 3-year field experiment simulating
              overfishing and nutrient pollution. These stressors increase turf
              and macroalgal cover, destabilizing microbiomes, elevating
              putative pathogen loads, increasing disease more than twofold and
              increasing mortality up to eightfold. Above-average temperatures
              exacerbate these effects, further disrupting microbiomes of
              unhealthy corals and concentrating 80\% of mortality in the
              warmest seasons. Surprisingly, nutrients also increase bacterial
              opportunism and mortality in corals bitten by parrotfish, turning
              normal trophic interactions deadly for corals. Thus, overfishing
              and nutrient pollution impact reefs down to microbial scales,
              killing corals by sensitizing them to predation, above-average
              temperatures and bacterial opportunism.",

              are difficult to estimate. Here, we use expert and ocean-user
              opinion surveys to estimate baselines of global coral reef cover.
              The overall mean estimated baseline coral cover was 59\% (±19\%

              settlement, it remains unclear whether coral larvae respond to CCA
              metabolites and microbial cues when selecting sites for attachment
              and metamorphosis. This study tested the settlement preferences of
              an abundant coral species ( Acropora cytherea ) against six
              different CCA species from three habitats (exposed, subcryptic and
              cryptic), and compared these preferences with the metabolome and
              microbiome characterizing the CCA. While all CCA species induced
              settlement, only one species ( Titanoderma prototypum )
              significantly promoted settlement on the CCA surface, rather than
              on nearby dead coral or plastic surfaces. This species had a very
              distinct bacterial community and metabolomic fingerprint.
              Furthermore, coral settlement rates and the CCA microbiome and

              engineers and therefore represent important targets for ocean

              associated microbiome using carbon uptake, decalcification assays,

              benthic substrate, stabilizing the reef structure and inducing
              coral settlement. An important feature of CCA is the ability to
              keep their surfaces free of epiphytic algae, thereby reducing
              algal overgrowth and allowing them access to light. However, the
              mechanisms by which CCA prevent settlement of opportunistic
              seaweeds (fleshy macroalgae) are not fully understood, nor is
              whether these mechanisms vary among CCA species. In our study
              based on the Great Barrier Reef, we demonstrate that three common
              CCA species (Titanoderma pustulatum, Porolithon onkodes and
              Neogoniolithon sp.) have a remarkable ability to deter settlement
              of seaweed spores. We provide experimental evidence that the CCA
              use allelopathy and microbial inhibition against the settlement of
              spores of the brown seaweed Padina boergesenii. Methanol extracts
              of allelopathic compounds from T. pustulatum, Po. onkodes and

              Further, we found that microbial biofilms, while having a lower

              seaweed settlement of Pa. boergesenii. Our study demonstrates that
              allelopathy and microbial inhibition, in addition to epithallial
              tissue sloughing, are mechanisms employed by CCA to prevent the
              settlement of epiphytic algae. Understanding the mechanisms by
              which CCA avoid seaweed overgrowth contributes to our

              abundance, species invasions and local to regional extinctions.
              More records existed for canopy-forming kelps and bladed and
              filamentous turf-forming seaweeds than for canopy-forming fucoids,

              Turf-forming seaweeds, especially invasive seaweeds, generally

              kelps and fucoids typically declined in abundance. We also found

              necessity of better baseline information regarding seaweed

              characteristics of MHWs that affect the vulnerability and
              resilience of seaweeds to these increasingly important climatic
              perturbations. A major challenge will be to disentangle impacts

              nutrient content, solar radiation and desiccation stress in the

              of microfibers and marine organisms is limited. In this study we
              examined the ingestion of microfibers by the sea anemone Aiptasia
              pallida using three different types of polymers: nylon, polyester
              and polypropylene. The polymers were offered to both symbiotic
              (with algal symbionts) and bleached (without algal symbionts)
              anemones. The polymers were introduced either alone or mixed with
              brine shrimp homogenate. We observed a higher percentage of nylon
              ingestion compared to the other polymers when plastic was offered
              in the absence of shrimp. In contrast, we observed over 80\% of
              the anemones taking up all types of polymers when the plastics
              were offered in the presence of shrimp. Retention time differed

              of microfibers by sea anemones is dependent both on the type of

              The decreased ability of bleached anemones to reject plastic

              human activity and climate change, threatening the extinction of
              several major reef ecosystems. Reef damage is mediated by a
              process called ‘coral bleaching’ where corals, sea anemones, and
              other cnidarians lose their photosynthetic algal symbionts (family
              Symbiodiniaceae) upon stress induction, resulting in drastically
              decreased host energy harvest and, ultimately, coral death. The
              mechanism by which this critical cnidarian-algal symbiosis is lost
              remains poorly understood. The larvae of the sea anemone,
              Exaiptasia pallida (commonly referred to as ‘Aiptasia’) are an
              attractive model organism to study this process, but they are
              large (∼100 mm in length, ∼75 mm in diameter), deformable, and
              highly motile, complicating long-term imaging and limiting study
              of this critical endosymbiotic relationship in live organisms.
              Here, we report ‘Traptasia’, a simple microfluidic device with
              multiple traps designed to isolate and image individual, live
              larvae of Aiptasia and their algal symbionts over extended time
              courses. Using a trap design parameterized via fluid flow
              simulations and polymer bead loading tests, we trapped Aiptasia
              larvae containing algal symbionts and demonstrated stable imaging
              for >10 hours. We visualized algae within Aiptasia larvae and
              observed algal expulsion under an environmental stressor. To our
              knowledge, this device is the first to enable time-lapsed,
              high-throughput live imaging of cnidarian larvae and their algal
              symbionts and, in further implementation, could provide important
              insights into the cellular mechanisms of cnidarian bleaching under
              different environmental stressors. The ‘Traptasia’ device is
              simple to use, requires minimal external equipment and no
              specialized training to operate, and can easily be adapted using
              the trap optimization data presented here to study a variety of

              resultant carbonate structure is key for explaining their
              ecological success, as it provides protection against herbivores
              and resistance to water motion. However, its potential
              contribution to enhance thallus light absorption efficiency
              through multiple light scattering on algal skeleton, similar to
              the effect documented for scleractinian corals, has not been yet
              investigated. Here, we initiate this analysis, characterizing
              thallus optical properties of three coralline species, which
              differed in pigment content and thallus mass area (TMA, gDW m−2).
              The three species, the rhodolith Neogoniolithon sp., the crustose
              coralline alga (CCA), Lithothamnion sp., and the articulated alga
              Amphiroa tribulus, represent the more distinctive coralline
              growth-forms and are able to colonize contrasting light
              environments in Caribbean coral reefs. The thicker thalli of the
              rhodoliths were the most efficient light collectors, as evidenced
              by their higher pigment absorption efficiency (a*Chla; m2
              mgChla−1) and photosynthetic rates per unit area. This could
              explain rhodolith success in oligotrophic, highly illuminated reef
              environments. In contrast, the thinner thalli of the CCA, a
              low-light specialist, showed the highest metabolic rates
              normalized to mass and the highest light absorption efficiencies
              per unit mass (a*M; m2 gdw−1). Therefore, the ecological success
              of the CCA in cryptic habitats within the reef cannot be explained
              only by its low-light physiology, but also by its capacity to
              reduce the structural costs of their thalli, and thus of its new
              growth. Lastly, the ecological success of Amphiroa tribulus, which
              displayed intermediate values for the efficiency of light
              absorption, metabolic rates and TMA, was explained by its ability
              to construct the largest light collectors (algal canopies) thanks
              to the presence of flexible, non-calcified segments (genicula).
              This ability enables enhanced photosynthetic and carbonate
              production at the organism/canopy level. The resulting fragile
              canopy survives best within the protection provided by colonies of
              the lettuce coral Agaricia agaricites. In conclusion, our study
              demonstrates the utility of optical traits as powerful tools to
              investigate differences in the competitive abilities, abundances
              and niche distribution among algal species and/or growth-forms.",

              that globally decreases plant production by impairing various
              physiological, biochemical, and molecular function. In particular,
              salinity hampers germina­ tion, growth, photosynthesis,
              transpiration, and stomatal conductance. Salinity decreases leaf
              water potential and turgor pressure and generates osmotic stress.
              Salinity enhances reactive oxygen species (ROS) content in the
              plant cell as a result of ion toxicity and disturbs ion
              homeostasis. Thus, it imbalances nutrient uptake, disinte­ grates
              membrane, and various ultrastructure. Consequently, salinity leads
              to osmotic and ionic stress. Plants respond to salinity by
              modulating various morpho-physiological, anatomical, and
              biochemical traits by regu­ lating ion homeostasis and
              compartmentalization, antioxidant machinery, and biosynthesis of
              osmoprotectants and phytohormones, i. e, auxins, abscisic acid,
              brassinosteroids, cytokinins, ethylene, gibberellins, salicylic
              acid, jasmonic acid, and polyamines. Thus, this further modulates
              plant osmoticum, decreases ion toxicity, and scavenges ROS. Plants
              upregulate various genes and proteins that participate in salinity
              tolerance. They also promote the production of various
              phytohormones and metabolites that mitigate the toxic effect of
              salinity. Based on recent papers, the deleterious effect of
              salinity on plant physiology is discussed. Furthermore, it
              evaluates the physiological and biochemical responses of the plant
              to salinity along with phytohormone response. This review paper
              also highlights omics (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and
              metabolomics) approach to understand salt stress tolerance.",

              supply of new recruits to marine ecosystem. The input of new
              propagules to coral reefs relies on spawning events that display
              remarkable synchronicity during limited periods each year.
              Although the timing of spawning is known for most species, other
              aspects of coral reproduction (polyp fecundity or spawning
              synchronicity) are less understood. This largely reflects the
              sporadic nature of reproductive activities and logistical problems
              of studying the ephemeral coral spawning events in situ on the
              reef at night. Here, we address this gap by exploring the spatial
              and temporal spawning dynamics of Montipora capitata, a
              broadcast-spawning, reef-building coral from the central Pacific
              Ocean, by using the systematic sampling of gametes in the field.
              Our results indicate that spawning in this species varies among
              years, months and lunar days, and that the proportion of colonies
              spawning and synchrony of spawning do not reflect coral colony
              morphology, colony size or the differences in environments between
              sites within a year. Major differences in reproductive outputs
              (spawned material) were observed between the 2 yr studied, which
              most probably reflects variability in temperature between years or
              shifts in the timing of spawning (phenology). This study
              highlights the complexity of spawning dynamics in corals and
              suggests that a more comprehensive understanding of interplay

              Coral reefs are biologically diverse and productive marine
              ecosystems, whose success is framed by symbiosis between
              reefbuilding corals and unicellular dinoflagellates in the genus
              Symbiodinium. Many corals produce aposymbiotic larvae that are
              infected by Symbiodinium from the environment (horizontal
              transmission), which allows for the acquisition of new
              endosymbionts (different from their parents) each generation. In
              the remaining species, Symbiodinium are transmitted directly from
              parent to offspring via eggs (vertical transmission), a mechanism
              that perpetuates the relationship between some or all of the
              Symbiodinium diversity found in the parent through multiple

              coral Montipora capitata by comparing the Symbiodinium ITS2

              Parental effects on sequence assemblages in eggs are explored in
              the context of the coral genotype, colony morphology, and the
              environment of parent colonies. Our results indicate that ITS2
              sequence assemblages in eggs are generally similar to their
              parents, and patterns in parental assemblages are different, and
              reflect environmental conditions, but not colony morphology or
              coral genotype. We conclude that eggs released by parent colonies
              during mass spawning events are seeded with different ITS2

              vulnerability. These refugia may provide ecosystem goods and
              services for longer so should be considered as potential
              conservation and restoration priorities. This project team
              previously developed projections of the exposure component of
              climate vulnerability in coral reef areas. These projections were
              based on the World Climate Research Programme’s Working Group on
              Coupled Modelling (WGCM) Coupled Model Intercomparison Project
              Phase 5 (CMIP5) generation of climate models (used by the IPCC in
              the 5th Assessment Report – AR5). These projections, which were
              statistically downscaled to 4-km are reviewed in UNEP (2017) and
              van Hooidonk et al. (2016). This report updates the UNEP 2017
              report with projections of the timing of severe coral bleaching
              conditions using the new generation of climate models used by the
              IPCC – the CMIP6 generation of models. The motivation in providing
              this update is that some CMIP6 models have >4x the spatial
              resolution (some have native resolutions of ¼ x ¼°; ~ 27 x 27km at
              the equator) than CMIP5 models (native resolution of 1 x 1°; ~110
              x 110km) and include other improvements. Further, the CMIP6 models
              are forced by the recently released Shared Socioeconomic Pathways
              (SSPs – see Riahi (2017) for an overview). The CMIP6 models
              represent the current state-of-the-art in climate modeling to
              deliver climate science that informs regional and global climate
              policy. These projections presented here are of future exposure to
              bleaching conditions (i.e., temperature stress); the socio-ecology
              of coral reefs within all grid cells will vary and this variance
              is not built into these projections. Projections of the timing of
              annual severe bleaching conditions are compared in this report for
              SSP5-8.5 and SSP2-4.5 to examine the implications of climate
              policy for coral reefs. SSP5-8.5 is the pathway that represents
              current rates of emissions and emissions growth; it is also
              considered a “worst-case scenario”. This scenario assumes there is
              no climate policy or that policy is not effective. SSP5-8.5
              represents a growing world economy heavily dependent on fossil
              fuels. Results from the SSP5-8.5 pathway are most of the focus of
              this report and can be seen as using the precautionary principle
              in planning. SSP2-4.5 is a highly ambitious but plausible
              scenario. SSP2-4.5 is a “middle of the road” pathway in which
              emissions continue to increase through the end of the century,
              reaching between 65GtCO2 and 85GtCO2, with resulting warming of
              3.8-4.2°C. This scenario was selected because it could represent
              future conditions if greater levels of emissions reduction (~150\%
              of pledges) are achieved than would result from all Nationally
              Determined Contributions in the Paris Agreement combined. The
              purpose of this report is threefold: 1. To present projections of
              coral bleaching conditions (i.e., exposure to the primary climate
              threat to coral reefs) and potential adaptation at a spatial scale
              that enables use of the data in management and conservation
              planning and in support of other decisions influencing coral reefs
              and reef use; 2. To evaluate the implications of the Paris
              Agreement as well as failure to achieve its goal, by comparing the
              projected timing of annual severe bleaching between Shared
              Socioeconomic Pathways SSP5-8.5 and SSP2-4.5; and 3. To provide
              public access to the projections data as well as the main findings
              to catalyze research that extends the purposes and applications
              described in 1 and 2, and informs new research. The report has
              been prepared with the coral reef scientific and management
              community as the primary target audience. Results highlights
              include: • Under the fossil-fuel aggressive SSP5-8.5, ASB is
              projected to occur within this century for 100\% of the world’s
              coral reefs. The average projected year of ASB is 2034, nine years
              earlier than was projected as a global average for RCP8.5 using
              CMIP5 models. This suggests the previous CMIP5 generation of
              projections of future bleaching conditions underestimated the near
              future threat of annual severe bleaching. • Projected exposure to
              annual severe bleaching conditions varies greatly among and within
              countries under SSP5-8.5. Coral reefs with relatively early and
              late exposure to annual bleaching conditions occur in all of the
              ocean basins; however, some countries have more temporary refugia
              than others. Six of the 20 countries with the greatest reef area
              have >25\% temporary refugia (i.e., projected ASB after 2044),
              including: Indonesia (35\%), western Australia (70\%), The Bahamas
              (26\%), Madagascar (30\%), India (37\%), and Malaysia (47\%).
              Thirteen of the 20 countries with the greatest reef area have
              >25\% of reef areas that are projected to experience annual
              bleaching conditions relatively early. Some of these countries
              include the Philippines, Solomon Islands, Fuji, Cuba, and Saudi
              Arabia. It is important to note that these projections should not
              be interpreted as predictions of exactly when bleaching will occur
              and do not imply that any reef areas, including relative refugia,
              are safe from severe bleaching. • The average year for the
              projected timing of ASB under SSP2-4.5 is 2045, 11 years later
              than the average year projected under SSP5-8.5. Successful
              mitigation in line with the Paris Agreement would do little to
              provide reefs with more time to adapt or acclimate prior to severe
              coral bleaching conditions occurring annually. There are three
              major results from the projections that assume coral adaptation
              levels between 0.25° and 2°C: 1) Each quarter degree of assumed
              adaptation adds ~7 years to the global average timing of projected
              annual severe bleaching; 2) The great majority of coral reefs
              (>80\%) are expected to experience ASB this century even if 2°C of
              adaptation is assumed; 3) There is great spatial variation in the
              benefits to reefs, in terms of later ASB timing, at each assumed
              adaption level. The extent to which corals will adapt to
              increasing sea temperatures is unknown, but some level of
              adaptation is expected. If we assume 1°C of adaptation, the global
              average ASB timing is ~30 years later than if no adaptation is
              assumed. The projections describe and quantify climate change
              exposure of coral reefs and thus contribute to our understanding
              of coral reef vulnerability. These projections can guide
              management, conservation and restoration planning, and be used in
              education and outreach programs. Recommendations for next steps
              and research priorities include: downscaling the projections to
              5-km scale to distinguish what are known to be local-scale
              differences in average summer temperatures and the bleaching
              threshold; better understanding the drivers and spatial patterns
              of coral and coral community adaptation to thermal stress; and,
              combining the projections with analyses of bleaching observations
              to identify reef areas that have fared better (‘bright spots’) or
              worse (‘dark spots’) than expected during recent bleaching events.
              Advances in any of those areas will increase confidence in the
              projections as well as the capacity of managers to use the
              projections in conservation planning, policy, and stakeholder
              engagement and outreach.",

              how they differ in size and gene inventory, putatively due to

              to predict regulatory components of the transcriptional networks

              due to their susceptibility to both OW and OA. OW poses the

              cause mass bleaching events and mortality of corals. Marine
              heatwaves are projected to increase in frequency, intensity, and

              coral reefs will be able to persist as functioning ecosystems and

              the success of corals. However, an array of other microorganisms
              associated with coral (i.e., Bacteria, Archaea, Fungi, and
              viruses) have a complex and intricate role in maintaining
              homeostasis between corals and Symbiodinium. Corals are sensitive
              to shifts in the surrounding environmental conditions. One of the
              most widely reported responses of coral to stressful environmental
              conditions is bleaching. During this event, corals expel
              Symbiodinium cells from their gastrodermal tissues upon
              experiencing extended seawater temperatures above their thermal
              threshold. An array of other environmental stressors can also
              destabilize the coral microbiome, resulting in compromised health
              of the host, which may include disease and mortality in the worst
              scenario. However, the exact mechanisms by which the coral
              microbiome supports coral health and increases resilience are
              poorly understood. Earlier studies of coral microbiology proposed
              a coral probiotic hypothesis, wherein a dynamic relationship
              exists between corals and their symbiotic microorganisms,
              selecting for the coral holobiont that is best suited for the
              prevailing environmental conditions. Here, we discuss the
              microbial-host relationships within the coral holobiont, along
              with their potential roles in maintaining coral health. We propose
              the term BMC (Beneficial Microorganisms for Corals) to define
              (specific) symbionts that promote coral health. This term and
              concept are analogous to the term Plant Growth Promoting
              Rhizosphere (PGPR), which has been widely explored and manipulated
              in the agricultural industry for microorganisms that inhabit the
              rhizosphere and directly or indirectly promote plant growth and
              development through the production of regulatory signals,
              antibiotics and nutrients. Additionally, we propose and discuss
              the potential mechanisms of the effects of BMC on corals,
              suggesting strategies for the use of this knowledge to manipulate
              the microbiome, reversing dysbiosis to restore and protect coral
              reefs. This may include developing and using BMC consortia as
              environmental “probiotics” to improve coral resistance after

              does this clearly maladaptive process occur? Bleaching may result
              from evolutionary conflict between the host corals and their
              symbionts. Selection at the level of the individual symbiont
              favors using the products of photosynthesis for selfish
              replication, while selection at the higher level favors using
              these products for growth of the entire host/symbiont community.
              To hold the selfish lower-level units in check, mechanisms of
              conflict mediation must evolve. Fundamental features of
              photosynthesis have been co-opted into conflict mediation so that
              symbionts that fail to export these products produce high levels
              of reactive oxygen species and undergo programmed cell death.
              These mechanisms function very well under most environmental
              conditions, but under conditions particularly detrimental to
              photosynthesis, it is these mechanisms of conflict mediation that

              production of damaging reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the

              because of perturbations of other processes occurring within the

              secondary responses to temperature increase. The processes

              which is caused by the interaction between high irradiance and
              elevated seawater temperatures, and involves the mass expulsion of
              Symbiodiniaceae from anemones, sponges, and corals. The primary
              drivers of this phenomenon are the inherent genetic variability in
              the Family Symbiodiniaceae, and the variability in the abiotic
              environment for variables such as irradiance and temperature.
              Recent experiments have either disregarded the important
              interactive role of irradiance or have suggested that
              photooxidative stress is not a prerequisite for coral bleaching
              because certain reactive oxygen species (ROS) can be produced in
              the dark. Here, fluorescent probes are used as proxies for the
              relative concentration of ROS in different genera of cultured
              Symbiodiniaceae under varying thermal and light conditions. The
              results show that taxon-specific patterns of the concentration of

              compared to singlet oxygen, when exposed to high light and thermal

              primary drivers of ROS production and the photo-physiological

              toxicity mechanism(s) are not understood, hampering development of

              of a sea anemone under simulated sunlight including ultraviolet
              (UV) radiation (290 to 370 nanometers). Although oxybenzone itself
              protected against UV-induced photo-oxidation, both the anemone and
              a mushroom coral formed oxybenzone–glucoside conjugates that were
              strong photo-oxidants. Algal symbionts sequestered these
              conjugates, and mortality correlated with conjugate concentrations

              photosynthetic oxygen evolution, and (3) decreases in optimal
              quantum yield (Fv/Fm) of photosystem II (PSII). Quantum yield
              decreased to a greater extent on the illuminated surfaces of coral
              branches than on lower (shaded) surfaces, and also when high
              irradiance intensities were combined with elevated temperature (33
              °C as opposed to 28 °C). qN collapsed in heat-stressed samples
              when quenching analysis was conducted in the absence of oxygen.
              Collectively, these observations are interpreted as the initiation
              of photoprotective dissipation of excess absorbed energy as heat
              (qN) and O2-dependent electron flow through the
              Mehler-Ascorbate-Peroxidase cycle (MAP-cycle) following the point
              at which the rate of light-driven electron transport exceeds the

              proposed whereby the primary site of heat damage in S. pistillata
              is carboxylation within the Calvin cycle, as has been observed
              during heat damage in higher plants. Damage to PSII and a
              reduction in Fv/Fm (i.e. photoinhibition) are secondary effects
              following the overwhelming of photoprotective mechanisms by light.
              This secondary factor increases the effect of the primary
              variable, temperature. Potential restrictions of electron flow in
              heat-stressed zooxanthellae are discussed with respect to Calvin
              cycle enzymes and the unusual status of the dinoflagellate
              Rubisco. Significant features of our model are that (1) damage to
              PSII is not the initial step in the sequence of heat stress in
              zooxanthellae, and (2) light plays a key secondary role in the

              is also required for adaptation to low temperature conditions.,
              Diacylglyceryl-N,N,N-trimethylhomo-Ser (DGTS) is a nonphosphorous,
              polar glycerolipid that is regarded as analogous to the
              phosphatidylcholine in bacteria, fungi, algae, and basal land
              plants. In some species of algae, including the stramenopile
              microalga Nannochloropsis oceanica, DGTS contains an abundance of
              eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), which is relatively scarce in
              phosphatidylcholine, implying that DGTS has a unique physiological
              role. In this study, we addressed the role of DGTS in N. oceanica.
              We identified two DGTS biosynthetic enzymes that have distinct
              domain configurations compared to previously identified DGTS
              synthases. Mutants lacking DGTS showed growth retardation under
              phosphate starvation, demonstrating a pivotal role for DGTS in the
              adaptation to this condition. Under normal conditions, DGTS
              deficiency led to an increase in the relative amount of
              monogalactosyldiacylglycerol, a major plastid membrane lipid with
              high EPA content, whereas excessive production of DGTS induced by
              gene overexpression led to a decrease in
              monogalactosyldiacylglycerol. Meanwhile, lipid analysis of partial
              phospholipid-deficient mutants revealed a role for
              phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine in EPA
              biosynthesis. These results suggest that DGTS and
              monogalactosyldiacylglycerol may constitute the two major pools of
              EPA in extraplastidic and plastidic membranes, partially competing
              to acquire EPA or its precursors derived from phospholipids. The
              mutant lacking DGTS also displayed impaired growth and a lower

                 Understanding the distribution and abundance of heat tolerant
                 corals across seascapes is imperative for predicting responses
                 to climate change and to support novel management actions.
                 Rapid and high-throughput methods to measure heat-induced coral
                 bleaching sensitivity are increasingly required to understand
                 current and predict future responses to climate change.
                 Experimental evaluations of coral heat and bleaching tolerance
                 typically involve ramp-and-hold experiments run across days to
                 weeks within aquarium facilities with limits to colony
                 replication. Field-based acute heat stress assays have emerged
                 as an alternative experimental approach to rapidly quantify
                 heat tolerance in a large number of samples yet the role of key
                 methodological considerations on the stress response measured
                 remains unresolved. Here, we quantify the effects of coral
                 fragment size, sampling time point, and physiological measures
                 on the acute heat stress response in adult corals. The effect
                 of fragment size differed between species ( Acropora tenuis and
                 Pocillopora damicornis ). Most physiological parameters
                 measured here declined over time (tissue colour, chlorophyll-a
                 and protein content) from the onset of heating, with the
                 exception of maximum photosynthetic efficiency ( F v / F m ),
                 which was stable up to 24h post heating. Based on our
                 experiments, we identified photosynthetic efficiency, tissue
                 colour change, and host-specific assays such as catalase
                 activity as key physiological measures for rapid quantification
                 of thermal tolerance. We recommend that future applications of
                 acute heat stress assays include larger fragments (>9cm 2 )
                 where possible and sample between 10 - 14h after the end of
                 heat stress. A validated high-throughput experimental approach
                 combined with cost-effective genomic and physiological

              surface temperatures. The adaptive bleaching hypothesis (ABH)

              differently to environmental conditions, specifically temperature,
              and (2) bleached adults can secondarily acquire zooxanthellae from

              harbors a single algal strain, Symbiodinium ITS2 type C1f

              the larval stage. The present study examined the early specificity
              events in the onset of symbiosis between F. scutaria larvae and
              Symbiodinium spp., by looking at the temporal and spatial
              infection dynamics of larvae challenged with different symbiont
              types. The results show that specificity at the onset of symbiosis
              was mediated by recognition events during the initial
              symbiont—host physical contact before phagocytosis, and by
              subsequent cellular events after the symbionts were incorporated
              into host cells. Moreover, homologous and heterologous
              Symbiodinium sp. strains did not exhibit the same pattern of

              homologous symbionts (C1f), ~70\% of the total acquired algae were
              found in the equatorial area of the larvae, between the oral and
              aboral ends, 21 h after inoculation. In contrast, no spatial
              difference in algal localization was observed in larvae infected
              with heterologous symbionts. This result provides evidence of
              functional differences among gastrodermal cells, during
              development of the larvae. The cells in the larval equator
              function as nutritive phagocytes, and also appear to function as a

              and perfluorooctane sulfonate. Epidemiological studies have

              function, liver disease, lipid and insulin dysregulation, kidney

              their design e.g. duration of exposure, effect types and endpoints
              measured. Ecotoxicity studies measure biological responses to test
              item exposure. Responses can be highly variable, with limited
              opportunity for control of extrinsic sources of variability. It is
              critical to distinguish between treatment-related effects and
              background ‘normal variability’ when interpreting results.
              Historical control data (HCD) can be a valuable tool in
              contextualising results from single studies against previous
              studies performed under similar conditions. This paper discusses
              the case for better use of HCD in ecotoxicology assessments,
              illustrating with case studies the value and difficulties of using
              HCD in interpretation of results of standard and higher-tier study
              designs. HCD are routinely used in mammalian toxicology for human
              health assessments, but not directly in ecotoxicology. The
              possible reasons for this are discussed e.g., different data
              types, the potential to mask effects, and the lack of guidance.
              These concerns are real but not insurmountable and we would like
              to see organisations such as OECD, EFSA and USEPA develop guidance
              on the principles of HCD collection. Hopefully, this would lead to
              greater use of HCD and regulatory acceptance. We believe this is
              not only a scientifically valid approach but also an ethical issue
              that is in line with societally driven legal mandates to minimise
              the use of vertebrate testing in chemical regulatory decision
              making.",

              to ambient or thermal stress conditions over a 5-week period,
              coinciding with a mass spawning event of this species. The major
              goal of our study was to expand the inventory of thermal
              stress-related genes and metabolites present in M. capitata and to
              study gene-metabolite interactions. These interactions provide the
              foundation for functional or genetic analysis of key coral genes
              as well as provide potentially diagnostic markers of pre-bleaching
              stress. A secondary goal of our study was to analyze the
              accumulation of sex hormones prior to and during mass spawning to
              understand how thermal stress may impact reproductive success in
              M. capitata. Methods M. capitata was exposed to thermal stress
              during its spawning cycle over the course of 5 weeks, during which
              time transcriptomic and polar metabolomic data were collected. We
              analyzed these data streams individually, and then integrated both
              data sets using MAGI (Metabolite Annotation and Gene Integration)
              to investigate molecular transitions and biochemical reactions.
              Results Our results reveal the complexity of the thermal stress
              phenome in M. capitata, which includes many genes involved in
              redox regulation, biomineralization, and reproduction. The size
              and number of modules in the gene co-expression networks expanded
              from the initial stress response to the onset of bleaching. The
              later stages involved the suppression of metabolite transport by
              the coral host, including a variety of sodium-coupled transporters
              and a putative ammonium transporter, possibly as a response to
              reduction in algal productivity. The gene-metabolite integration
              data suggest that thermal treatment results in the activation of
              animal redox stress pathways involved in quenching molecular
              oxygen to prevent an overabundance of reactive oxygen species.
              Lastly, evidence that thermal stress affects reproductive activity
              was provided by the downregulation of CYP-like genes and the
              irregular production of sex hormones during the mass spawning
              cycle. Overall, redox regulation and metabolite transport are key
              components of the coral animal thermal stress phenome. Mass
              spawning was highly attenuated under thermal stress, suggesting
              that global climate change may negatively impact reproductive
              behavior in this species.",

              environments, an evaluation of their toxicity is essential.
              Microplastics are a heterogeneous set of materials that differ not
              only in particle properties, like size and shape, but also in
              chemical composition, including polymers, additives and side
              products. Thus far, it remains unknown whether the plastic
              chemicals or the particle itself are the driving factor for
              microplastic toxicity. To address this question, we exposed
              Daphnia magna for 21 days to irregular polyvinyl chloride (PVC),
              polyurethane (PUR) and polylactic acid (PLA) microplastics as well
              as to natural kaolin particles in high concentrations (10, 50,
              100, 500 mg/L, ≤ 59 μm) and different exposure scenarios,
              including microplastics and microplastics without extractable
              chemicals as well as the extracted and migrating chemicals alone.
              All three microplastic types negatively affected the life-history
              of D. magna. However, this toxicity depended on the endpoint and
              the material. While PVC had the largest effect on reproduction,
              PLA reduced survival most effectively. The latter indicates that
              bio-based and biodegradable plastics can be as toxic as their
              conventional counterparts. The natural particle kaolin was less
              toxic than microplastics when comparing numerical concentrations.
              Importantly, the contribution of plastic chemicals to the toxicity
              was also plastic type-specific. While we can attribute effects of
              PVC to the chemicals used in the material, effects of PUR and PLA
              plastics were induced by the mere particle. Our study demonstrates
              that plastic chemicals can drive microplastic toxicity. This
              highlights the importance of considering the individual chemical
              composition of plastics when assessing their environmental risks.
              Our results suggest that less studied polymer types, like PVC and
              PUR, as well as bioplastics are of particular toxicological
              relevance and should get a higher priority in ecotoxicological
              studies.",

              weight of evidence for microplastics causing environmental harm.
              We conclude that microplastics do occur in surface water and
              sediments. Fragments and fibers predominate, with beads making up
              only a small proportion of the detected microplastic types.
              Concentrations detected are orders of magnitude lower than those
              reported to affect endpoints such as biochemistry, feeding,
              reproduction, growth, tissue inflammation and mortality in
              organisms. The evidence for microplastics acting as a vector for
              hydrophobic organic compounds to accumulate in organisms is also
              weak. The available data therefore suggest that these materials
              are not causing harm to the environment. There is, however, a
              mismatch between the particle types, size ranges, and
              concentrations of microplastics used in laboratory tests and those
              measured in the environment. Select environmental compartments
              have also received limited attention. There is an urgent need for

              the environment and their toxicity in aquatic animals is still a
              matter of intense debate. In this review on PAEs in aquatic
              environments (lakes, rivers and seas), it is found that there is a
              large variety and abundance of PAEs in developing countries, and

              induced by various PAEs is summarized for the first time in the
              article. Exposure of PAEs can lead to activation of the
              detoxification system CYP450 and endocrine system receptors of
              aquatic animals, which in turn causes oxidative stress, metabolic
              disorders, endocrine disorders, and immunosuppression. Meanwhile,

              library. The GOIs are 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases type 14
              (17β HSD14) and type 12 (17β HSD12), Niemann-Pick C type 2 (NPC2),
              Equistatin (EI), Complement component C3 (C3), Cathepsin L (CTSL),

              Desert Hedgehog (DHH), Zinc finger protein GLI2 (GLI2), and

              associations with steroid hormone biosynthesis; cholesterol
              binding/transport; immunity; phagocytosis; or Hedgehog signaling.
              Quantitative Real-Time PCR quantified expression of GOIs. In
              silico modelling utilized protein structures from Protein Data
              Bank as well as creating protein structures with SWISS-MODEL.
              Results show transcription of steroidogenic enzymes, and
              cholesterol binding/transport proteins have similar transcription
              profiles for E2, T, and cholesterol treatments, but different
              profiles when BP-3 or BBP is present. C3 expression can
              differentiate between exposures to BP-3 versus BBP as well as
              exposure to cholesterol versus sex hormones. In silico modelling
              revealed all ligands (E2, T, cholesterol, BBP, and BP-3) have
              favorable binding affinities with 17β HSD14, 17β HSD12, NPC2, SMO,
              and PTCH proteins. VTG expression was down-regulated in the sterol
              treatments but up-regulated in BP-3 and BBP treatments. In

              transcriptional profiles capable of discriminating between the
              five chemical exposures used in this investigation. This suite of
              GOIs are candidate biomarkers for detecting transcriptional

  abstract = "Kaneohe Bay, which is located on the on the NE coast of Oahu,
              Hawaii, represents one of the most intensively studied estuarine
              coral reef ecosystems in the world. Despite a long history of
              anthropogenic disturbance, from early settlement to post European
              contact, the coral reef ecosystem of Kaneohe Bay appears to be in
              better condition in comparison to other reefs around the world.
              The island of Moku o Loe (Coconut Island) in the southern region
              of the bay became home to the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology
              in 1947, where researchers have since documented the various
              aspects of the unique physical, chemical, and biological features
              of this coral reef ecosystem. The first human contact by voyaging
              Polynesians occurred at least 700 years ago. By A. D. 1250
              Polynesians voyagers had settled inhabitable islands in the region
              which led to development of an intensive agricultural, fish pond
              and ocean resource system that supported a large human population.
              Anthropogenic disturbance initially involved clearing of land for
              agriculture, intentional or accidental introduction of alien
              species, modification of streams to supply water for taro culture,
              and construction of massive shoreline fish pond enclosures and
              extensive terraces in the valleys that were used for taro culture.
              The arrival by the first Europeans in 1778 led to further
              introductions of plants and animals that radically changed the
              landscape. Subsequent development of a plantation agricultural
              system led to increased human immigration, population growth and
              an end to traditional land and water management practices. The
              reefs were devastated by extensive dredge and fill operations as
              well as rapid growth of human population, which led to extensive
              urbanization of the watershed. By the 1960' s the bay was severely
              impacted by increased sewage discharge along with increased
              sedimentation due to improper grading practices and stream
              channelization, resulting in extensive loss of coral cover. The
              reefs of Kaneohe Bay developed under estuarine conditions and thus
              have been subjected to multiple natural stresses. These include
              storm floods, a more extreme temperature range than more oceanic
              reefs, high rates of sedimentation, and exposure at extreme low
              tides. Deposition and degradation of organic materials carried
              into the bay from the watershed results in low pH conditions such
              that according to some ocean acidification projections the rich
              coral reefs in the bay should not exist. Increased global
              temperature due to anthropogenic fossil fuel emmisions is now
              impacting these reefs with the first ``bleaching event'' in 1996
              and a second more severe event in 2014. The reefs of Kaneohe Bay
              have developed and persist under rather severe natural and
              anthropogenic perturbations. To date, these reefs have proved to
              be very resilient once the stressor has been removed. A major
              question remains to be answered concerning the limits of Kaneohe
              Bay reef resilience in the face of global climate change.",

              several findings. First, across the past five decades,
              psychological publications that highlight race have been rare, and
              although they have increased in developmental and social
              psychology, they have remained virtually nonexistent in cognitive
              psychology. Second, most publications have been edited by White
              editors, under which there have been significantly fewer
              publications that highlight race. Third, many of the publications
              that highlight race have been written by White authors who
              employed significantly fewer participants of color. In many cases,
              we document variation as a function of area and decade. We argue

               and access to land. Focusing on plastic pollution, the book
               models an anticolonial scientific practice aligned with
               Indigenous, particularly Métis, concepts of land, ethics, and
               relations. Liboiron draws on their work in the Civic Laboratory

               not a symptom of capitalism but a violent enactment of colonial

              effects at low doses that are not predicted by effects at higher
              doses. Here, we review two major concepts in EDC studies: low dose
              and nonmonotonicity. Low-dose effects were defined by the National
              Toxicology Program as those that occur in the range of human
              exposures or effects observed at doses below those used for
              traditional toxicological studies. We review the mechanistic data
              for low-dose effects and use a weight-of-evidence approach to
              analyze five examples from the EDC literature. Additionally, we
              explore nonmonotonic dose-response curves, defined as a nonlinear
              relationship between dose and effect where the slope of the curve
              changes sign somewhere within the range of doses examined. We
              provide a detailed discussion of the mechanisms responsible for
              generating these phenomena, plus hundreds of examples from the

              that nonmonotonic responses and low-dose effects are remarkably
              common in studies of natural hormones and EDCs. Whether low doses
              of EDCs influence certain human disorders is no longer conjecture,
              because epidemiological studies show that environmental exposures
              to EDCs are associated with human diseases and disabilities. We
              conclude that when nonmonotonic dose-response curves occur, the
              effects of low doses cannot be predicted by the effects observed
              at high doses. Thus, fundamental changes in chemical testing and

              net primary production (NPP) in ecosystems dominated by different
              types of autotrophs (i.e. oceanic and coastal phytoplankton,
              microphytobenthos, coral reef algae, macroalgae, seagrasses, marsh
              plants, and mangroves). A large fraction (>40\%) of the NPP of
              marine ecosystems is decomposed within the system, except for
              microphytobenthos (decomposition, ∼25\% of NPP). Herbivory tends
              to be highest for microalgae (planktonic and benthic, >40\% of
              NPP) and macroalgae (33.6 ±4.9\% of NPP) and is somewhat less for
              higher plants. Microphytobenthos export on average a much higher
              proportion of their NPP than do other microalgal communities,
              whereas marine macrophytes, except marsh plants, export a
              substantial proportion (24.3–43.5\% on average) of their NPP.
              fraction of NPP stored in sediments is 4-fold greater for higher
              plants (∼10–17\% of NPP) than for algae (0.4–6\% of NPP). On
              average, ∼90\% of the phytoplankton NPP is used to support local
              heterotrophic metabolism (i.e. grazed or decomposed). This
              fraction is even higher in oceanic communities. Mangrove forests,
              and to a lesser extent seagrass meadows and macroalgal beds,
              produce organic carbon well in excess of the ecosystem
              requirements, with excess photosynthetic carbon (i.e. export rate
              plus storage) in these ecosystem representing ∼40\% of NPP.
              Extrapolation of these results to the global ocean identifies
              marine angiosperms, which only contribute 4\% of total ocean NPP,
              as major contributors of the NPP stored (30\% of total ocean
              carbon storage) and subsequently buried in marine sediments.
              Consideration of burial of NPP from marine angiosperms should lead
              to estimates of total burial of marine NPP that exceed current
              estimates by 15–50\%.",

              incentive-based management approaches have been practiced in the
              US federally managed ﬁsheries off Alaska since the mid-1990s. The
              Bering Sea pollock ﬁshery is one such ﬁshery and remains one of
              the world's largest in both value and volume of landings. In 1998,
              with the implementation of the American Fisheries Act (AFA) this
              ﬁshery was converted from a limited access ﬁshery to a
              rationalized ﬁshery in which ﬁshing quota were allocated to
              cooperatives which could transfer quotas, facilitate ﬂeet
              consolidation, and maximize efﬁciency. The changes in efﬁciency
              and productivity growth arising from the change in management
              regime have been the subject of several studies, with a few
              focusing on the large vessels that both catch and process ﬁsh

              approaches to account for the unique decision making process
              characterizing catcherprocessor's production technologies. The
              focus is on sequential decisions regarding what products to
              produce and the factors that inﬂuence productivity once those
              decisions are made, using a multiproduct revenue function. The
              estimation procedure is based on a latent variable econometric

              deals with the mixed distribution nature of the data, a novel
              application to ﬁsheries production modeling. The resulting
              productivity growth estimates are consistent with increasing
              productivity growth since rationalization of the ﬁshery, even in
              light of large decreases in the pollock stock. These ﬁndings
              suggest that rationalizing ﬁshery incentives can help foster
              improvements in economic productivity even during periods of

              investigation described in this report sought an answer to that
              question. Thus began an investigation into whether seaweed
              cultivation could draw down CO2 within the kelp farm and improve

              County, Washington. After acquiring the necessary permits,
              propagating kelp seed, and outplanting sugar kelp (Saccharina

              metrics of seawater chemistry and on a small suite of calcifying
              organisms within the kelp farm. Additionally, the team developed a
              computer model that simulates environmental variables and kelp
              growth, and then integrates the sampling data into an interface
              that graphically depicts the effect of kelp cultivation on
              seawater chemistry. Comb​ined funding from the Paul G. Allen

              >11,000 fisheries worldwide, in which we investigated the causes

              specifications, reverse fisheries collapse. Subsequent scientific
              studies reinforce and challenge these findings, suggesting
              fruitful avenues for future research linking incentive-based

              and are critical for the livelihood of many communities by
              providing food, tourism revenue, and protection from wave surge.
              These magnificent ecosystems are under existential threat from
              anthropogenic climate change. Whereas extensive ecological and
              physiological studies have addressed coral response to
              environmental stress, high-quality reference genome data are
              lacking for many of these species. The latter issue hinders
              efforts to understand the genetic basis of stress resistance and
              to design informed coral conservation strategies. RESULTS: We
              report genome assemblies from 4 key Hawaiian coral species,
              Montipora capitata, Pocillopora acuta, Pocillopora meandrina, and
              Porites compressa. These species, or members of these genera, are
              distributed worldwide and therefore of broad scientific and
              ecological importance. For M. capitata, an initial assembly was
              generated from short-read Illumina and long-read PacBio data,
              which was then scaffolded into 14 putative chromosomes using
              Omni-C sequencing. For P. acuta, P. meandrina, and P. compressa,
              high-quality assemblies were generated using short-read Illumina
              and long-read PacBio data. The P. acuta assembly is from a
              triploid individual, making it the first reference genome of a
              nondiploid coral animal. CONCLUSIONS: These assemblies are
              significant improvements over available data and provide
              invaluable resources for supporting multiomics studies into coral
              biology, not just in Hawai'i but also in other regions, where
              related species exist. The P. acuta assembly provides a platform

              describe a de novo assembly of its genome based on a linked-read
              sequencing approach developed by 10x Genomics. The final draft
              assembly consisted of 27,870 scaffolds with a N50 size of 186 kb
              and contained a fairly complete set (81\%) of metazoan
              benchmarking (BUSCO) genes. Based on haploid assembly size (615
              Mb) and read k-mer profiles, we estimated the genome size to fall
              between 600 and 700 Mb, although the high fraction of repetitive
              sequence introduced considerable uncertainty. Repeat analysis
              indicated that 42\% of the assembly consisted of interspersed,
              mostly unclassified repeats, and almost 3\% tandem repeats. We
              also identified 36,691 protein-coding genes with a median coding
              sequence length of 807 bp, together spanning 7\% of the assembly.
              The high repeat content and heterozygosity of the genome proved a
              challenging scenario for assembly, requiring additional steps to
              merge haplotypes and resulting in a higher than expected

              associated with innate immunity were overrepresented in this
              treatment. ITS2 analyses confirmed that all coral were associated
              with Symbiodinium ‘fitti’ and 16S analyses revealed similar

              further characterized by their origin from two field sites on

              that transcriptome-wide gene expression profiles clearly separated
              by field site first, and symbiont clade second. With 273
              differentially expressed genes (DEGs, 1.3\% of all host
              transcripts), symbiont clade had a measurable effect on host gene
              expression, but the effect of field site proved almost an order of
              magnitude higher (1,957 DEGs, 9.6\%). According to SNP analysis,
              we found moderate evidence for host genetic differentiation
              between field sites (F-ST = 0.046) and among corals harboring
              alternative symbiont clades (F-ST = 0.036), suggesting that
              site-related gene expression differences are likely due to a
              combination of local adaptation and acclimatization to
              environmental factors. The correlation between host gene
              expression and symbiont clade may be due to several factors,
              including host genotype or microhabitat selecting for alternative
              clades, host physiology responding to different symbionts, or
              direct modulation of host gene expression by Symbiodinium.
              However, the magnitude of these effects at the level of
              transcription was unexpectedly small considering the contribution

              trans-generational plasticity and be apparent in egg and sperm
              transcriptome data. Methods Here, we analyzed M. capitata egg and
              sperm transcriptomic data to address three questions: (1) Which
              pathways and functions are actively transcribed in these gametes?
              (2) How does sperm and egg gene expression differ from adult
              tissues? (3) Does gene expression differ between these gametes?
              Results We show that egg and sperm display surprisingly similar
              levels of gene expression and overlapping functional enrichment
              patterns. These results may reflect similar environmental

              suggesting a dependence on parental transcripts. We speculate that
              cell motility and calcium ion binding genes may be involved in

              amphibians. Moreover, the paper provides novel data on the
              biological effects of some of these plasticizers in invertebrates,
              fish and amphibians. Phthalates and BPA have been shown to affect
              reproduction in all studied animal groups, to impair development
              in crustaceans and amphibians and to induce genetic aberrations.
              Molluscs, crustaceans and amphibians appear to be especially
              sensitive to these compounds, and biological effects are observed
              at environmentally relevant exposures in the low ng l−1 to µg l−1
              range. In contrast, most effects in fish (except for disturbance
              in spermatogenesis) occur at higher concentrations. Most
              plasticizers appear to act by interfering with the functioning of
              various hormone systems, but some phthalates have wider pathways
              of disruption. Effect concentrations of plasticizers in laboratory
              experiments coincide with measured environmental concentrations,

              chemicals on some wildlife populations. The most striking gaps in
              our current knowledge on the impacts of plasticizers on wildlife
              are the lack of data for long-term exposures to environmentally
              relevant concentrations and their ecotoxicity when part of complex
              mixtures. Furthermore, the hazard of plasticizers has been
              investigated in annelids, molluscs and arthropods only, and given
              the sensitivity of some invertebrates, effects assessments are
              warranted in other invertebrate phyla.",

              the Earth’s surface but harbour exceptional marine biodiversity
              and provide vital ecosystem services to millions of people living
              nearby. They are currently threatened by global (e.g. climate
              change) and local (e.g. chemical pollution) stressors that
              interact in multiple ways. While global stressors cannot be
              mitigated by local actions alone, local stressors can be reduced
              through ecosystem management. Here, we aimed to systematically
              review experimental studies assessing the toxicity of chemical
              pollutants to tropical reef-building corals to generate accessible
              and usable knowledge and data that can be used to calculate
              measurement endpoints in ecological risk assessment. From the
              quantitative estimates of effects, we determined toxicity
              thresholds as the highest exposures tested at which no
              statistically significant adverse effects were observed, and we
              compared them to regulatory predicted no effect concentrations for
              the protection of marine organisms, to assess whether these
              reference values are indeed protective of corals. Methods The
              evidence was taken from a systematic map of the impacts of
              chemicals arising from human activity on tropical reef-building
              corals published in 2021. All studies in the map database
              corresponding to the knowledge cluster “Evidence on the
              ecotoxicological effects of chemicals on corals” were selected. To
              identify subsequently published literature, the search was updated
              using a subset of the search string used for the systematic map.
              Titles, abstracts and full-texts were screened according to the
              criteria defining the selected cluster of the map. Because the
              eligibility criteria for the systematic review are narrower than
              the criteria used to define the cluster in the systematic map,
              additional screening was performed. Studies included were
              critically appraised and each study was rated as low, unclear,
              medium, or high risk of bias. Data were extracted from the studies
              and synthesised according to a strategy dependent on the type of
              exposure and outcome. Review findings The systematic review
              reports the known effects of chemical exposures on corals from 847
              studies corresponding to 181 articles. A total of 697 studies (161
              articles) were included in the quantitative synthesis and 150
              studies (50 articles) in the narrative synthesis of the findings.
              The quantitative synthesis records the effects of 2706 exposure
              concentrations-durations of 164 chemicals or mixtures of
              chemicals, and identifies 105 toxicity thresholds corresponding to
              56 chemicals or mixtures of chemicals. When toxicity thresholds
              were compared to reference values set for the protection of marine
              organisms by environmental agencies, the reference values appear
              to be protective of corals for all but three chemicals assessed:
              the metal copper and the pesticides diuron and irgarol 1051.
              Conclusions This open-access database of known ecotoxicological
              effects of chemical exposures on corals can assist managers in the
              ecological risk assessment of chemicals, by allowing easy
              determination of various ecotoxicological thresholds. Several
              limitations of the toxicity tests synthesised here were noted (in
              particular the lack of measurement of effective concentrations for
              more than half of the studies). Overall, most of the currently
              available data on coral toxicity should be replicated
              independently and extended to corals from less studied
              geographical regions and functional groups.",

              influence the health and sustenance of keystone benthic organisms
              (e.g., coral holobionts). The present study investigated the
              community structure and metabolic potential of microbes inhabiting
              coral reefs located across an extensive area in the central
              Pacific. We found that the taxa present correlated strongly with
              the percent coverage of corals and algae, while community
              metabolic potential correlated best with geographic location.
              These findings are inconsistent with prevailing biogeographic
              models of microbial diversity (e.g., distance decay) and metabolic
              potential (i.e., similar functional profiles regardless of
              phylogenetic variability). Based on these findings, we propose
              that the primary carbon sources determine community structure and
              that local biogeochemistry determines finer-scale metabolic
              function. , Holobionts are species-specific associations between
              macro- and microorganisms. On coral reefs, the benthic coverage of
              coral and algal holobionts varies due to natural and anthropogenic
              forcings. Different benthic macroorganisms are predicted to have
              specific microbiomes. In contrast, local environmental factors are
              predicted to select for specific metabolic pathways in microbes.
              To reconcile these two predictions, we hypothesized that
              adaptation of microbiomes to local conditions is facilitated by
              the horizontal transfer of genes responsible for specific
              metabolic capabilities. To test this hypothesis, microbial
              metagenomes were sequenced from 22 coral reefs at 11 Line Islands
              in the central Pacific that together span a wide range of
              biogeochemical and anthropogenic influences. Consistent with our
              hypothesis, the percent cover of major benthic functional groups
              significantly correlated with particular microbial taxa. Reefs
              with higher coral cover had a coral microbiome with higher
              abundances of Alphaproteobacteria (such as Rhodobacterales and
              Sphingomonadales), whereas microbiomes of algae-dominated reefs
              had higher abundances of Gammaproteobacteria (such as
              Alteromonadales, Pseudomonadales, and Vibrionales),
              Betaproteobacteria, and Bacteriodetes. In contrast to taxa,
              geography was the strongest predictor of microbial community
              metabolism. Microbial communities on reefs with higher nutrient
              availability (e.g., equatorial upwelling zones) were enriched in
              genes involved in nutrient-related metabolisms (e.g., nitrate and
              nitrite ammonification, Ton/Tol transport, etc.). On reefs further
              from the equator, microbes had more genes encoding chlorophyll
              biosynthesis and photosystems I/II. These results support the
              hypothesis that core microbiomes are determined by holobiont
              macroorganisms, and that those core taxa adapt to local conditions
              by selecting for advantageous metabolic genes.",

              This analysis of a single full-sibling family revealed contrasting
              responses between short- (4-h) and long-term (5-day) exposures to
              elevated temperatures. Heat shock proteins were up-regulated only

              However, standard RNAseq methods (e.g., Illumina TruSeq® or
              NEBNext®) can be cost prohibitive, especially when study designs
              require large sample sizes. Consequently, RNAseq is often
              underused as a method, or is applied to small sample sizes that
              confer poor statistical power. Low cost RNAseq methods could
              therefore enable far greater and more powerful applications of
              transcriptomics in ecological genetics and beyond. Standard
              mRNAseq is costly partly because one sequences portions of the
              full length of all transcripts. Such whole-mRNA data are redundant
              for estimates of relative gene expression. TagSeq is an
              alternative method that focuses sequencing effort on mRNAs’ 3’

              We found that TagSeq measured the control RNA distribution more
              accurately than NEBNext®, for a fraction of the cost per sample (
              10\%). The higher accuracy of TagSeq was particularly apparent for
              transcripts of moderate to low abundance. Technical replicates of
              TagSeq libraries are highly correlated, and were correlated with
              NEBNext® results. Overall, we show that our modified TagSeq

              during early life stages and how it contributes to developmental

              We applied physiological (metabolism and symbiont density) and
              multi-omic (metabolomics, transcriptomics, and microbial amplicon
              sequencing) approaches over 13 time points (1-255 hours

              metabolism shifted from using stored reserves to relying on

              nutritional exchange, including organic compound transport,
              glucose and fatty acid metabolism, nitrogen metabolism, and
              reactive oxygen regulation were enriched in larvae. Recruits
              expanded utilization of carbohydrate and lipid pathways in
              response to the energetic demands of settlement and calcification.
              Our study shows that symbiotic nutritional exchange buffers the
              energetic demands of development in vertically transmitting
              corals, suggesting that in environmentally stressful conditions,

              been shown to defend against potential pathogens, provide
              essential nutrients, interact with the host’s immune system, and
              even regulate mood. However, it can be difficult to preserve and
              obtain nucleic acids from some host-associated microbiomes, making
              studying their microbial communities challenging. Corals are an
              example of this, in part due to their potentially remote,
              underwater locations, their thick surface mucopolysaccharide
              layer, and various inherent molecular inhibitors. This study
              examined three different preservatives (RNAlater, DNA/RNA Shield,
              and liquid nitrogen) and two extraction methods (the Qiagen
              PowerBiofilm kit and the Promega Maxwell RBC kit with
              modifications) to determine if there was an optimum combination
              for examining the coral microbiome. These methods were employed
              across taxonomically diverse coral species, including
              deep-sea/shallow, stony/soft, and zooxanthellate/azooxanthellate:
              Lophelia pertusa, Paragorgia johnsoni, Montastraea cavernosa,

              subtle differences in microbial communities are attributed to
              dissimilar methodologies. Additionally, the inclusion of internal

              replaced by biologically depauperate alternate stable states
              dominated by turfing algae. Hysteresis maintains algal turfs by
              inhibiting kelp recruitment, preventing the reestablishment of
              kelp forests. The mechanisms inhibiting kelp recruitment remain
              poorly understood as microscopic stages of kelp are difficult to
              study in situ. A potential mechanism contributing to the
              suppression of recruitment may be turf-facilitated grazing of kelp
              gametophytes, the haploid free-living reproductive life stage.
              Here we assess the resilience of kelp gametophytes to grazing
              pressure from a gastropod micrograzer commonly present in turf
              under current and future ocean warming scenarios. Gametophyte
              coverage and abundance were significantly reduced following
              grazing under all temperatures, however there was no significant
              effect of temperature on grazing rates. Once grazing pressure was
              removed, gametophyte abundance recovered to control levels, but
              the total coverage and length of gametophytes continued to decline
              in all treatments. Gametophytes were found to survive micrograzer
              ingestion and continued to grow in aggregations in the gastropod’s
              mucus trail and faeces, even producing sporophytes. Gametophyte
              survival post-ingestion may positively contribute to dispersal and
              sporophyte recruitment, however the lack of gametophyte recovery
              at elevated temperatures may counteract this effect under future
              ocean warming. Taken together, this study demonstrates complex
              interactions that take place in the turf micro-habitat of kelp

              intra-organellar compartmentalization is the pyrenoid in the

              enhances the photosynthetic CO2-fixing activity of the
              Calvin-Benson cycle enzyme Rubisco, suppresses an energetically
              wasteful oxygenase activity of Rubisco, and mitigates limiting CO2
              availability in aquatic environments. Hence, the pyrenoid is
              functionally analogous to the carboxysomes in cyanobacteria.
              However, a comprehensive analysis of pyrenoid functions based on
              its protein composition is lacking. Here we report a proteomic
              characterization of the pyrenoid in the green alga Chlamydomonas

              This pyrenoid proteome contains 190 proteins, many of which
              function in processes that are known or proposed to occur in
              pyrenoids: e.g. the carbon concentrating mechanism, starch
              metabolism or RNA metabolism and translation. Using radioisotope
              pulse labeling experiments, we show that pyrenoid-associated
              ribosomes could be engaged in the localized synthesis of the large
              subunit of Rubisco. New pyrenoid functions are supported by
              proteins in tetrapyrrole and chlorophyll synthesis, carotenoid

              the long-standing hypothesis that the pyrenoid is a hub for
              metabolism. The 81 proteins of unknown function reveal candidates
              for new participants in these processes. Our results provide
              biochemical evidence of pyrenoid functions and a resource for

              species of crustose coralline algae (Lithophyllum impressum and
              Pseudolithophyllum whidbeyense) in the San Juan Islands of
              Washington State, we documented a reversal in competitive
              dominance that occurs at about the +1 m level; L. impressum wins
              in upper zones and P. whidbeyense in lower zones. Regardless of
              tidepool elevation or species, thicker crusts overgrow thinner
              ones and crusts of equal thickness are competitively equal. Both
              crust species are grazed by limpets (primarily Lottia pelta and
              Tectura scutum), which are the dominant herbivores in tidepools.
              Laboratory experiments show that limpet grazing can reduce crust
              thickness. Laboratory and field analyses of limpet grazing
              indicate that corallines in tidepools in the upper intertidal zone
              are subject to high frequency (bite rate per unit area) and low
              intensity (penetration depth per bite) limpet grazing, whereas
              those in low tidepools are subjected to opposite grazing
              characteristics. L. impressum is a thick crust, which has a
              multicellular covering over its meristem. This covering protects
              the growing portion of the plant from the frequent, low—intensity
              herbivory that occurs in the higher tidepools. In contrast, P.
              whidbeyense lacks a multilayered epithallus and is more
              susceptible to injury in high tidepools. In low pools, meristems
              of both crusts are injured. L. impressum heals these deep wounds
              by regenerating vertically, but the net result is a thinner plant
              that is easily overgrown. P. whidbeyense dominates the low zone
              because it is capable of much more rapid lateral growth including

              frequency and intensity of disturbance in their environment. It is
              evident that herbivory is important in this system, not by the
              traditional mechanism of releasing limiting resources (e.g.,
              primary space), but by mediating competitive abilities through the
              relative susceptibility to, and recovery from, herbivory—induced
              disturbance.",

              microplastic exposure is still under debate. Filter feeders like
              bivalves are commonly exposed to microplastics in water and
              sediments and thus can serve as excellent biological indicators
              for microplastic pollution. A relatively rich toxicological
              literature has been focusing on microplastic effects on bivalves
              but we have yet to reach an agreement on the toxic effects and
              mechanisms of microplastics. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis
              and bibliometrics analysis of the microplastic studies in
              bivalves. The bibliometric analysis (used to evaluate the general
              research trends) showed that the investigation of microplastic
              distribution in the marine environment and the molecular
              mechanisms of microplastic toxicity are the two major hot spots of
              research. Based on analyses of ecologically and environmentally
              relevant microplastics concentrations, particle sizes and polymer
              types, we discuss the physiological effects of microplastics on
              bivalves, and the severity and direction of the effects at the
              cellular, tissue, organ and organismal levels. The meta-analysis
              results show that microplastics can induce time-dependent
              oxidative stress in bivalves. Generally, the activities of
              antioxidant enzymes, such as glutathione peroxidase (GPx),
              glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and superoxide dismutase (SOD)
              increased during short-term exposure but declined after long-term
              exposure to microplastics. Non-linear response of GPx, GST and SOD
              enzymes to MP exposure over time indicate that these enzymes are
              not good biomarkers of MPs effects in marine bivalves. The tissue
              glutathione levels and catalase (CAT activity) showed an increase
              during both short- and long term MP exposures and thus can be used

              cooler, mid‐latitude Orpheus Island, where all corals hosted a
              heat‐sensitive clade C Symbiodinium, and warmer, low‐latitude
              Wilkie Island, where corals hosted either a clade C or a more

              garden to reveal differences in baseline gene expression,
              reflecting prior adaptation/long‐term acclimatization. Modelbased
              analysis identified gene expression differences between Wilkie and
              Orpheus corals that were negatively correlated with previously
              described transcriptome‐wide signatures of heat stress, signifying
              generally elevated thermotolerance of Wilkie corals. Yet,
              model‐free analyses of gene expression revealed that Wilkie corals
              hosting clade C were distinct from Wilkie corals hosting clade D,
              whereas Orpheus corals were more variable. Wilkie corals hosting
              clade C symbionts exhibited unique functional signatures,

              species ( Porites compressa , Porites lobata , Montipora capitata
              , and Pocillopora acuta ) over 22-month mesocosm experiment. The
              corals were exposed to one of four treatments: control, ocean
              acidification, ocean warming, or combined future ocean conditions.
              Over the 22-month study, 33–67\% of corals died or experienced a
              loss of most live tissue coverage in the ocean warming and future
              ocean treatments while only 0–10\% died in the ocean acidification
              and control. Among the survivors, coral-associated microbial
              communities responded to the chronic future ocean treatment in one
              of two ways: (1) microbial communities differed between the
              control and future ocean treatment, suggesting the potential
              capacity for acclimatization, or (2) microbial communities did not
              significantly differ between the control and future ocean
              treatment. The first strategy was observed in both Porites species
              and was associated with higher survivorship compared to M .
              capitata and P . acuta which exhibited the second strategy.
              Interestingly, the microbial community responses to chronic
              stressors were independent of coral physiology. These findings
              indicate acclimatization of microbial communities may confer
              resilience in some species of corals to chronic warming associated
              with climate change. However, M . capitata genets that survived
              the future ocean treatment hosted significantly different
              microbial communities from those that died, suggesting the
              microbial communities of the survivors conferred some resilience.
              Thus, even among coral species with inflexible microbial
              communities, some individuals may already be tolerant to future
              ocean conditions. These findings suggest that coral-associated

              understanding needed to contribute to meaningful conservation
              outcomes. Here, we have focused on five aspects of scale:
              biological, spatial, temporal, allometric and phylogenetic. We
              also considered the scale of policy and policy application
              relevant to those five types of scale as well as the merits of
              upscaling and downscaling to explore and address conservation
              problems. Although relevant to all systems (e.g. freshwater,

              is essential to consider scale of all sorts and to work across
              scales to the greatest extent possible. Moreover, given that the
              scales in biological processes will often not match policy and
              management scales, conservation physiology needs to show how it is
              relevant to aspects at different policy/management scales, change

              conservation physiology has much to offer policy makers because of

              molecules. Physiologists must determine if and how the physiology

              communities of microorganisms. These animal microbiotas often play
              important roles in normal physiological function and
              susceptibility to disease; predicting their responses to
              perturbation represents an essential challenge for microbiology.
              Most studies of microbiome dynamics test for patterns in which
              perturbation shifts animal microbiomes from a healthy to a
              dysbiotic stable state. Here, we consider a complementary
              alternative: that the microbiological changes induced by many
              perturbations are stochastic, and therefore lead to transitions
              from stable to unstable community states. The result is an ‘Anna
              Karenina principle’ for animal microbiomes, in which dysbiotic
              individuals vary more in microbial community composition than
              healthy individuals—paralleling Leo Tolstoy's dictum that “all
              happy families look alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its
              own way”. We argue that Anna Karenina effects are a common and
              important response of animal microbiomes to stressors that reduce
              the ability of the host or its microbiome to regulate community
              composition. Patterns consistent with Anna Karenina effects have
              been found in systems ranging from the surface of threatened
              corals exposed to above-average temperatures, to the lungs of
              patients suffering from HIV/AIDs. However, despite their apparent
              ubiquity, these patterns are easily missed or discarded by some
              common workflows, and therefore probably underreported. Now that a
              substantial body of research has established the existence of
              these patterns in diverse systems, rigorous testing, intensive
              time-series datasets and improved stochastic modelling will help
              to explore their importance for topics ranging from personalized
              medicine to theories of the evolution of host–microorganism

              enormously from a complete and reliable holobiont gene expression
              profiling. The most efficient way to acquire holobiont
              transcriptomes is to perform RNA-Seq on both host and symbionts
              simultaneously. However, optimal methods for capturing both host
              and symbiont mRNAs are still under development, particularly when
              the host is a eukaryote and the symbionts are bacteria or archaea.
              Traditionally, poly(A)-enriched libraries have been used to
              capture eukaryotic mRNA, but the ability of this method to
              adequately capture bacterial mRNAs is unclear because of the short
              half-life of the bacterial transcripts. Here, we address this gap
              in knowledge with the aim of helping others to choose an
              appropriate RNA-Seq approach for analysis of animal host-bacterial
              symbiont transcriptomes. Specifically, we compared transcriptome
              bias, depth and coverage achieved by two different mRNA capture
              and sequencing strategies applied to the marine demosponge
              Amphimedon queenslandica holobiont. Annotated genomes of the
              sponge host and the three most abundant bacterial symbionts, which
              can comprise up to 95\% of the adult microbiome, are available.
              Importantly, this allows for transcriptomes to be accurately
              mapped to these genomes, and thus quantitatively assessed and
              compared. The two strategies that we compare here are (i) poly(A)
              captured mRNA-Seq (Poly(A)-RNA-Seq) and (ii) ribosomal RNA
              depleted RNA-Seq (rRNA-depleted-RNA-Seq). For the host sponge, we
              find no significant difference in transcriptomes generated by the
              two different mRNA capture methods. However, for the symbiont
              transcriptomes, we confirm the expectation that the
              rRNA-depleted-RNA-Seq performs much better than the
              Poly(A)-RNA-Seq. This comparison demonstrates that RNA-Seq by
              ribosomal RNA depletion is an effective and reliable method to
              simultaneously capture gene expression in host and symbionts and
              thus to analyse holobiont transcriptomes.",

              Very little direct evidence has been presented to date verifying
              that these processes are active within tropical corals. Here we
              use a combination of stable isotope techniques, nutrient uptake

              nitrogen cycling processes in a selection of tropical
              scleractinian corals. Denitrification activity was detected in all
              species, albeit with very low rates, signifying limited importance
              in holobiont N removal. Relatively greater nitrogen fixation
              activity confirms that corals are net N importers to reef systems.
              Low net nitrification activity suggests limited N regeneration

              O2, scalar irradiance and variable chlorophyll fluorescence, we
              could characterize the physical and chemical microenvironment
              experienced by the symbionts and, for the first time, estimate
              effective quantum yields of PSII photochemistry and rates of
              electron transport at the position of the zooxanthellae corrected
              for the in-tissue gradient of scalar irradiance. The oral- and
              aboral Symbiodinium layers received ∼71\% and ∼33\% of surface
              scalar irradiance, respectively, and the two symbiont layers
              experience considerable differences in light exposure. Rates of
              gross photosynthesis did not differ markedly between the oral- and
              aboral layer and curves of PSII electron transport rates corrected
              for scalar irradiance in hospite, showed that the light use
              efficiency under sub-saturating light conditions were similar
              between the two layers. However, the aboral Symbiodinium band did
              not experience photosynthetic saturation, even at the highest
              investigated irradiance where the oral layer was clearly
              saturated. We thus found a different light acclimation response
              for the oral and aboral symbiont bands in hospite, and discuss
              whether such response could be shaped by spectral shifts caused by
              tissue gradients of scalar irradiance. Based on our experimental
              finding, combined with previous knowledge, we present a conceptual
              model on the photophysiology of Symbiodinium residing inside
              living coral tissue under natural gradients of light and chemical

              listed as threatened under the California Endangered Species Act.
              The reasons for this decline are multiple and complex, including
              the impacts of contaminants. Because the spawning and rearing
              seasons of Longfin Smelt coincide with the rainy season, during
              which concentrations of contaminants increase due to runoff, we
              hypothesized that early life stages may be particularly affected
              by those contaminants. Bifenthrin, a pyrethroid insecticide
              commonly used in agricultural and urban sectors, is of concern.
              Concentrations measured in the Bay-Delta have been shown to

              physical changes in the environment; however, the integration of
              biological clocks in symbiotic systems has received limited
              attention. In corals, the interpretation of rhythmic behaviours is
              complicated by the daily oscillations in tissue oxygen tension
              resulting from the photosynthetic and respiratory activities of
              the associated algal endosymbiont Symbiodinium. In order to better
              understand the integration of biological clocks in cnidarian hosts
              of Symbiodinium, daily rhythms of behaviour and gene expression
              were studied in symbiotic and aposymbiotic morphs of the
              sea-anemone Aiptasia diaphana. Results: The results showed that
              whereas circatidal (approx. 12-h) cycles of activity and gene
              expression predominated in aposymbiotic morphs, circadian (approx.
              24-h) patterns were the more common in symbiotic morphs, where the
              expression of a significant number of genes shifted from a 12-to
              24-h rhythm. The behavioural experiments on symbiotic A. diaphana
              displayed diel (24-h) rhythmicity in body and tentacle contraction
              under the light/dark cycles, whereas aposymbiotic morphs showed
              approximately 12-h (circatidal) rhythmicity. Reinfection
              experiments represent an important step in understanding the
              hierarchy of endogenous clocks in symbiotic associations, where
              the aposymbiotic Aiptasia morphs returned to a 24-h behavioural
              rhythm after repopulation with algae. Conclusion: Whilst some
              modification of host metabolism is to be expected, the extent to
              which the presence of the algae modified host endogenous
              behavioural and transcriptional rhythms implies that it is the
              symbionts that influence the pace. Our results clearly demonstrate

              differ substantially, whereas the ultrastructural surface

              symbiosis between corals and their dinoflagellate symbionts.
              Crucially, metabolic interactions between the two partners support
              coral metabolism and survival, although these can be influenced by
              symbiont identity and inter-partner compatibility. Here, we
              measured how symbiont identity influences the release of biogenic
              volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) via the symbiosis, and related
              this to concurrent shifts in the host microbiome; BVOCs are
              end-products of metabolism and important biological signal
              molecules. We used the sea anemone Aiptasia, a model system for
              cnidarian-dinoflagellate symbiosis, when either symbiont-free,
              populated with its native symbiont, or populated with a non-native
              symbiont. We detected 142 BVOCs across all treatments. The
              volatile profiles of symbiont-free anemones and those containing
              the native symbiont were distinct, while the volatile profile of
              anemones containing the non-native symbiont shared characteristics
              with both. The symbiotic state also caused a change in the host
              microbiome, but this did not explain the changes seen in BVOC
              release. These findings contribute to our understanding of how
              corals may respond to climate change should they acquire novel
              symbionts post-bleaching. Furthermore, we provide a platform for
              future studies of the metabolic and/or signalling roles of BVOCs
              in this important symbiosis. The symbiosis between cnidarians and
              dinoflagellates underpins the success of reef-building corals in
              otherwise nutrient-poor habitats. Alterations to symbiotic state
              can perturb metabolic homeostasis and thus alter the release of
              biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs). While BVOCs can play
              important roles in metabolic regulation and signalling, how the
              symbiotic state affects BVOC output remains unexplored. We
              therefore characterised the suite of BVOCs that comprise the
              volatilome of the sea anemone Exaiptasia diaphana ('Aiptasia')
              when aposymbiotic and in symbiosis with either its native
              dinoflagellate symbiont Breviolum minutum or the non-native
              symbiont Durusdinium trenchii. In parallel, the bacterial
              community structure in these different symbiotic states was fully
              characterised to resolve the holobiont microbiome. Based on rRNA
              analyses, 147 unique amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) were
              observed across symbiotic states. Furthermore, the microbiomes
              were distinct across the different symbiotic states: bacteria in
              the family Vibrionaceae were the most abundant in aposymbiotic
              anemones; those in the family Crocinitomicaceae were the most
              abundant in anemones symbiotic with D. trenchii; and anemones
              symbiotic with B. minutum had the highest proportion of
              low-abundance ASVs. Across these different holobionts, 142 BVOCs
              were detected and classified into 17 groups based on their
              chemical structure, with BVOCs containing multiple functional
              groups being the most abundant. Isoprene was detected in higher
              abundance when anemones hosted their native symbiont, and dimethyl
              sulphide was detected in higher abundance in the volatilome of
              both Aiptasia-Symbiodiniaceae combinations relative to
              aposymbiotic anemones. The volatilomes of aposymbiotic anemones
              and anemones symbiotic with B. minutum were distinct, while the
              volatilome of anemones symbiotic with D. trenchii overlapped both

              bacterial associates have long been overlooked, research on these
              microorganisms is gaining traction, and deciphering bacterial
              identity and function is greatly enhancing our understanding of
              cnidarian biology. Here, we investigated bacterial communities in
              defensive tissues (acontia) of the coral model, the sea anemone
              Exaiptasia diaphana. Acontia are internal filaments that are
              ejected upon detection of an external threat and release toxins to
              repel predators. Results Using culturing techniques and 16S rRNA
              gene metabarcoding we identified bacterial communities associated
              with acontia of four Great Barrier Reef-sourced E. diaphana
              genotypes. We show that bacterial communities are similar across
              genotypes, and dominated by Alteromonadaceae, Vibrionaceae,
              Rhodobacteraceae, and Saprospiraceae. By analyzing abundant
              amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) from metabarcoding data from
              acontia and comparing these to data from whole anemones, we
              identified five potentially important bacterial genera of the
              acontia microbiome: Vibrio, Sulfitobacter, Marivita, Alteromonas,
              and Lewinella. The role of these bacteria within the acontia
              remains uninvestigated but could entail assistance in defense
              processes such as toxin production. Conclusions This study
              provides insight into potential bacterial involvement in cnidarian
              defense tissues and highlights the need to study bacterial
              communities in individual compartments within a holobiont.",

              anemone Exaiptasia diaphana (Aiptasia) to short-term thermal
              elevation. Through 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we characterized the
              microbiomes of symbiotic (with algal symbionts) and aposymbiotic
              (bleached) anemones under ambient (27 degrees C) and heat-stressed
              (34 degrees C) conditions for 8-10 days, using both replicated
              endpoint and non-replicated time-course approaches. Consistent
              with prior studies, we observed a stable abundance of bacteria
              from the families Alteromonadaceae and Rhodobacteraceae, though
              with wide variation among individual anemones. We observed that
              symbiotic state conferred a larger impact on the microbiome than
              heat stress, implying the microbiome may play a metabolic role in
              the maintenance of cnidarian-dinoflagellate symbiosis. In
              particular, Pelobacter, an anaerobic sulfate reducer that is also
              a potential nitrogen fixer, was present only in symbiotic
              anemones, and its abundance decreased with initial exposure to 34
              degrees C, but recovered after 7 days. In aposymbiotic anemones,
              the added heat stress appeared to result in a large increase of
              rare bacterial taxa, which included potential pathogens such as
              Vibrio following bleaching. We also observed several archaea, the
              first reported for this model, but only in the seawater
              surrounding aposymbiotic Aiptasia, where abundance increased
              dramatically following heat stress. We further explored the
              diazotrophic (nitrogen fixation) potential of diverse bacteria
              associated with symbiotic and aposymbiotic Aiptasia, under both
              ambient and heat-stressed conditions, using nifH-PCR and qPCR and
              the acetylene reduction assay (ARA). In contrast to some stony
              corals, nifH was barely expressed in both anemone types, and under
              ambient conditions, diazotrophic activity was not detectable via
              ARA. Thus, although this research contributes to the growing
              knowledge of the bacterial community associated with a prominent
              model used in coral-symbiosis research, our results also suggest
              using caution when making direct comparisons between Aiptasia and
              different coral species in microbiome studies.",

              to elucidate corals' biological characteristics, including their
              thermal tolerance and microbial symbioses. The sea anemone,
              Exaiptasia diaphana, has proven an ideal coral model for many
              studies due to its close phylogenetic relationship and shared
              traits, such as symbiosis with algae of the family
              Symbiodiniaceae. However, established E. diaphana clonal lines are
              not available in Australia thus limiting the ability of Australian
              scientists to conduct research with this model. To help address
              this, the bacterial and Symbiodiniaceae associates of four Great
              Barrier Reef (GBR)-sourced E. diaphana genotypes established in
              laboratory aquaria and designated AIMS1-4, and from proxies of
              wild GBR E. diaphana were identified by metabarcoding of the
              bacterial 16S rRNA gene and eukaryotic rRNA gene ITS2 region. The
              relationship between AIMS1-4 and their bacterial associates was
              investigated, as was bacterial community phenotypic potential.
              Existing data from two existing anemone clonal lines, CC7 and H2,
              were included for comparison. Results Overall, 2238 bacterial
              amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) were observed in the AIMS1-4
              bacterial communities, which were dominated by Proteobacteria and
              Bacteroidetes, together comprising > 90\% relative abundance.
              Although many low abundance bacterial taxa varied between the
              anemone genotypes, the AIMS1-4 communities did not differ
              significantly. A significant tank effect was identified,
              indicating an environmental effect on the microbial communities.
              Bacterial community richness was lower in all lab-maintained E.
              diaphana compared to the wild proxies, suggesting a reduction in
              bacterial diversity and community phenotypic potential due to
              culturing. Seventeen ASVs were common to every GBR lab-cultured
              anemone, however five were associated with the Artemia feedstock,
              making their specific association to E. diaphana uncertain. The
              dominant Symbiodiniaceae symbiont in all GBR anemones was
              Breviolum minutum. Conclusion Despite differences in the presence
              and abundance of low abundance taxa, the bacterial communities of
              GBR-sourced lab-cultured E. diaphana are generally uniform and

              However, only a few studies have focused on plastic additives.
              These chemicals are incorporated into plastics from which they can
              leach out as most of them are not chemically bound. As a
              consequence of plastic accumulation and fragmentation in oceans,
              plastic additives could represent an increasing ecotoxicological
              risk for marine organisms. The present work reviewed the main
              class of plastic additives identified in the literature, their
              occurrence in the marine environment, as well as their effects on

              worldwide attention due to their wide distribution and difficulty
              in handling. Aging processes such as UV irradiation,
              biodegradation, physical abrasion and chemical oxidation can
              affect the environmental behavior of MPs. This review article
              summarizes different aging processes of MPs and subsequent effects
              on the adsorption of pollutants, the leaching of additives, and
              the toxicity of MPs. In addition, the formation process of biofilm
              on the surface of MPs and the interactions between biofilm and
              aged MPs are revealed. MPs can accumulate different environmental
              pollutants (organic pollutants, heavy metals, microorganisms,
              etc.) through surface adsorption, pore filling and distribution.
              Moreover, the aging of MPs affects their adsorption performance
              toward these pollutants due to a series of changes in their
              specific surface area and oxygen-containing functional groups. The
              release of some toxic additives such as phthalates after aging can
              enhance the toxic effects of MPs. Aging also changes the shape and
              size of MPs, which can affect the eating habits of the organisms
              and further increase the potential toxicity of MPs. This article
              conducts a systematical analysis and summary of the environmental
              behavior and physicochemical properties of MPs as well as the
              changes due to MPs aging, which helps to better understand the

              areas facilitates a better understanding of biochemical processes
              in the water column. In February 2020, water samples were
              collected to characterize the distribution and optical properties
              of DOM from the Northern Andaman Sea and the Northeastern Bay of
              Bengal. A high dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration
              appeared in the Northern Andaman Sea, which is strongly affected
              by the DOM contents of the Irrawaddy and Salween Rivers. A barrier
              layer that resulted from the freshwater input was observed above
              the thermocline. This layer was believed to have had a consistent
              effect on the concentration of DOM in the surface water and
              contributed to the differences in DOC concentration on each side

              respectively) and one protein-like component (C3 with maximal
              Ex/Em at 275/334 nm and represented as peak T). The humic-like
              components were mainly derived from terrestrial inputs. Low levels
              of humic-like components were confined in the upper water, with
              strong photodegradation in the euphotic zone. C3 was a typical
              tryptophan-like component that represented freshly produced
              autochthonous DOM. The correlation between C3 and biological index
              and apparent oxygen utilization suggested that it was highly
              bioavailable and not easy to be preserved in the deep sea.
              Overall, our results showed the distributions of DOM in the
              Northern Andaman Sea and the Northeastern Bay of Bengal and

  abstract  = "Octanol-water partition ratio is the most common way of
               expressing the lipophilicity of a compound, and it is defined as
               the ratio of the concentration of a solute in a water-saturated
               octanolic phase to its concentration in an octanol-saturated
               aqueous phase. In the early stage of the drug discovery process,
               lipophilicity is often ranked as one of the most important
               physicochemical properties to screen lead compounds, and it is
               also widely used in environmental risk assessment and
               agricultural fields. In addition, the correlation between
               lipophilicity and biological activity has provoked the extensive
               use of the octanol-water partition ratio, among others, as a
               descriptor in quantitative structure-activity/property
               relationships. In fact, it is contained in thousands of equations
               related to the behavior of biological systems. Therefore, many
               different experimental methods have been developed to determine
               octanol-water partition ratio. Some of them are direct methods,
               such as the shake-flask or the potentiometric methods, and other
               imply indirect measurements, like the chromatographic ones.
               Although it is time-consuming, the shake-flask method is
               considered the reference one. In general, there is good agreement
               between methodologies (especially between shake-flask and
               potentiometry), but each method offers its own advantages and
               drawbacks, and each one must be selected according to compounds’
               chemical properties. This chapter reviews the most important
               methods for octanol-water partition ratio determination and also
               describes its role in biological activity/properties estimation.",

              considered heterotypic synonyms thereof: P. antillarum, P.

              Also, while molecular analysis using ITS sequence data has
              suggested that P. onkodes and P. pachydermum are distinct species,
              the complex and unpredictable evolutionary behaviour of ITS reduce

              that the reason for this is human production activities. The
              global annual production of phthalic esters is estimated at 4.9
              million tons. It is believed that part of this amount enters into
              the environment as a harmful industrial pollutant and has an
              adverse effect on the health of the human population. However,
              from a large number of publications it is clear that phthalates,
              as natural metabolites, are also produced in living nature:
              bacteria, algae, fungi, plants and other organisms. Dibutyl
              phthalate and di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate are the main ingredients
              among natural phthalic acid metabolites. The green cover of the
              planet simultaneously contains these substances many times more
              than their annual industrial production. The unicellate
              inhabitants of the oceans, soils, and other planetary spaces make
              a big contribution to the phthalates entering in the nature. The
              lifetime of phthalates in the environment is short and their
              long-term accumulation is impossible. The observed level of these
              pollutants in the environment is the result of a dynamic
              equilibrium process with the participation of natural biosynthesis
              and industrial production, on the one hand, and biota absorption
              and natural degradation, on the other. The proportion of
              biosynthesis and degradation in this equilibrium is seen to be

              limit the production and use of ortho-phthalic acid esters are of
              little use and make little sense. The observed level is supported
              by constant feeding from wildlife. Throughout human history,
              people have received and are receiving phthalates with plant foods
              without visible consequences. Their harmful effects on the health
              of the human population are exaggerated. And in the process of
              evolution, effective endogenous ways of detoxification have been

              inferential statistics to test the hypothesis of such experiments.
              Thirty years after its appearance, it remains misunderstood by
              many researchers, including ecotoxicologists. In the present
              study, we try to clarify some of its concepts by filling in what
              seems to be a gap in the terminology of manipulative experiments.
              We propose the term “experimental medium” to refer strictly to the
              relevant spatial scale of the experiment to preserve the
              specificity of the experimental and observational units and to
              display pseudoreplication as a kind of misinterpretation and/or
              misanalysis of inferential statistics. A classification of the
              types of experimental designs in ecotoxicology is offered, and the
              problems in using inferential statistics in suboptimal designs are
              discussed. We hope to shed some light on such a classic topic for
              ecotoxicologists. Environ Toxicol Chem 2017;36:2868–2874. © 2017

              reef-building coral species and to compare the severity of both
              stressors. For this, we conducted a series of three controlled
              laboratory experiments and exposed a broad range of coral species
              (Acropora muricata, Montipora digitata, Porites lutea, Pocillopora
              verrucosa, and Stylophora pistillata) to microplastic particles in
              a range of concentrations (2.5–2500 particles L− 1) and mixtures
              (from different industrial sectors) at ambient temperatures and in

              occasionally have both aggravating or mitigating effects on the
              corals’ thermal tolerance. In comparison to heat stress, however,
              microplastic constitutes a minor stressor. While heat stress led
              to decreased photosynthetic efficiency of algal symbionts, and
              increased bleaching, tissue necrosis, and mortality, treatment
              with microplastic particles had only minor effects on the
              physiology and health of the tested coral species at ambient
              temperatures. These findings underline that while efforts to
              reduce plastic pollution should continue, they should not replace
              more urgent efforts to halt global warming, which are immediately
              needed to preserve remaining coral reef ecosystems.",

              induce reproductive disorders that can be inherited by subsequent
              generations. Histone 3 (H3) was significantly (p<0.05) upregulated

              Protection Agency's Toxicity Forecaster and other sources; and 2)
              conduct a comprehensive environmental risk analysis. The results
              show that the mean chemical activities of DEHP and MEHP in abiotic
              environmental samples from locations around the globe are 0.001
              and 10−8, respectively. This indicates that DEHP has reached on
              average 0.1\% of saturation in the abiotic environment. The mean
              chemical activity of DEHP in biological samples is on average
              100-fold lower than that in abiotic samples, likely because of
              biotransformation of DEHP in biota. Biological responses in both
              in vivo and in vitro tests occur at chemical activities between
              0.01 to 1 for DEHP and between approximately 10−6 and 10−2 for
              MEHP, suggesting a greater potency of MEHP compared with DEHP.
              Chemical activities of both DEHP and MEHP in biota samples were

  author   = "Wells, Christopher",
  abstract = "Hexacorallians are one of the most conspicuous and dominant
              suspension feeders in temperate and tropical environments. While
              temperate hexacorallians are particularly diverse in the northeast
              Pacific, little work has been done in examining their biology and
              ecology. Within this dissertation, I describe a novel method for
              marking soft-bodied invertebrates such as hexacorallians (Chapter
              1), examine the prey selectivity of the competitively dominant
              anemone Metridium farcimen with DNA metabarcoding (Chapter 2), and
              explore the distribution of the most common hard-bottom
              hexacorallians in the San Juan Archipelago (Chapter 3). In the
              first chapter, I found that both methylene blue and neutral red
              make excellent markers for long-term monitoring of M. farcimen
              with marked individuals identifiable for up to six weeks and seven
              months, respectively. I also found that fluorescein is lethal in
              small dosages to M. farcimen and should not be used as a marker.
              Neutral red could be used for long-term monitoring of growth and
              survival in the field, and in combination with methylene blue
              could be used to mark individuals in distinguishable patterns for
              short-term studies such as examining predator-prey interactions,
              movement of individuals, and recruitment survival. In the second
              chapter, I found that M. farcimen captures a wider variety of prey
              than has been previously described, likely all prey that are large
              enough to detect and that cannot escape. Additionally, comparisons
              between DNA metabarcoding and published results from traditional
              gut sampling techniques showed that many more taxa can be found by
              DNA metabarcoding. Terrestrial prey were surprisingly high in
              abundance within the diet of M. farcimen, likely due to the
              animals living on floating docks. These data highlight the need
              for consideration of space and time in a sampling regime and the
              usefulness of the metabarcoding method in identifying prey within
              the gut of planktivorous animals. In the final chapter, I found
              that depth, light, flow, and substratum slope had significant
              impacts on the distribution of hard-bottom hexacorallians, whereas
              predation pressure and temperature had no detectable effect. Depth
              and light have a strong relationship with algal cover and most
              hexacorallians were conspicuously missing from high algal cover
              surfaces. Additionally, nearly every species increased in density
              with increased flow. These data call attention to the need for
              experimental studies examining the interactions between temperate
              hexacorallians and algae as well the effects of flow on
              distribution of anthozoans.",

              as methylation of CpG dinucleotides. We leveraged the sensitivity

              of symbiosis with the chlorophyte Elliptochloris marina on
              methylation in the sea anemone Anthopleura elegantissima. We first
              validated the approach by comparison of nanopore-derived
              methylation levels with CpG depletion analysis of a published
              transcriptome, finding that high methylation levels are associated
              with CpG depletion as expected. Next, using reads generated
              exclusively from aposymbiotic anemones, a largely complete draft
              genome comprising 243 Mb was assembled. Reads from aposymbiotic
              and symbiotic sea anemones were then mapped to this genome and
              assessed for methylation using the program Nanopolish, which
              detects signal disruptions from base modifications as they pass

              which there was adequate read coverage (approximately 8\% of the
              CpGs in the genome), symbiosis with E. marina was, surprisingly,
              associated with only subtle changes in the host methylome.
              However, we did identify one extended genomic region with
              consistently higher methylation among symbiotic individuals. The

              and sea anemones, and is associated with homeostatic and
              phenotypic changes in the host that could have epigenetic
              underpinnings, such as methylation of CpG dinucleotides. We
              leveraged the sensitivity to base modifications of nanopore
              sequencing to probe the effect of symbiosis with the chlorophyte
              Elliptochloris marina on methylation in the sea anemone
              Anthopleura elegantissima. We first validated the approach by
              comparison of nanopore-derived methylation levels with CpG
              depletion analysis of a published transcriptome, finding that high
              methylation levels are associated with CpG depletion as expected.
              Next, using reads generated exclusively from aposymbiotic
              anemones, a largely complete draft genome comprising 243 Mb was
              assembled. Reads from aposymbiotic and symbiotic sea anemones were
              then mapped to this genome and assessed for methylation using the
              program Nanopolishwhich detects signal disruptions from base
              modifications as they pass through the nanopore. Based on
              assessment of 452,841 CpGs for which there was adequate read
              coverage (approximately 8\% of the CpGs in the genome), symbiosis
              with E. marina was, surprisingly, associated with only subtle
              changes in the host methylome. However, we did identify one
              extended genomic region with consistently higher methylation among
              symbiotic individuals. The region was associated with a DNA
              polymerase zeta that is noted for its role in translesion
              synthesis, which opens interesting questions about the biology of
              this symbiosis. Our study highlights the power and relative

              event and share many similarities in how they were reduced and
              integrated with their host. However, the subsequent evolution of
              the two organelles could hardly be more different: mitochondria
              are a stable fixture of eukaryotic cells that are neither lost nor
              shuffled between lineages, whereas plastid evolution has been a
              complex mix of movement, loss and replacement. Molecular data from
              the past decade have substantially untangled this complex history,
              and we now know that plastids are derived from a single
              endosymbiotic event in the ancestor of glaucophytes, red algae and
              green algae (including plants). The plastids of both red algae and
              green algae were subsequently transferred to other lineages by
              secondary endosymbiosis. Green algal plastids were taken up by
              euglenids and chlorarachniophytes, as well as one small group of
              dinoflagellates. Red algae appear to have been taken up only once,
              giving rise to a diverse group called chromalveolates. Additional
              layers of complexity come from plastid loss, which has happened at
              least once and probably many times, and replacement. Plastid loss
              is difficult to prove, and cryptic, non-photosynthetic plastids
              are being found in many non-photosynthetic lineages. In other
              cases, photosynthetic lineages are now understood to have evolved
              from ancestors with a plastid of different origin, so an ancestral
              plastid has been replaced with a new one. Such replacement has
              taken place in several dinoflagellates (by tertiary endosymbiosis
              with other chromalveolates or serial secondary endosymbiosis with
              a green alga), and apparently also in two rhizarian lineages:
              chlorarachniophytes and Paulinella (which appear to have evolved
              from chromalveolate ancestors). The many twists and turns of
              plastid evolution each represent major evolutionary transitions,
              and each offers a glimpse into how genomes evolve and how cells
              integrate through gene transfers and protein trafficking.",

              heat stress. Although it is known that scleractinian corals can
              ingest microplastic, little is known about their egestion and how
              microplastic exposure may impair corals at physiological and
              cellular levels. In addition, the effects of microplastic
              pollution at current environmental concentration have been little

              heat stress. In this study, the combined effects of these
              environmental threats on Pocillopora damicornis were investigated
              from a physical and cellular perspective. Colonies were exposed to
              three concentrations of polyethylene microplastic beads (no
              microplastic beads: [No MP], 1 mg/L: [Low MP]; 10 mg/L: [High
              MP]), and two different temperatures (25 °C and 30 °C) for 72 h.
              No visual signs of stress in corals, such as abnormal mucus
              production and polyp extroflection, were recorded. At [Low MP],
              beads adhered to colonies were ingested but were also egested.
              Moreover, thermally stressed colonies showed a lower adhesion and
              higher egestion of microplastic beads. Coral bleaching was
              observed with an increase in temperature and microplastic bead
              concentration, as indicated by a general decrease in chlorophyll
              concentration and Symbiodiniaceae density. An increase in lipid
              peroxidation was measured in colonies exposed to [Low MP] and
              [High MP] and an up-regulation of stress response gene hsp70 was
              observed due to the synergistic interaction of both stressors.
              Overall, our findings showed that heat stress still represents the
              main threat to P. damicornis, while the effect of microplastics on
              coral health and physiology may be minor, especially at control
              temperature. However, microplastics could exacerbate the effect of
              thermal stress on cellular homeostasis, even at [Low MP]. While
              reducing ocean warming is critical for preserving coral reefs,
              effective management of emerging threats like microplastic
              pollution is equally essential.",

              the percent change in zoochlorellae density in tentacles of
              anemones held at 20°C was significantly less (in green anemones, -
              69\%) than changes obtained with all other symbiont-temperature
              interactions. Zooxanthellae and zoochlorellae in mixed anemone
              tentacles showed the same population density response to the
              treatments as zooxanthellae and zoochlorellae in brown and green
              anemones, respectively. Population densities of both algal
              symbionts are regulated by temperature and light, and the relative

              different algal symbionts simultaneously: zooxanthellae
              (Symbiodinium muscatinei) and zoochlorellae (green algae;
              Trebouxiophyceae, Chlorophyta). A seasonal comparison of
              zooxanthellate and zoochlorellate anemones showed stable symbiont
              population densities in summer and winter, with densities of
              zoochlorellae about 4 times those of zooxanthellae.
              Photosynthesis-irradiance curves of freshly isolated symbionts
              show that the productivity ($P_{\text{max}}$ cell) of freshly
              isolated zooxanthellae was about 2.5 times that of zoochlorellae
              during July; comparable rates were obtained in other months.
              Models of algal carbon flux show that zoochlorellae may supply the
              host with more photosynthetic carbon per unit anemone biomass than
              zooxanthellae supply. Zooxanthellate anemone tissue was 2‰ (¹³C)

              (¹³C) and 8‰ (¹⁵N) enriched over their respective symbionts,
              suggesting that zoochlorellate anemones receive less nutrition

              short-term measures of algal contributions may not reflect actual
              nutritional inputs to the host. Isotopic data support the
              hypothesis of substantial reliance on external food sources. This
              additional nutrition may allow both algae to persist in this

              associated with these anomalous events, including shifts in

              industries through declines in important fishery species and
              impacts on aquaculture. Extreme temperatures are increasingly seen
              as important influences on biological systems, yet a consistent
              definition of MHWs does not exist. A clear definition will
              facilitate retrospective comparisons between MHWs, enabling the
              synthesis and a mechanistic understanding of the role of MHWs in
              marine ecosystems. Building on research into atmospheric
              heatwaves, we propose both a general and specific definition for
              MHWs, based on a hierarchy of metrics that allow for different
              data sets to be used in identifying MHWs. We generally define a
              MHW as a prolonged discrete anomalously warm water event that can
              be described by its duration, intensity, rate of evolution, and
              spatial extent. Specifically, we consider an anomalously warm
              event to be a MHW if it lasts for five or more days, with
              temperatures warmer than the 90th percentile based on a 30-year
              historical baseline period. This structure provides flexibility
              with regard to the description of MHWs and transparency in
              communicating MHWs to a general audience. The use of these metrics
              is illustrated for three 21st century MHWs; the northern
              Mediterranean event in 2003, the Western Australia ‘Ningaloo Niño’
              in 2011, and the northwest Atlantic event in 2012. We recommend a

              Symbiodinium (zooxanthellae, ZX) and a chlorophyte (zoochlorellae,

              over the other and whether temperature regulates the observed
              distributions of natural populations of ZX and ZC. Temperature
              appears to be a key factor in regulating both the photophysiology
              and metabolism of this algal–cnidarian association. In anemones
              containing ZX, neither algal densities nor chlorophyll content
              varied with temperature (6–24 °C); in contrast, anemones with ZC
              displayed reduced densities and chlorophyll content at the highest
              temperature treatment (24 °C). Both ZX and ZC photosynthetic rates
              were directly related to temperature, as were anemone respiration
              rates. The higher photosynthetic rates, maintenance of a stable
              algal density and chlorophyll content, and higher potential
              contribution of algal carbon toward animal respiration (CZAR)
              suggest that the ZX are the more viable symbiont as temperature
              increases, but we suggest alternative reasons why ZC are preserved
              in this symbiotic association. Elevated temperatures reduce ZC
              densities and chlorophyll, suggesting that higher temperatures
              affect this relationship in a negative fashion, presumably due to
              a higher cost of maintaining ZC by the association; alternatively,
              these costs may be affiliated with the deterioration of the ZC
              themselves. These results suggest that temperature may be one of
              the most significant environmental parameters that sets the

              association with unicellular Dinophyceae. These brown or
              yellow-brown algae, known as zooxanthellae, occur intracellularly
              in the gastrodermal tissues of the host anemone (Muscatine, 1961)
              . ' The influence of these symbiotic algae on the biology of
              Antbopleur« and on other anemones has been studied experimentally.
              The algae fix 14C02 and manufacture reduced organic carbon. Some
              of this carbon is translocated to the host anemone tissue where it
              is used in the synthesis of a wide range of animal constituents.
              In the absence of these algae, starved anemones lose weight faster
              than controls with algae. Thus, the adaptive value of the algae
              seems, in part, to be nutritional (Muscatine and Hand, 1958;
              Muscatine, 1961; Trench, 1968, 1969; Taylor, 1968, 1969). Within

              of pgr5 suppressed qE and accelerated photoinhibition. We found
              that impairment of qE, by mutations of pgr5, npq1, and npq4,
              caused inhibition of the repair of photodamaged PSII at the step

              impairment of CEF, but not impairment of qE, accelerated

              different photoprotection mechanisms: one is linked to qE
              generation and prevents the inhibition of the repair of
              photodamaged PSII at the step of protein synthesis, and the other
              is independent of qE and suppresses photodamage to PSII.",

              widespread requirements in biochemical processes, iron is an

              concentration on thermal sensitivity, the physiological responses
              of cultured symbiotic dinoflagellates (genus Breviolum; family
              Symbiodiniaceae) were evaluated when exposed to increasing
              temperatures (26 to 30°C) and iron concentrations ranging from
              replete (500 pM Fe’) to limiting (50 pM Fe’) under a diurnal light

              reach exponential growth during heat stress (50 pM Fe′ at 26–28°C
              vs. 250 pM Fe′ at 30°C). In treatments where exponential growth
              was reached, Breviolum psygmophilum grew faster than B.minutum,
              possibly due to greater cellular contents of iron and other trace
              metals. The metal composition of B.psygmophilum shifted only at
              the highest temperature (30°C), whereas changes in B.minutum were

              suggests the importance of trace metals to the health of
              coral-algal mutualisms. Ultimately, a greater ability to acquire
              scarce metals may improve the tolerance of corals to physiological

              and spatial point-pattern image analyses to characterize cell
              population distributions in both partners, we developed protocols
              that are tailored to the three-dimensional cellular landscape of a
              symbiotic sea anemone tentacle. Introducing cultured symbiont
              cells to symbiont-free adult hosts increased overall host cell
              proliferation rates. The acceleration occurred predominantly in
              the symbiont-containing gastrodermis near clusters of symbionts

              indicating that the presence of symbionts contributes to elevated

              Symbiont cell cycle progression differed between cultured algae
              and those residing within hosts; the endosymbiotic state resulted
              in increased S-phase but decreased G2/M-phase symbiont

              evidence to support species-specific regulation of the symbiont

              Biomass regulation is critical to the overall health of
              cnidarian-dinoflagellate symbioses. Despite the central role of
              the cell cycle in the growth and proliferation of cnidarian host
              cells and dinoflagellate symbionts, there are few studies that
              have examined the potential for host-symbiont coregulation. This
              study provides evidence for the acceleration of host cell
              proliferation when in local proximity to clusters of symbionts
              within cnidarian tentacles. The findings suggest that symbionts
              augment the cell cycle of not only their enveloping host cells but
              also neighboring cells in the epidermis and gastrodermis. This
              provides a possible mechanism for rapid colonization of cnidarian
              tissues. In addition, the cell cycles of symbionts differed
              depending on nutritional regime, symbiotic state, and species
              identity. The responses of cell cycle profiles to these different
              factors implicate a role for species-specific regulation of
              symbiont cell cycles within host cnidarian tissues.",

              determine if seasonal microparticle concentrations are dependent
              on environmental or tourism variables in Elliott Bay, Salish Sea.
              We sampled 100 L of seawater at a depth of approximately 9 m at
              the Seattle Aquarium, Seattle, Washington State, United States,
              approximately every two weeks from 2019 through 2020 and used an

              microparticle concentrations ranged from 0 to 0.64 particles L−1
              and fibers were the most common type observed. Microparticle
              concentrations exhibited a breakpoint on 10 April 2020, where
              estimated slope and associated microparticle concentration
              significantly declined. Further, when considering both
              environmental as well as tourism variables, temporal microparticle
              concentration was best described by a mixed-effects model, with
              tourism as the fixed effect and the person counting microparticles

              out to identify effects of seasonality and interannual differences
              in microparticle concentrations, it instead captured an effect of
              decreased tourism due to the global Covid-19 pandemic. Long-term
              monitoring is critical to establish temporal microparticle
              concentrations and to help researchers understand if there are

              North Pacific Ocean is a global hotspot for pollution, yet few
              sand lance (1.5\%) or herring (2.0\%) had ingested microfibres. In

              Sampling at a single site (Protection Island, WA) in a single year

              understanding the effects on organisms, ecosystems, and policy",
  author   = "Harris, Lyda",
  address  = "Seattle",
  abstract = "Microplastics (plastic < 5mm) are ubiquitous in marine
              environments, from surface waters to benthic sediments.
              Microplastic in the oceans was first documented in 2004 and our
              current knowledge of potential biological implications is limited
              and rapidly growing. Thus far, we know marine organisms are
              exposed to microplastics in natural settings, ingest
              microplastics, and experience negative physiological impacts. Many
              aspects of microplastics such as ingestion fate, extent of trophic
              transfer, and effect on marine ecosystems remain unknown.
              Motivated by the need to understand the impact microplastic
              pollution has on our environment and our lives, I investigated
              three aspects of the marine microplastic problem: impacts on
              marine organisms, the ecosystem they support, and the linkages
              between scientific research and public policy. In nature, mussels
              experience a wide range of particle types and concentrations,
              readily filtering microalgae and abiotic particles other than
              microplastic. Mussel clearance rate is sensitive to stress, making
              it a good indicator of stressful conditions and polluted
              environments. In Chapter 1, I compare mussel (Mytilus trossulus)
              clearance rates when exposed to two different abiotic particles,
              microplastic and silt, across multiple concentrations. I measure
              the clearance rates of mussels exposed to increasing
              concentrations of three particle treatments: Algae, microplastic +
              algae, and silt + algae. I found that mussel clearance rate was
              inhibited by high concentrations of microplastics but not silt. In
              the absence of microplastic, mussel clearance rate was not
              dependent on the addition of silt, total particle concentration,
              or algal concentration. Mussels readily ingest microplastics in
              natural and laboratory settings, raising concerns about particle
              fate. Mussels are key benthic-pelagic couplers, concentrating
              particles from the water column into dense and nutrient rich
              biodeposits. In Chapter 2, I evaluate how microplastic changes the
              benthic-pelagic coupling role of marine mussels (M. trossulus). I
              expose mussels to feeding regimes with and without microplastic
              and measure four attributes of biodeposits: morphology, quantity
              of algal and microplastic particles, sinking rate, and
              resuspension velocity. I found biodeposits from the algae
              treatment contained more algal cells on average than those from
              the microplastic treatment. Further, biodeposits from the
              microplastic treatment sank slower and resuspended at slower water
              velocities than biodeposits from the algae treatment. To combat
              plastic pollution, there is sufficient evidence that policies can
              lead to reduced plastic production and consumption both locally
              and globally. In Chapter 3, I examine global growth and spread of
              the marine microplastic field in conjunction with growth and
              spread of national plastic policies using scientometric and
              diffusion methods. I conduct systematic literature reviews of
              marine microplastic papers and national plastic policies through
              2019. At a global level, marine microplastic research and national
              plastic policies have grown exponentially and remain in the early
              phases of growth and spatial diffusion. Marine microplastic
              publication spread at the institution level was best explained by
              a hybrid of expansion and relocation diffusion, while national
              plastic policy spread was best explained by expansion diffusion.
              Taken together, findings from Chapters 1 and 2 indicate mussels
              readily filter, ingest, and egest microplastics, demonstrating
              their ability to transport particles between benthic and pelagic
              habitats. When exposed to microplastics, decreased clearance rate
              may result in fewer particles removed from the water column and
              subsequently available to benthic organisms. Further, decreases in
              sinking rate and resuspension velocity of biodeposits containing
              microplastic may increase dispersal distances, thus leading to
              increased transport of both algal cells and microplastic particles
              away from mussel beds. While extent of marine microplastic
              research is not a good indicator of national plastic policies,
              both the scientific field and national efforts to reduce plastic
              pollution are spreading globally at exponential rates. Marine
              microplastic pollution is a local, regional, and global issue that
              require cross disciplinary attention from researchers and policy
              makers around the world.",

              of the intertidal anemone Anthopleura elegantissima and its algal
              symbionts using a laboratory-based tank experiment. High
              intertidal anemones had lower baseline symbiont-to-host cell
              ratios under control conditions, but their symbionts had higher
              baseline maximum quantum yield compared to low intertidal anemone
              symbionts, despite identical symbiont communities. High intertidal
              anemones maintained greater maximum quantum yield and
              symbiont-to-host cell ratios under heat stress compared to low
              intertidal anemones, suggesting that high intertidal holobionts
              have greater thermal tolerance. However, thermal tolerance of
              clonal anemones acclimatized to different zones was not explained
              by tidal height alone, indicating emersion duration is not the

              genotypic effects also influenced physiological baselines, but did
              not modulate thermal tolerance, demonstrating thermal tolerance is
              largely driven by environmental history. These results indicate
              that this symbiosis is highly plastic and may be able to rapidly
              acclimatize to climate change, defying the convention that
              symbiotic organisms are more susceptible to environmental stress.",

              slopes of the RLCs were apparent when plotting ETR versus the
              absorbed irradiance (Ia) (initial slope=0.75±0.01 versus 0.62±0.12
              during the winter and summer, respectively); this is called for

              suggest (a) to present the x-axis of RLCs as Ia (Ii×AF×0.5), and
              ETR on the y-axis as Y×Ia, and (b) that Y0 can be taken as a
              correct measure of the maximal quantum yield instead of estimating

              Notably, these partnerships create the foundation of coral reef
              ecosystems and are at risk of breaking down due to climate change.
              This symbiosis couples the fitness of the partners, where
              adaptations in one species can benefit the holobiont. However, the
              scales over which each partner can match their current-and

              their endosymbiont Breviolum 'muscatinei', across an extensive

              two solitary host species exhibited isolation by distance across

              location to depth in the intertidal zone, and host species,
              suggesting that symbiont populations are more likely than their

              and non-symbiotic (Actinia schmidti) sea anemones show striking

              basal expression of SOD is very different. Symbiotic animal cells
              have a higher isoform diversity (number and classes) and a higher
              activity than the non-symbiotic cells. Second, the symbiotic
              animal cells of A. viridis also maintain unaltered basal values
              for cellular damage when exposed to experimental hyperoxia (100\%
              O(2)) or to experimental thermal stress (elevated temperature +7
              degrees C above ambient). Under such conditions, A. schmidti
              modifies its SOD activity significantly. Electrophoretic patterns
              diversify, global activities diminish and cell damage biomarkers
              increase. These data suggest symbiotic cells adapt to stress while
              non-symbiotic cells remain acutely sensitive. In addition to being
              toxic, high O(2) partial pressure (P(O(2))) may also constitute a
              preconditioning step for symbiotic animal cells, leading to an
              adaptation to the hyperoxic condition and, thus, to oxidative
              stress. Furthermore, in aposymbiotic animal cells of A. viridis,
              repression of some animal SOD isoforms is observed. Meanwhile, in

              the sea anemone Aiptasia pulchella and the scleractinian coral

              the two symbiotic partners may explain such variations in SOD

              loss of Symbiodiniaceae, chlorophyll, or both from zooxanthellate
              animals. To quantify bleaching and recovery, standardised methods
              for quantification of Symbiodiniaceae and chlorophyll
              concentrations have been developed for reef-building scleractinian
              corals, but no such standard method has been developed for
              octocorals. For stony corals, quantification of Symbiodiniaceae
              and chlorophyll concentrations often relies on normalisation to
              skeletal surface area or unit of biomass (i.e. protein, ash-free
              dry weight (AFDW)). Stiff octocorals do not change their volume,
              as such studies have used volume and surface area to standardise
              densities, but soft-bodied octocorals can alter their size using
              water movement within the animal; therefore, Symbiodiniaceae and
              chlorophyll cannot accurately be measured per unit of surface area
              and are instead measured in units of Symbiodiniaceae and
              chlorophyll per µg of host protein or AFDW. Though AFDW is more
              representative of the full biomass composition than host protein,
              AFDW is more time and resource intensive. Here we provide a
              streamlined methodology to quantify Symbiodiniaceae density,
              chlorophyll concentration, and protein content in soft-bodied
              octocorals. This technique uses minimal equipment, does not
              require freeze-drying or burning samples to obtain ash weight, and
              is effective for down to 0.2 grams wet tissue. Bulk samples can be
              centrifuged, the Symbiodiniaceae pellet washed, and the
              supernatant saved for protein analysis. This efficient technique
              allows for clean, easy to count samples of Symbiodiniaceae with
              minimal animal protein contamination. Chlorophyll a and c2
              extractions occurs at different rates, with chlorophyll a taking
              24 hours to extract completely at 4°C and chlorophyll c2 taking 48
              hours. Finally, we found that where necessary, wet weight may be
              used as a proxy for protein content, but the correlation of
              protein and wet weight varies by species and protein should be
              used when possible. Overall, we have created a rapid and accurate
              method for quantification of bleaching markers in octocorals.",

              metabolism of various pesticides and consequently reduced their
              residual levels in cucumber (Cucumis sativus L). Chlorpyrifos, a
              widely used insecticide, caused significant reductions of net
              photosynthetic rate (Pn) and quantum yield of PSII (ΦPSII) in
              cucumber leaves. EBR pretreatment alleviated the declines of Pn
              and ΦPSII caused by chlorpyrifos application, and this effect of
              EBR was associated with reductions of chlorpyrifos residues. To
              understand how EBR promotes chlorpyrifos metabolism, the effects
              of EBR on activity and expression of enzymes involved in pesticide

              enhanced the expression of P450 and MRP, which encode P450

              common cnidarian of the eastern Pacific Ocean: the anemone

              HSP70 (2.5 ng HSP70 μg P-1), than deeper ones (0.1 ng HSP70 μg

              Therefore, when using PAM ﬂuorometry, we suggest (a) to present

              41\% lower maximum relative electron transport rate (rETRmax) and

              Embryos and swimming larvae were exposed to pH treatments of 7.8
              (ambient), 7.6 (low) and 7.3 (extreme low) from fertilization to 9

              stage-specific gene expression were compared between treatments to
              determine the effects of acidified seawater on early development.
              Although there was no measurable size differentiation between pH
              treatments at the fertilized egg and prawn chip (9 h
              post-fertilization) stages, early gastrulae and larvae raised in

              variable exposure to elevated pCO2, which is more ecologically

              OA on embryonic and larval Pacific razor clams (Siliqua patula), a
              bivalve that produces a concretion during early shell development.
              Larvae were spawned and cultured over 28 days under three pCO2
              treatments: a static high pCO2 of 867 μatm, a variable, diel pCO2
              of 357 to 867 μatm, and an ambient pCO2 of 357 μatm. Our results
              indicate that the calcium carbonate polymorphism of the concretion
              phase of S. patula was amorphous calcium carbonate which
              transitioned to vaterite during the advanced D-veliger stage, with
              a final polymorphic shift to aragonite in adults, suggesting an
              increased vulnerability to dissolution under OA. However, exposure
              to elevated pCO2 appeared to accelerate the transition of larval
              S. patula from the concretion stage of shell development to
              complete calcification. There was no significant impact of OA

              of the incident downwelling photosynthetically available radiation

              that the values were always lower in the afternoon than during
              morning hours when measured at similar irradiances. Accordingly,
              the relative photosynthetic electron transport rate (rETR, =
              ΔF/F′m × incident PAR) for those colonies also showed lower values
              in the afternoons than in the mornings at equal irradiances. The
              rETRs also saturated well before maximal midday irradiances
              occurred. At the same time, nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ,
              measured as [Fm - F′m ]/F′m ) was higher in the afternoons than
              during the mornings under similar incident PAR values. These
              results indicate an afternoon loss in photosynthetic capacity from
              photoinhibition. Such photoinhibition was not apparent during the
              course of the day in the corals growing in deeper water. The
              latter also showed no saturation of photosynthesis at the highest
              incident PAR values at noon (which were approximately a third of
              those at the shallower site). In addition, the shallow-growing
              corals showed significantly lower maximum quantum yields (ΔF/F′m
              measured during nighttime, equivalent to Fv/Fm) than the deeper
              growing ones. This is most likely caused by an additional, more
              chronic, photoinhibition in the shallow-growing corals but could
              also be due to some form of photoacclimation or to factors other

              recovery took 4 to 6 h and began to occur as soon as light levels
              fell each day. Chlorophyll fluorescence quenching analysis of
              corals measured during the early afternoon revealed classic
              regulation of photosystem I1 (PSII) efficiency through
              non-photochemical quenching (NPQ).These results appear to be
              similar to data collected for other algae and higher plants,
              suggesting involvement of the xanthophyll cycle of symbiotic
              dinoflagellates in regulating the quantum efficiency of PSII. The
              ability of symbiotic dinoflagellates to develop significant NPQ,
              however, depended strongly on when the symbiotic dinoflagellates
              were studied. Whereas symbiotic dinoflagellates from corals in the
              early afternoon showed a significant capacity to regulate the
              efficiency of PSII using NPQ, those sampled before sunrise had a
              slower and much reduced capacity, suggesting that elements of the
              xanthophyll cycle are suppressed prior to sunrise. A second major
              finding of this study is that the quantum efficiency of PSII in
              symbiotic dinoflagellates is strongly diurnal, and is as much as
              50 \% lower just prior to sunrise than later in the day. When
              combmed with oxygen flux data, these results indicate that a
              greater portion of the electron transport occurring later in the
              day is likely to be due to the increases in the rate of carbon
              fixation by Rubisco or to higher fluxes through the
              MeNer-Ascorbate-Peroxidase (MAP)cycle.",

              must safely harvest sunlight for photosynthesis and dissipate
              excess energy to prevent oxidative stress. Oxidative stress is
              caused by environmental stressors such as those associated with
              global climate change, and ultimately leads to breakdown of the
              coral–algal symbiosis known as coral bleaching. Recently,
              large-scale coral bleaching events have become pervasive and
              frequent threatening and endangering coral reefs. Because the

              using pulse amplitude modulated (PAM) chlorophyll fluorescence

              However, Fv/Fm also drifted downwards at night or in prolonged
              darkness, and increased rapidly during the early morning twilight.
              This parameter also increased when the oxygen concentration of the
              water holding the corals was increased. Such changes have not been
              described previously, and most probably reflect state transitions

              and whole mounts are presented. One apparent difference between
              these two major groups is that before gastrulation the cells of
              the complex corals thus far described (mainly Acropora species)
              spread and flatten to produce the so-called prawn chip, which
              lacks a blastocoel. Our present broad survey of robust and complex
              corals reveals that prawn chip formation is not a synapomorphy of
              complex corals, as Pavona Decussata does not form a prawn chip and
              has a well-developed blastocoel. Although prawn chip formation
              cannot be used to separate the two clades, none of the robust
              corals which we surveyed has such a stage. Many robust coral
              embryos pass through two periods of invagination, separated by a
              return to a spherical shape. However, only the second of these
              periods is associated with endoderm formation. We have therefore
              termed the first invagination a pseudo-blastopore.",

              displayed high phenotypic plasticity, with corals from a
              high-light environment having more wax esters, lighter tissue δ13C

              Despite the broad phenotypic plasticity displayed by adults,
              parental investment in the context of provisioning of energy
              reserves and antioxidant defense was the same in eggs from the

              The egg–sperm bundle is an efficient way of transporting gametes
              to the ocean surface where fertilization takes place, while
              minimizing sperm dilution and maximizing the opportunity for
              gamete encounters during a spawning event. To date, there are few

              longevity of the egg–sperm bundle in Montipora capitata, a major
              reef building coral in Hawai‘i. Our results show that the
              egg–sperm bundle is formed by a mucus layer secreted by the

              gametes in different mesenteries. Once the egg–sperm bundle has

              turbulence). Although the bundle has an ephemeral life span, the
              formation of an egg–sperm bundle is a fundamental part of the
              reproductive process that could be strongly influenced by climate

              the eggs and larvae resulted in irreversible inhibition of
              photosynthesis in endogenous and exogenous zooxanthellae within
              minutes. Moreover, these toxins were stable, as frozen storage of
              eggs and larvae did not affect toxicity. Photosynthetic competency
              of Porites compressa zooxanthellae treated with either frozen or

              sperm suspensions reduced in vitro fertilization success by
              killing the sperm. After 30 min, untreated sperm maintained 90 ±

              delivered almost equally to the blastomeres during cleavage. In P.
              cylindrica, gastrulation occurred via delamination or ingression,
              and blastomeres containing zooxanthellae dropped into the
              blastocoel during gastrulation. Thus, zooxanthellae were
              restricted to the endodermal cells at the gastrula or early
              planula stage in P. cylindrica. In M. digitata, gastrulation
              occurred by a combination of invagination and epiboly to form a
              somewhat concave gastrula. Zooxanthellae were present in both
              endodermal and ectodermal cells of early planulae, but they
              disappeared from the ectoderm as the planulae matured. In our

              zooxanthellae were localized in eggs as well as in embryos, and
              that blastomeres containing zooxanthellae later dropped into the
              blastocoel to become restricted to the endoderm (Hirose et al.,
              2000). The timing and mechanism of zooxanthella localization and
              types of gastrulation differed among species belonging to the

              Embryos and swimming larvae were exposed to pH treatments of 7.8

              at the tissue level of organization, but are surprisingly complex
              and vertebrate-like in terms of gene repertoire. As major
              components of tropical reef ecosystems, the stony corals are
              anthozoans of particular ecological significance. To better
              understand the molecular bases of both cnidarian development in
              general and coral-specific processes such as skeletogenesis and
              symbiont acquisition, microarray analysis was carried out through
              the period of early development - when skeletogenesis is
              initiated, and symbionts are first acquired. RESULTS: Of 5081
              unique peptide coding genes, 1084 were differentially expressed (P
              <or= 0.05) in comparisons between four different stages of coral
              development, spanning key developmental transitions. Genes of
              likely relevance to the processes of settlement, metamorphosis,
              calcification and interaction with symbionts were characterised
              further and their spatial expression patterns investigated using
              whole-mount in situ hybridization. CONCLUSION: This study is the
              first large-scale investigation of developmental gene expression
              for any cnidarian, and has provided candidate genes for key roles
              in many aspects of coral biology, including calcification,
              metamorphosis and symbiont uptake. One surprising finding is that
              some of these genes have clear counterparts in higher animals but
              are not present in the closely-related sea anemone Nematostella.
              Secondly, coral-specific processes (i.e. traits which distinguish
              corals from their close relatives) may be analogous to similar
              processes in distantly related organisms. This first large-scale
              application of microarray analysis demonstrates the potential of
              this approach for investigating many aspects of coral biology,
              including the effects of stress and disease.",

              changes in the distribution pattern of zooxanthellae during
              development. Oocytes of both species took up zooxanthellae 3 to 4
              days before spawning. At first, zooxanthellae were evenly
              distributed in oocytes, but they later moved to the hemisphere
              that contained the germinal vesicle. After fertilization, early
              cleavage events were holoblastic, progressing by furrow formation.
              The first cleavage furrow started at the hemisphere that contained
              zooxanthellae, dividing the zooxanthellate complement of the
              zygote about equally into the two blastomeres. The second division
              divided each blastomere into one zooxanthellae-rich cell and one
              with few zooxanthellae. With continued cell division, blastomeres
              containing zooxanthellae moved into the blastocoel. The blastocoel
              disappeared at about 5 h after the first cleavage, and the central
              region of the embryo was filled with cells containing either
              zooxanthellae or lipid droplets, forming a stereogastrula. Our
              results suggest that only blastomeres that had been determined to
              develop into gastrodermal cells receive zooxanthellae during
              cleavage. This determination appears to take place, at the latest,
              by the second cell division at the four-cell stage.",

              PAEs are synthetic organic compounds poorly soluble in water but
              soluble in organic solvents. Into the environment, they are
              introduced during the production, use and degradation, packaging,
              and transportation of plastic products. In the environment, PAEs
              are degraded in three ways: by hydrolysis, photodegradation, and
              microbial degradation, whereas the biodegradation and hydrolysis
              of PAEs in the environment are very slow. PAEs are pollutants of

              flexibly integrate these across tools and large sample sets.
              Assessing analysis results across an entire project can be time
              consuming and error prone; batch effects and outlier samples can
              easily be missed in the early stages of analysis. RESULTS: We
              present MultiQC, a tool to create a single report visualising
              output from multiple tools across many samples, enabling global
              trends and biases to be quickly identified. MultiQC can plot data
              from many common bioinformatics tools and is built to allow easy
              extension and customization. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION:
              MultiQC is available with an GNU GPLv3 license on GitHub, the

              related to a set of regressors through a linear predictor with
              unknown coeﬃcients and a link function. The model also includes a

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Tropical coral reefs cover only ca. 0.1\% of the
              Earth's surface but harbour exceptional marine biodiversity and
              provide vital ecosystem services to millions of people living
              nearby. They are currently threatened by global (e.g. climate
              change) and local (e.g. chemical pollution) stressors that
              interact in multiple ways. While global stressors cannot be
              mitigated by local actions alone, local stressors can be reduced
              through ecosystem management. Here, we aimed to systematically
              review experimental studies assessing the toxicity of chemical
              pollutants to tropical reef-building corals to generate accessible
              and usable knowledge and data that can be used to calculate
              measurement endpoints in ecological risk assessment. From the
              quantitative estimates of effects, we determined toxicity
              thresholds as the highest exposures tested at which no
              statistically significant adverse effects were observed, and we
              compared them to regulatory predicted no effect concentrations for
              the protection of marine organisms, to assess whether these
              reference values are indeed protective of corals. METHODS: The
              evidence was taken from a systematic map of the impacts of
              chemicals arising from human activity on tropical reef-building
              corals published in 2021. All studies in the map database
              corresponding to the knowledge cluster ``Evidence on the
              ecotoxicological effects of chemicals on corals'' were selected.
              To identify subsequently published literature, the search was
              updated using a subset of the search string used for the
              systematic map. Titles, abstracts and full-texts were screened
              according to the criteria defining the selected cluster of the
              map. Because the eligibility criteria for the systematic review
              are narrower than the criteria used to define the cluster in the
              systematic map, additional screening was performed. Studies
              included were critically appraised and each study was rated as
              low, unclear, medium, or high risk of bias. Data were extracted
              from the studies and synthesised according to a strategy dependent
              on the type of exposure and outcome. REVIEW FINDINGS: The
              systematic review reports the known effects of chemical exposures
              on corals from 847 studies corresponding to 181 articles. A total
              of 697 studies (161 articles) were included in the quantitative
              synthesis and 150 studies (50 articles) in the narrative synthesis
              of the findings. The quantitative synthesis records the effects of
              2706 exposure concentrations-durations of 164 chemicals or
              mixtures of chemicals, and identifies 105 toxicity thresholds
              corresponding to 56 chemicals or mixtures of chemicals. When
              toxicity thresholds were compared to reference values set for the
              protection of marine organisms by environmental agencies, the
              reference values appear to be protective of corals for all but
              three chemicals assessed: the metal copper and the pesticides
              diuron and irgarol 1051. CONCLUSIONS: This open-access database of
              known ecotoxicological effects of chemical exposures on corals can
              assist managers in the ecological risk assessment of chemicals, by
              allowing easy determination of various ecotoxicological
              thresholds. Several limitations of the toxicity tests synthesised
              here were noted (in particular the lack of measurement of
              effective concentrations for more than half of the studies).
              Overall, most of the currently available data on coral toxicity
              should be replicated independently and extended to corals from
              less studied geographical regions and functional groups.",

              To investigate the impacts of urban proximity on corals, we
              conducted a year-long in-natura study - incorporating sampling at
              diel, monthly, and seasonal time points – in which we compared
              corals from an Urban area to corals from a proximal Non-Urban
              area. Here we reveal that despite appearing relatively healthy,
              natural biorhythms and environmental sensory systems were
              extensively disturbed in corals from the Urban environment.
              Transcriptomic data indicated poor symbiont performance,

  abstract = "Background: Maternal mRNA provisioning of oocytes regulates early
              embryogenesis. Maternal transcripts are degraded as zygotic genome
              activation (ZGA) intensifies, a phenomenon known as the
              maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT). Here, we examine gene
              expression over nine developmental stages in the Pacific rice
              coral, Montipora capitata, from eggs and embryos at 1, 4, 9, 14,
              22, and 36 h-post-fertilization (hpf), as well as swimming larvae
              (9d), and adult colonies. Results: Weighted Gene Coexpression
              Network Analysis revealed four expression peaks, identifying the
              maternal complement, two waves of the MZT, and adult expression.
              Gene ontology enrichment revealed maternal mRNAs are dominated by
              cell division, methylation, biosynthesis, metabolism, and
              protein/RNA processing and transport functions. The first MZT wave
              occurs from ~4-14 hpf and is enriched in terms related to
              biosynthesis, methylation, cell division, and transcription. In
              contrast, functional enrichment in the second MZT wave, or ZGA,
              from 22 hpf9dpf, includes ion/peptide transport and cell
              signaling. Finally, adult expression is enriched for functions
              related to signaling, metabolism, and ion/peptide transport. Our
              proposed MZT timing is further supported by expression of enzymes
              involved in zygotic transcriptional repression (Kaiso) and
              activation (Sox2), which peak at 14 hpf and 22 hpf, respectively.
              Further, DNA methylation writing (DNMT3a) and removing (TET1)
              enzymes peak and remain stable past ~4 hpf, suggesting that
              methylome programming occurs before 4 hpf. Conclusions: Our
              high-resolution insight into the coral maternal mRNA and MZT
              provides essential baseline information to understand parental
              carryover effects and the sensitivity of developmental success

              consistent with prior studies indicating that E. marina has lower
              photosynthetic performance than S. muscatinei at high temperature
              and irradiance. The efﬁciency of PSII in both symbionts was
              positively affected by the addition of exogenous catalase,

                   hours post-fertilization; eggs, embryos, larvae, and

                   photosynthetic capacity (photosynthesis and cell density)
                   increased with development, and metabolism shifted from using
                   stored reserves to relying on symbiont-derived resources.
                   Specifically, pathways associated with nutritional exchange,
                   including organic compound transport, glucose and fatty acid
                   metabolism, nitrogen metabolism, and reactive oxygen

                   energetic demands of development in vertically transmitting

              environments, an evaluation of their toxicity is essential.
              Microplastics are a heterogeneous set of materials that differ not
              only in particle properties, like size and shape, but also in
              chemical composition, including polymers, additives and side
              products. Thus far, it remains unknown whether the plastic
              chemicals or the particle itself are the driving factor for
              microplastic toxicity. To address this question, we exposed
              Daphnia magna for 21 days to irregular polyvinyl chloride (PVC),
              polyurethane (PUR) and polylactic acid (PLA) microplastics as well
              as to natural kaolin particles in high concentrations (10, 50,
              100, 500 mg/L, ≤ 59 μm) and different exposure scenarios,
              including microplastics and microplastics without extractable
              chemicals as well as the extracted and migrating chemicals alone.
              All three microplastic types negatively affected the life-history
              of D. magna. However, this toxicity depended on the endpoint and
              the material. While PVC had the largest effect on reproduction,
              PLA reduced survival most effectively. The latter indicates that
              bio-based and biodegradable plastics can be as toxic as their
              conventional counterparts. The natural particle kaolin was less
              toxic than microplastics when comparing numerical concentrations.
              Importantly, the contribution of plastic chemicals to the toxicity
              was also plastic type-specific. While we can attribute effects of
              PVC to the chemicals used in the material, effects of PUR and PLA
              plastics were induced by the mere particle. Our study demonstrates
              that plastic chemicals can drive microplastic toxicity. This
              highlights the importance of considering the individual chemical
              composition of plastics when assessing their environmental risks.
              Our results suggest that less studied polymer types, like PVC and
              PUR, as well as bioplastics are of particular toxicological
              relevance and should get a higher priority in ecotoxicological
              studies.",
